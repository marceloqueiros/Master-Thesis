PART I 
   
  Item 1.      Business    
  General 
  Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in   75   countries. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ ) under the symbol  SBUX.  We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items, including snack offerings, through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice accounts. In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana, Tazo, Seattle s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, La Boulange and Ethos. 
  Our objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve this, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S., and in newer, higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores in each market. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue to offer consumers new coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats. We also believe our Starbucks Global Social Impact strategy, commitments related to ethically sourcing high-quality coffee, contributing positively to the communities we do business in and being an employer of choice are contributors to our objective. 
  In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 10-K  or  Report ) for the fiscal year ended   October 1, 2017   ( fiscal   2017   ), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as  Starbucks,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our.  
  Segment Financial Information 
  We have   four   reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America; 2) China/Asia Pacific ( CAP  3) Europe, Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ) and 4) Channel Development. We also have several non-reportable operating segments, including Teavana retail stores and Seattle's Best Coffee, as well as certain developing businesses such as Siren Retail, which includes the Starbucks Reserve   TM    Roastery   Tasting Rooms, certain Starbucks Reserve   TM    locations and Princi operations. Collectively, the combined group of non-reportable operating segments will be referred to as All Other Segments. Revenues from our reportable segments and All Other Segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal   2017   were as follows: Americas (  70%  ), CAP (  14%  ), EMEA (  5%  ), Channel Development (  9%  ) and All Other Segments (  2%  ). 
  Our Americas, CAP, and EMEA segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our CAP and EMEA operations are still in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our Americas operations. The Americas, CAP and EMEA segments also include certain foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada, Japan and the U.K.  
  Our Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo        teas, Starbucks- and Tazo-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino       , Starbucks Doubleshot        and Starbucks Refreshers        beverages and other branded products sold worldwide through channels such as grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and U.S. foodservice accounts. 
  Starbucks segment information is included in    Note 16   , Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.

Revenue Components 
  We generate nearly all of our revenues through company-operated stores, licensed stores, consumer packaged goods ( CPG ) and foodservice operations.  
  Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of   October 1, 2017    

The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region. 
  Company-operated Stores 
  Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for   79%   of total net revenues during fiscal   2017  . Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food and snack offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique   Starbucks Experience  . The   Starbucks Experience   is built upon superior customer service and a seamless digital experience as well as clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty. 
  Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and local business practices.

Company-operated store data for the year-ended   October 1, 2017  : 

(1)    China/Asia Pacific store data includes the transfer of 133 Singapore company-operated retail stores to licensed stores as a result of the sale to Maxim's Caterers Limited in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  Starbucks        company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and in select rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, inclusive of Drive Thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are focused on an elevated   Starbucks Experience   for our customers. 
  Retail sales mix by product type for company-operated stores:

Stored Value Cards 
  The Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards        (previously My Starbucks Rewards       )       loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan, Latin America, and many of our markets in our CAP and EMEA segments. Stored value cards can also be obtained on-line, via the Starbucks        Mobile App, and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks        Mobile App in participating stores, which also include certain Teavana         locations. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks        Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in the U.S. and Canada. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards        program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ( Stars ) earned. Refer to    Note 1   , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. 
  Licensed Stores 
  Revenues from our licensed stores accounted for   11%   of total net revenues in fiscal   2017  . Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in our share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee.  
  In our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. For Starbucks        and Teavana        stores within certain international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.

  Consumer Packaged Goods 
  Revenues from sales of consumer packaged goods comprised   8%   of total net revenues in fiscal   2017  . Our consumer packaged goods business includes both domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to grocery, warehouse clubs and specialty retail stores. It also includes revenues from product sales to and licensing revenues from manufacturers that produce and market Starbucks-, Seattle s Best Coffee- and Tazo-branded products through licensing agreements.

     Table of Contents  

Foodservice 
  Revenues from foodservice accounts comprised   2%   of total net revenues in fiscal   2017  . We sell Starbucks        and Seattle s Best Coffee        roasted whole bean and ground coffees, a selection of premium Tazo        teas, Starbucks VIA        Ready Brew, and other coffee and tea-related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry, education, healthcare, office coffee distributors, hotels, restaurants, airlines and other retailers. We also sell our Seattle s Best Coffee        through arrangements with national accounts. The majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with SYSCO Corporation, U.S. Foodservice and other distributors. 
  Product Supply 
  Starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees. 
  The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude   arabica   coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the  C  coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the   arabica   coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. 
  We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base  C  coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to  fix  the base  C  coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base  C  coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. Total green coffee purchase commitments as of   October 1, 2017   were   $1.2 billion  , comprised of   $860 million   under fixed-price contracts and an estimated   $336 million   under price-to-be-fixed contracts. As of   October 1, 2017  , none of our price-to-be-fixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts. All price-to-be-fixed contracts as of   October 1, 2017   were at the Company s option to fix the base  C  coffee commodity price component. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal   2018  . 
  We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote. 
  To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates   eight   farmer support centers. The farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality, yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts. 
  In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote. 
  Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks        stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. Our food program continues to develop, and we expect the amount of food products purchased to impact our operations. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote.

Competition 
  Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops offering premium and artisanal products and experiences. In almost all markets in which we do business, there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the U.S. quick-service restaurant sector and the U.S. ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to well-established companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores. 
  Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and U.S. foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.  
  Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names 
  Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, Tazo, Seattle s Best Coffee, Teavana, Frappuccino, Starbucks VIA and La Boulange are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. 
  We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including  Starbucks.com,   Starbucks.net,   Tazo.com,   Seattlesbest.com  and  Teavana.com.  
  Seasonality and Quarterly Results 
  Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 
  Employees 
  Starbucks employed approximately   277,000   people worldwide as of   October 1, 2017  . In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately   185,000   people, with approximately   175,000   in company-operated stores and the remainder in support facilities, store development, and roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately   92,000   employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately   89,000   in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. The number of Starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.

  Item 1A.     Risk Factors    
  You should carefully consider the risks described below. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.  
     As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to Starbucks or competitors' lower priced products as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit and economic uncertainty. These factors may also result in a general downturn in the restaurant industry. Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales de-leveraging, which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales, net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis.  

Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value, either through our actions or those of our business partners, could have a negative impact on our financial results.  
     We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S., where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.

Additionally, our business strategy, including our plans for new stores, foodservice, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, particularly in our international markets, and third party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly in our international Channel Development business. Licensees and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures they may face. We believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a company-operated store or a licensed store. We also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. And although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served in those locations. 
  Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust, such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, product recalls or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media, or result in litigation, and failure to respond appropriately to these incidents, can significantly reduce brand value, result in civil and criminal liability and have a negative impact on our financial results. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products or the use of customer data, fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. 

Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business.  
     Instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, including produce (such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices), dairy products (such as milk and cheeses), non-dairy alternative products (such as soymilk and almondmilk) and meats. Additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers. If customers become ill from food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well as recall products. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations.  
  Some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories,  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, potential imposition of additional taxes on certain types of beverages, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.  

The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. 
     Our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs, and for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers, can contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use or destruction of customers' or employees' data or that of the Company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. For example, the European Union adopted a new regulation that becomes effective in May 2018, called the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to these incidents. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.  
  Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.  
  Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business partners or service providers, even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred, can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. 

We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and could adversely affect our financial results. 
     We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our priority to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Our ability to effectively manage our business, launch digital and other initiatives, and coordinate the production, distribution, administration and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. We also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third party software or services, errors by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners  or service providers  systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. 
             
    We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.  
     There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:  
             
    being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience; 
                
    building our leadership position around coffee, including through the development of Starbucks Reserve        Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve  stores; 
                
    driving convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities; 
                
    increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats;  
                
    moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets; 
                
    creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup;  
                
    continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business; and 
                
    delivering continued growth in our tea business through the Teavana brand in our Starbucks        retail stores and other channels and internationally. 
     In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could adversely impact our business and financial results, include the following: 
             
    increases in labor costs, both domestically and internationally, such as general market and minimum wage levels and investing in competitive compensation, increased health care and workers  compensation insurance costs and other benefits to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets, whether due to regulatory mandates, changing industry practices or our expansion into new channels or technology dependent operations;  
                
    increasing competition in channels in which we operate or seek to operate from new and existing large competitors that sell high-quality specialty coffee beverages;  
                
    continuing disruption in retail caused by on-line commerce, resulting in reduced foot traffic to  brick   mortar  retail stores; 
                
    consumers shifting categories of where they spend their discretionary income away from outside-the-home food and beverage; 
                
    construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally;  
                
    not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings;  
                
    the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovation;  
                
    lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Teavana brand in our Starbucks        retail stores and other channels) and platforms (such as mobile technology), or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced; 
                
    the degree to which we enter into, maintain, develop and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements;  
                
    not successfully consummating favorable strategic transactions or integrating acquired businesses; and 
                
    the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives.  
     Additionally, our Channel Development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partners provide our products, and in some markets there are only a few retailers. If our retail business partners do not provide sufficient  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

levels of support for our products, which is at their discretion, it could limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business. Also, a relatively small number of licensee partners own a large number of licensed stores. If such licensee partners are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses, including their licensed stores, it could adversely affect our results in the markets in which they operate their licensed stores. 
  Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model, increase our focus on our Channel Development business, grow our Teavana brand in our Starbucks        retail stores and other channels, and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. Growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality raw materials, to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience. Furthermore, if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives, such as large acquisitions and integrations, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results. 

We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.  
     The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks        stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Additionally, some of our competitors are also our suppliers, which may result in their ability to offer competing products at a lower price than we do. Increased competition in the U.S. packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products, could have a negative effect on our business, including from price discounting we may have to undertake.  

We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our Americas operating segment.  
     Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately   70%   of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal   2017  . If the Americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our U.S. and Canada markets, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. And because the Americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders. 

We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.  
     Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market business units ( MBUs ), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. The broader CAP market is now one of our two significant profit engines driving our global returns, along with our North American business. In particular, both our China and Japan MBUs contribute meaningfully to both consolidated and CAP net revenues and earnings and China in particular is a significant market for our growth. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results. 
  Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations, such as in the U.S. Additionally, our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market.

     Table of Contents  

Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:  
             
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;  
                
    changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets;  
                
    interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations;  
                
    restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;  
                
    import or other business licensing requirements; 
                
    the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; 
                
    limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; 
                
    in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; 
                
    difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets; 
                
    local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; 
                
    delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share; and 
                
    disruption in energy supplies affecting our markets. 
     Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.  

Increases in the cost of high-quality   arabica   coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality   arabica   coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.  
     We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean   arabica   coffee beans and related coffee products. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below. The high-quality   arabica   coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the  C  price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the  C  coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality   arabica   coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base  C  coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. These are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality   arabica   coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.  
  We also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have an adverse impact on our profitability.

Our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control.  
     Our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could adversely impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations:  
             
    increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets; 
                
    adverse outcomes of litigation;  
                
    severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; and 
                
    especially in our larger or fast growing markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, social unrest, and natural disasters, including health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores. 

Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.  
     Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability. 
  Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S., especially countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or experiencing political instability or social unrest, and as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers or vendors. A vendor's or supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues, especially for those products for which we rely on one or few suppliers or vendors, could negatively impact our business and profitability.  

Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.  
     Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales, operating cash flows, and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance. 

The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results.  
     Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives, some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional company-operated store model. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.

Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.  
     Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, NASDAQ, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, privacy (including the European Union s GDPR discussed in more detail in this risk factors section), food and beverage, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

  General 
  Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on   October 1, 2017   included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended on   October 2, 2016   included 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter, and the fiscal year ended on   September 27, 2015   included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages below are calculated excluding the 53   rd    week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. 
   
  Financial Highlights 
              
    Global comparable store sales grew 3% driven by a 3% increase in average ticket.  
                
    Consolidated operating income decreased to   $4.1 billion   in fiscal   2017   compared to operating income of   $4.2 billion   in fiscal   2016  . Fiscal   2017   operating margin was   18.5%   compared to   19.6%   in fiscal   2016  . Operating margin compression in fiscal   2017   was primarily driven by increased partner (employee) and digital investments, largely in the Americas segment, restructuring and impairment charges     and the absence of the 53rd week, partially offset by sales leverage. 
                
    Restructuring and impairment charges for fiscal   2017   were   $153.5 million   and primarily related to our strategic changes in our Teavana business including a partial goodwill impairment, store asset impairments, costs associated with early closure of stores and severance. Additional amounts incurred related to an impairment of our Switzerland retail business and asset impairments of certain Starbucks        company-operated stores in Canada. 
                
    Earnings per share ( EPS ) for fiscal   2017   increased to   $1.97  , compared to EPS of   $1.90   in fiscal 2016, which benefited $0.06 per share from the extra week in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily driven by growth in comparable store sales, improved sales leverage and the gain on the sale of Singapore retail operations, partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges. 
                
    Cash flows from operations were   $4.2 billion   in fiscal   2017   compared to   $4.6 billion   in fiscal   2016  . The change was primarily due to the timing of our cash payments for income taxes. 
        
  Overview 
  Starbucks results for fiscal   2017   continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model, and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners. Consolidated total net revenues increased 5% to $22.4 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 2,320 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 3% growth in global comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week. Consolidated operating income declined $37 million, or 1%, to $4.1 billion. Operating margin declined 110 basis points to 18.5%, primarily due to increased partner investments, largely in the Americas segment, restructuring and impairment charges     and the absence of the 53rd week, partially offset by sales leverage. Earnings per share of $1.97 increased 4% over the prior year earnings per share of $1.90. 
  Americas revenue grew by 6% to $15.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 952 net new store openings over the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 3%, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week. The success of our premium food offerings coupled with innovation across our coffee and tea beverage platforms drove the increase in comparable store sales. Operating income declined $79 million to $3.7 billion and operating margin at 23.4% declined by 190 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to increased investments in our store partners, a product mix shift largely towards food, and the absence of the 53rd week. These were partially offset by sales leverage.  
  In our China/Asia Pacific segment, revenues grew by 10% to $3.2 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from the opening of 1,036 net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Operating income grew 21% to $765 million, while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 23.6%. The overall margin expansion was primarily due to the transition to China's new value added tax structure in fiscal 2016 and higher income from our joint venture operations. We now operate 7,479 stores in 15 countries in our China/Asia Pacific segment making this the second largest reportable segment.

     Table of Contents  

We continue to execute on our strategy of repositioning the EMEA segment to a predominantly licensed model. As a result of this strategy, EMEA revenues declined $111 million to $1.0 billion, or 10%, primarily driven by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our Germany retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting the decrease were incremental revenues from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. Operating margin declined 200 basis points to 11.5% primarily due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to our Switzerland retail business, sales deleverage in certain company-operated stores and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores. 
  Channel Development segment revenues grew by 4% to $2.0 billion, primarily driven by increased sales through our international channels and sales of packaged coffee, foodservice and single-serve products. When excluding the revenue of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, segment revenues grew by 6%. Operating income grew $86 million, or 11%, to $893 million. Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 44.5%, primarily driven by lower coffee costs, leverage on cost of sales and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. 
  Fiscal   2018     The View Ahead 
  Turning to fiscal   2018  , we expect continued growth through thoughtful long-term investments that create value and reward shareholders. These results are expected to be driven by our 6 operational priorities, which include: 
             
    Accelerate U.S. Comparable Store Sales 
                
    Drive Innovation in Food and Beverage 
                
    Accelerate the Power and Momentum of our Digital Platform 
                
    Enable Long-Term Growth in China  
                
    Elevate the   Starbucks Experience   through Siren Retail 
                
    Gain Share of At-Home Coffee 
     These priorities are our main focus to grow our core business with new customer acquisition through store growth, digital engagement and innovation, while we continue to foster long-term customer relationships. To successfully achieve these priorities, we will undertake a number of initiatives, including the pending transaction to acquire full ownership of our joint venture in East China and converting our Taiwan and Singapore markets to fully licensed operations. We are in the process of exiting certain activities including closing Teavana  retail stores and certain Starbucks company-operated stores in Canada, the pending sale of our Tazo brand and related assets, and aggressively rationalizing merchandise in our U.S. retail stores. These strategic actions will enable us to focus on businesses and products with the highest growth potential and greatest prospect for returns. We expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits for the underlying business in fiscal 2018 driven by comparable store sales and the opening of approximately 2,300 net new Starbucks stores globally. An additional 2 to 3 points of revenue growth is expected related to the aforementioned strategic initiatives. 
  Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 is expected to grow in excess of 40% when compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to the anticipated gain associated with the pending acquisition of East China.  
  Capital expenditures in fiscal   2018   are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion, primarily for investments in our new and existing stores, our developing Siren Retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities. 
  During the fiscal year, our expected strong operational performance combined with the prudent leveraging of our balance sheet will enable us to return significant value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   FISCAL   2017   COMPARED TO FISCAL   2016    
  Consolidated results of operations   (in millions)  : 
  Revenues 

Total net revenues increased   $1.1 billion  , or   5%  , over fiscal   2016  , primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores (  $807 million  ). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 768 net new Starbucks        company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($869 million) and a   3%   increase in comparable store sales ($496 million), attributable to a   3%   increase in average ticket. Partially offsetting these incremental revenues was the absence of the 53rd week ($324 million), the absence of sales from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($121 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($70 million).  
  Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenue (  $201 million  ), primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($260 million), largely due to the opening of 1,552 net new Starbucks        licensed stores and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($41 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($27 million). 
  CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased   $64 million  , driven by increased sales through our international channels, primarily associated with our European and North American regions ($35 million), increased sales of U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million), foodservice ($30 million) and premium single-serve products ($23 million). Increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($47 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to periods prior to fiscal 2017 ($13 million). 
  Operating Expenses 

Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily driven by a product mix shift (approximately 70 basis points) largely towards premium food in the Americas segment, partially offset by leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 30 basis points).  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by higher partner and digital investments, largely in the Americas segment (approximately 150 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 90 basis points). 
  Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points).  
  General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 30 basis points), and employment taxes, including the lapping of higher employment taxes resulting from a multiple year audit in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points). These were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations. 
  Restructuring and impairments charges in fiscal 2017 were primarily the result of our strategic changes in Teavana. We recorded $130 million of restructuring related costs, including a partial goodwill impairment of $69 million, store asset impairments, and costs related to early store closure obligations and severance. Additionally, we recorded $18 million of partial goodwill impairment relating to our Switzerland retail business. 
  Income from equity investees increased $73 million, due to higher income from our CAP joint venture operations, primarily China     and South Korea, as well as our North American Coffee Partnership. 
  The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 110 basis points in fiscal   2017   when compared to fiscal   2016  . 
  Other Income and Expenses 

Interest income and other, net increased   $167 million  , primarily driven by gains from the sale of our Singapore retail operations ($84 million) and our investment in Square, Inc. warrants ($41 million). Also contributing favorably was higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($44 million).  
  Interest expense increased   $11 million   primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in February 2016, May 2016 and March 2017, partially offset by lower interest expense from the repayment of our December 2016 notes.  
  The effective tax rate for fiscal   2017   was   33.2%   compared to   32.9%   for fiscal   2016  . The   increase   in the effective tax rate was primarily due to unfavorability from non-deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points), and the lapping of the release of certain tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily related to statute closures (approximately 30 basis points). The increase was partially offset by the largely non-taxable gain on the sale of our Singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points).

Revenues 
  Americas total net revenues for fiscal   2017   increased   $857 million  , or   6%  , over fiscal   2016  , primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing   $749 million  ) and licensed stores (contributing   $99 million  ). 
  The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 383 net new Starbucks        company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($585 million) and a   3%   increase in     comparable store sales ($426 million), attributable to a   4%   increase in average ticket, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($258 million)  
  The increase in licensed store revenues was primarily driven by increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($127 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 569 net new Starbucks        licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($31 million).

EMEA 

R  evenues 
  EMEA total net revenues for fiscal   2017   decreased   $111 million  , or   10%  , over fiscal   2016  . The decrease was primarily due to a decline in company-operated store revenues ($181 million), driven by the shift to more licensed stores in the region ($121 million), which includes the absence of revenues related to the sale of our Germany retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Also contributing to the decline was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($43 million) and the absence of the 53rd week ($11 million).  
  License  d store revenues increased   $68 million  , driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($95 million), resulting from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 14 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($24 million) and the absence of the 53rd week ($6 million). 
  Operating Expenses 
  Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues in  creased 240 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency transactions (approximately 140 basis points) and the shift in the composition of our store portfolio to more licensed stores, which have a lower gross margin (approximately 100 basis points). 
  Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues   decreased 210 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 330 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage in certain company-operated stores     (approximately 320 basis points) and the impact of a tax settlement (approximately 100 basis points), partially offset by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores (approximately 140 basis points). 
  Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 70 basis points.

  Restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2017 relate to a partial goodwill impairment recorded in our Switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit, which we fully acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The overall economic backdrop in Europe, coupled with the strengthening of the Swiss franc when compared to the relatively inexpensive euro in surrounding countries, caused ongoing unfavorable changes in consumer behavior and depressed tourism. Our latest mitigation

efforts for our Switzerland retail business are not expected to fully recover the reporting unit's carrying value given the sustained nature of these and other external factors. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 200 basis points in fiscal   2017   when compared to fiscal   2016  .  
   
  Channel Development 

Discussion of our Channel Development segment results reflects the impact of an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. While this adjustment was immaterial, the discussion below quantifies the impact to provide a better understanding of our results for fiscal   2017  . 
  Revenues 
  Channel Development total net revenues for fiscal   2017   increased   $76 million  , or   4%  , over fiscal   2016  . CPG revenue growth was driven by increased sales through our international channels, primarily associated with our European and North American regions ($35 million), U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million) and premium single-serve products ($23 million). Higher foodservice sales were primarily the result of a change to a direct distribution model and recognizing the benefit of full revenue from premium single-serve product sales. Increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($40 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods ($13 million).  
  Operating Expenses 
  Cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 50 basis points, primarily driven by lower coffee costs (approximately 90 basis points) and leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), partially offset by a shift toward lower margin products (approximately 100 basis points) and the revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods (approximately 30 basis points).  
  Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 40 basis points). 
  General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 40 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points) and salaries and benefits (approximately 10 basis points). 
  Income from equity investees increased $28 million for fiscal   2017  , due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, driven by increased sales of Frappuccino        and Starbucks Doubleshot        beverages as well as new product launches over the past 12 months. 
  The combination of these changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 270 basis points in fiscal   2017   when compared to fiscal   2016  .

All Other Segments primarily includes Teavana-branded stores, Seattle s Best Coffee, as well as certain developing businesses such as Siren Retail. The increase in the operating loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges related to our strategy to close Teavana  retail stores and focus on Teavana  tea within Starbucks        stores. We recorded $69 million for the partial impairment of goodwill and $60 million in restructuring-related costs, including asset impairments, costs associated with the early closure of stores and their related obligations, and severance. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   FISCAL   2016   COMPARED TO FISCAL   2015    
    
  Consolidated results of operations   (in millions)  : 
  Revenues 

Total net revenues increased $2.2 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.6 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by 5% growth in comparable store sales ($793 million), incremental revenues from 693 net new Starbucks  company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($724 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($324 million) and incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($105 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of revenue from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($151 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($99 million). 
  Licensed store revenue growth contributed $292 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($285 million), largely due to the opening of 1,372 net new Starbucks  licensed stores, the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($41 million). Partially offsetting these

increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($33 million) and a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($6 million). 
  CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $214 million, primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products ($106 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($47 million), and increased foodservice sales ($34 million) and U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million). 
  Operating Expenses 

Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 70 basis points) and lower commodity costs (approximately 50 basis points). 
  Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily driven by increased investments in partners (employees) and digital platforms (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 30 basis points). 
  Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to a settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the closure of Target Canada stores in the prior year (approximately 50 basis points), the lapping of impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 20 basis points). 
  General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits (approximately 30 basis points). 
  Income from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points due to higher income from our joint venture operations, primarily from our North American Coffee Partnership and our joint ventures in China and South Korea. 
  The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 80 basis points over fiscal 2015.

Other Income and Expenses 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition. 
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the  2017 notes ), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as the derecognition of the capitalized issuance costs and unamortized discount. 
  Interest income and other, net increased $65 million, primarily due to higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($21 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations ($11 million) and gains on our trading securities portfolio ($8 million). 
  Interest expense increased $11 million primarily due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in February and May 2016. 
  Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% for fiscal 2015. The increase in the rate for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain in the prior year associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Cash and Investment Overview 
  Our cash and investments were   $3.2 billion   and   $3.4 billion   as of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), mortgage and asset-backed securities, agency obligations, and state and local government obligations. As of   October 1, 2017  , approximately   $2.1 billion   of cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.  
  Borrowing capacity 
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we replaced our $1.5 billion 2016 credit facility with a new $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the  2018 credit facility ) and a $1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the  364-day credit facility ), which are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. 
  The 2018 credit facility, of which   $150 million   may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on   October 25, 2022  . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional   $500 million  . Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard   Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is   0.565%   for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and   0.00%   (nil) for Base Rate Loans.  
  The 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on   October 24, 2018  . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional   $500 million  . Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is   0.585%   for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and   0.00%   (nil) for Base Rate Loans. 
  Both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of   October 1, 2017  , we were in compliance  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

with all applicable 2016 credit facility covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2016 credit facility as of   October 1, 2017  . 
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we increased our commercial paper program from $1 billion to   $3 billion  , allowing us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to this maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time. Individual maturities may vary but cannot exceed   397 days   from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facilities discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  As of   October 1, 2017  , we had no borrowings under our former commercial paper program.  
  In March 2017, we issued Japanese yen-denominated long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering. The 7-year 0.372% Senior Notes (the  2024 notes ) due March 2024 were issued with a face value of  85 billion, or $758.3 million, as of   July 2, 2017  . We will use the net proceeds from the offering to enhance our sustainability programs around coffee supply chain management through eligible sustainability projects. Interest on the 2024 notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2017. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our   $400 million   of   0.875%   Senior Notes (the  2016 notes ) were repaid. 
  See    Note 9   , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. 
  The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of   October 1, 2017  , we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.  
  Use of Cash 
  We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses such as Siren Retail. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. As discussed in    Note 15   , Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, we committed to purchase the remaining   50%   ownership interest in our East China joint venture for approximately   $1.3 billion  . This transaction is expected to close by early calendar year 2018, primarily through the use of cash and investments held in foreign subsidiaries. 
  We believe that future cash flows generated from operations, existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future.  
  We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of   October 1, 2017   to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the U.S., we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation. 
  During each of the first three quarters of fiscal   2016  , we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of   $0.20   per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal   2016   and each of the first three quarters of fiscal   2017   we declared and paid a cash dividend of   $0.25   per share. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal   2017   and   2016   totaled   $1,450.4 million   and   $1,178.0 million  , respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal   2017  , we declared a cash dividend of   $0.30   per share to be paid on     December 1, 2017   with an expected payout of approximately $  429.5   million. 
  During fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , we repurchased   37.5 million   and   34.9 million   shares of common stock, respectively, or   $2.1 billion   and   $2.0 billion  , respectively, under our ongoing share repurchase program. At   October 1, 2017  , the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase under our ongoing share repurchase program totaled   80.3 million  .

     Table of Contents  

Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2018 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our developing Siren Retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately   $2 billion  . 
  Cash Flows 
  Cash   provided   by operating activities was   $4.2 billion   for fiscal   2017  , compared to   $4.6 billion   for fiscal   2016  . The change was primarily due to the timing of our cash payments for income taxes. 
  Cash   used   by investing activities totaled   $0.9 billion   for fiscal   2017  , compared to   $2.2 billion   for fiscal   2016  . The change was primarily due to the liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in anticipation of the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership share of our East China joint venture. 
  Cash   used   by financing activities for fiscal   2017   totaled   $3.0 billion  , compared to   $1.8 billion   for fiscal   2016  . The change was primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, the repayment of the 2016 notes and an increase in cash returned to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of   October 1, 2017  , and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (  in millions  ): 

(1)   
    Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments were excluded. As of   October 1, 2017  , we excluded   $207.3 million   of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, which includes accrued interest and penalties.   
               (2)   
    Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. 
               (3)   
    Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise   91%   of total purchase obligations. 
               (4)   
    Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations and hedging instruments. 
     Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Off-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in    Item 8    of Part II of this 10-K. 
   
  COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS 
  Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality   arabica   coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in    Item 1   , as well as Risk Factors in    Item 1A    of this 10-K.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
  Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. Excluding interest rate swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of   three years  . Refer to    Note 1   , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and    Note 3   , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments. 
  The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure. 
  The following table summarizes the potential impact as of   October 1, 2017   to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ( OCI ) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items   (in millions)  :

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See    Note 3   , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion. 
  The following table summarizes the potential impact as of   October 1, 2017   to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Equity Security Price Risk 
  We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our trading securities portfolio. Trading securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan ( MDCP ). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. 
  We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of   October 1, 2017   and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.

Interest Rate Risk 
  Long-term Debt 
  We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See    Note 3   , Derivative Financial Instruments and    Note 9   , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of   October 1, 2017  .

    Amount disclosed is net of ($42 million) change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to    Note 3   , Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge. 
     Available-for-Sale Securities 
  Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of   October 1, 2017   and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. 
   
  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 
  Our significant accounting policies are discussed in    Note 1   , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity. 
  We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past four fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.

     Table of Contents  

Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets 
  We evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.  
  Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses. 
  Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance.  
  During fiscal 2017, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions, aside from those related to the long-term strategy assumptions of our Teavana-branded retail stores, which had a significant impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. 
  Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  
  We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches. 
  When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. 
  When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our

ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. 
  The partial goodwill impairments of the Teavana and Switzerland reporting units are discussed in    Note 8   , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.  
  Income Taxes 
  We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future; however, we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss).  
  In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in    Note 13   , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities. 
  We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to U.S. income taxes. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. 
  Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

  Note 1:    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Description of Business 
  We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh and prepared food items, through our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and national foodservice accounts.  
  In this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as  Starbucks,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our.  
  We have   four   reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America; 2) China/Asia Pacific ( CAP  3) Europe, Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ) and 4) Channel Development. We also have several non-reportable operating segments, including Teavana, Seattle's Best Coffee and Evolution Fresh, as well as certain developing businesses such as Siren Retail, which includes the Starbucks Reserve   TM    Roastery   Tasting Rooms, Starbucks Reserve brand and products and Princi operations, which are combined and referred to as All Other Segments. Unallocated corporate operating expenses, which pertain primarily to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment, are presented as a reconciling item between total segment operating results and consolidated financial results.  
  Additional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in    Note 16   , Segment Reporting. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  Our consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Investments in entities that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method. Investments in entities in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
  Fiscal Year End 
  Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal year   2017   and   2015   included   52   weeks. Fiscal year   2016   included 53 weeks, with the 53   rd    week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. 
  Estimates and Assumptions 
  Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  We consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within   two   to   five   business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. 
  Our cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

     Table of Contents  

Investments 
  Available-for-sale Securities 
  Our short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale securities for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis. 
  Trading Securities 
  We also have a trading securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Trading securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan ( MDCP ). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. 
  Equity and Cost Method Investments  
  Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity method investments are included within long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity method investees are classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings.  
  Equity investments for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting and are recorded in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the cost method, investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, certain distributions and additional investments. 
  We evaluate our equity and cost method investments for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such investments may not be recoverable. We review several factors to determine whether the loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the investment s anticipated recovery. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in net earnings.  
  Fair Value 
  Fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following: 
  Level 1:   The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For trading and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value.  
  Level 2:   When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and our over-the-counter forward contracts, collars and swaps based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. 
  Level 3:   We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity.  
  Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and cost method investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below.

Derivative Instruments 
  We manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit the range of possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. 
  We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Excluding interest rate swaps and foreign currency debt, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than   three years   or offset derivative assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted   when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of     October 1, 2017     and     October 2, 2016  , we received and posted     $5.8 million   and     $19.5 million  , respectively, of cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under collateral security arrangements. As of     October 1, 2017     and     October 2, 2016  , the potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and liabilities of     $7.4 million   and   $9.4 million  ,   respectively, resulting in net derivative assets of     $30.4 million   a  nd net derivative liabilities of   $  31.1 million     as of     October 1, 2017  , and net derivative assets of     $24.7 million     and net derivative liabilities of $  80.2 million     as of     October 2, 2016  . 
  By using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.  
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.  
  To the extent that the change in the fair value of the contract corresponds to the change in the value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly basis, the hedge is considered effective and is recognized as described above. The remaining change in fair value of the contract represents the ineffective portion, which is immediately recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.  
  Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the terms of the contract to the underlying transaction. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges generally remain designated as such until the hedged item impacts net earnings, or the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur. For de-designated cash flow hedges or for transactions that are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the nature of the underlying transaction.  
  Net Investment Hedges 
  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.  
  To the extent that the change in the fair value of the forward contract corresponds to the change in value of the anticipated transactions using spot rates on a monthly basis, the hedge is considered effective and is recognized as described above. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract represents the ineffective portion, which is immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.

Fair Value Hedges 
  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged item are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings.  
  Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments 
  We also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The change in the fair value of these contracts is immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.  
  Normal Purchase Normal Sale 
  We enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase commitments, which are described further at    Note 5   , Inventories. For both fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, we expect to take delivery of and to utilize the coffee in a reasonable period of time and in the conduct of normal business. Accordingly, these purchase commitments qualify as normal purchases and are not recorded at fair value on our balance sheets. 
  Refer to    Note 3   , Derivative Financial Instruments, and    Note 5   , Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments.  
  Receivables, net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  Our receivables are mainly comprised of receivables for product and equipment sales to and royalties from our licensees, as well as receivables from our consumer packaged goods ( CPG ) and foodservice business customers. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical experience, customer credit risk and application of the specific identification method. As of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , our allowance for doubtful accounts was   $9.8 million   and   $9.4 million  , respectively. 
  Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or market. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , inventory reserves were   $38.4 million   and   $39.6 million  , respectively. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment, which includes assets under capital leases, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from   2   to   15 years   for equipment and   30   to   40 years   for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally   10 years  . For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives.  
  The portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in cost of sales including occupancy costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. 
  We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level.

     Table of Contents  

We recognized net disposition charges of   $46.9 million  ,   $25.1 million  , and   $12.5 million   in fiscal   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. Additionally, we recognized net impairment charges of   $56.1 million  ,   $24.1 million  , and   $25.8 million   in fiscal   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively, of which   $39.9 million   in fiscal 2017 were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings. For assets within our retail operations, net impairment and disposition charges are recorded in store operating expenses. For all other assets, these charges are recorded in cost of sales including occupancy costs, other operating expenses or general and administrative expenses. 
  Goodwill 
  We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. 
  As part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets.  
  As noted above, if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur. Due to the strategic decision to close Teavana branded retail stores and our subsequent review of this reporting unit's fair value, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of   $69.3 million   during the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  
  Additionally, we recorded a partial goodwill impairment of   $17.9 million   related to our Switzerland retail reporting unit during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to ongoing macro economic factors. There were no material goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal   2016   and   2015  . Refer to    Note 8   , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further discussions. 
  Other Intangible Assets 
  Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contract-based patents and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above.  
  Indefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change. 
  There were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  .

Insurance Reserves 
  We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers  compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance and director and officers  liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to and royalty and other fees from licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates. 
  Company-operated Store Revenues 
  Company-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale. Company-operated store revenues are reported net of sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. 
  Licensed Store Revenues 
  Licensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales to licensees, as well as royalties and other fees paid by licensees. Sales of coffee, tea, food and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales including occupancy costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. 
  Initial nonrefundable development fees for licensed stores are recognized upon substantial performance of services for new market business development activities, such as initial business, real estate and store development planning, as well as providing operational materials and functional training courses for opening new licensed retail markets. Additional store licensing fees are recognized when new licensed stores are opened. Royalty revenues based upon a percentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized on a monthly basis when earned. 
  CPG, Foodservice and Other Revenues 
  CPG, foodservice and other revenues primarily include sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to grocery, warehouse clubs and specialty retail stores, sales to our national foodservice accounts, and revenues from sales of products to and license fee revenues from manufacturers that produce and market Starbucks-, Seattle s Best Coffee- and Tazo-branded products through licensing agreements. Sales of coffee, tea, ready-to-drink beverages and related products to grocery and warehouse club stores are generally recognized when received by the customer or distributor, depending on contract terms. Revenues are recorded net of sales discounts given to customers for trade promotions and other incentives and for sales return allowances, which are determined based on historical patterns. 
  Revenues from sales of products to manufacturers that produce and market Starbucks-, Seattle s Best Coffee- and Tazo-branded products through licensing agreements are generally recognized when the product is received by the manufacturer or distributor. License fee revenues from manufacturers are based on a percentage of sales and are recognized on a monthly basis when earned. National foodservice account revenues are recognized when the product is received by the customer or distributor. 
  Sales to customers through CPG channels and national foodservice accounts, including sales to national distributors, are recognized net of certain fees paid to the customer. We characterize these fees as a reduction of revenue unless we are able to identify a sufficiently separable benefit from the customer's purchase of our products such that we could have entered into an exchange transaction with a party other than the customer in order to receive such benefit, and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of such benefit. 
  Stored Value Cards 
  Stored value cards, primarily Starbucks Cards, can be activated at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at StarbucksStore.com or via mobile devices held by our customers, and at certain other third party locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at these third party locations. When an amount is loaded onto a stored value card at any of these locations, we recognize a corresponding liability for the full amount loaded onto the card, which is recorded within stored value card liability on our consolidated balance sheets.  
  Stored value cards can be redeemed at company-operated and most licensed stores, as well as online. When a stored value card is redeemed at a company-operated store or online, we recognize revenue by reducing the stored value card liability. When a  
  
   57 

     Table of Contents  

stored value card is redeemed at a licensed store location, we reduce the corresponding stored value card liability and cash, which is reimbursed to the licensee.  
  There are no expiration dates on our stored value cards, and in most markets, we do not charge service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. While we will continue to honor all stored value cards presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood of redemption, based on historical experience, is deemed to be remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, if management also determines there is no requirement for remitting balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, unredeemed card balances may then be recognized as breakage income, which is included in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. In fiscal   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , we recognized breakage income of   $104.6 million  ,   $60.5 million  , and   $39.3 million  , respectively.  
  Loyalty Program  
  In the U.S. and Canada, effective April 2016, we modified our transaction-based loyalty program, My Starbucks Rewards        to a spend-based program, Starbucks Rewards   TM   . For fiscal 2016, the existing transaction-based programs remain unchanged for other markets. During fiscal 2017, we launched Starbucks Rewards   TM    in Japan. Customers in the U.S., Canada, and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the program. They earn loyalty points ( Stars ) with each purchase at participating Starbucks        and Teavana   TM    stores, as well as on certain packaged coffee products purchased in select Starbucks        stores, online, and through CPG channels. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.  
  Regardless of whether it is a spend or transaction-based program, we defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by our program members towards free product as each Star is earned, and a corresponding liability is established within stored value card liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The estimated selling price of each Star earned is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of Stars we do not expect to be redeemed, based on historical redemption patterns. Stars generally expire if inactive for a period of six months.  
  When a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related loyalty program liability.  
  Advertising 
  We expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled   $282.6 million  ,   $248.6 million   and   $227.9 million   in fiscal   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
  Store Preopening Expenses 
  Costs incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new store openings are expensed as incurred. 
  Leases 
  Operating Leases 
  We lease retail stores, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities and office space for corporate administrative purposes under operating leases. Most lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, lease premiums, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. We recognize amortization of lease incentives, premiums and minimum rent expenses on a straight-line basis beginning on the date of initial possession, which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation for intended use.  
  For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, we record a deferred rent liability within accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense in cost of sales including occupancy costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. 
  For premiums paid upfront to enter a lease agreement, we record a prepaid rent asset in prepaid expenses and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortize the premium over the terms of the leases as additional rent expense in cost of sales including occupancy costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. 
  For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial possession, we record minimum rent expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in cost of sales including occupancy costs on our consolidated statements of earnings, with the adjustments to cash rent accrued as deferred rent in our consolidated balance sheets.

     Table of Contents  

Certain leases provide for contingent rent, which is determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels. We record a contingent rent liability in accrued occupancy costs within accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when we determine that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable. 
  When ceasing operations of company-operated stores under operating leases, in cases where the lease contract specifies a termination fee due to the landlord, we record such expense at the time written notice is given to the landlord. In cases where terms, including termination fees, are yet to be negotiated with the landlord, we will record the expense upon signing of an agreement with the landlord. In cases where the landlord does not allow us to prematurely exit the lease, we recognize an expense equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments to the landlord less any projected sublease income at the cease-use date. 
  Lease Financing Arrangements 
  We are sometimes involved in the construction of leased buildings, primarily stores. When we qualify as the deemed owner of these buildings due to significant involvement during the construction period under build-to-suit lease accounting requirements and do not qualify for sales recognition under sales-leaseback accounting guidance, we record the cost of the related buildings in property, plant and equipment. The offsetting lease financing obligations are recorded in other long-term liabilities, with the current portion recorded in in accrued occupancy costs within accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. These assets and obligations are amortized in depreciation and amortization and interest expense, respectively, on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the terms of the related lease agreements. 
  Asset Retirement Obligations 
  We recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ( ARO ) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in cost of sales including occupancy costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were   $12.4 million   and   $9.3 million  , respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were   $70.0 million   and   $67.9 million  , respectively. 
  Stock-based Compensation 
  We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs ) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board of Directors and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income and return on invested capital. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.  
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  Our international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.

Income Taxes 
  We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
  We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.  
  In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. 
  Starbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability on our consolidated balance sheets.

  On April 9, 2015, we effected a   two  -for-one stock split of our   $0.001   par value common stock for shareholders of record as of March 30, 2015. All share and per-share data in our consolidated financial statements and notes has been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split. We adjusted shareholders' equity to reflect the stock split by reclassifying an amount equal to the par value of the additional shares arising from the split from retained earnings to common stock during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, resulting in   no   net impact to shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  Earnings per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met. 
  Common Stock Share Repurchases 
  We may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board of Directors, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings, once additional paid-in capital is depleted.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended its guidance on the financial reporting of hedging relationships. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, expands permissible cash flow hedges on contractually specified components, and simplifies hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment. The guidance will be effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and will require a modified retrospective approach on existing cash flow and net investment hedges. The presentation and disclosure requirements will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption. 
  In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment. Under this new guidance, an impairment charge, if triggered, is calculated as the difference between a reporting unit s carrying value and fair value, but it is limited to the carrying value of goodwill. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we elected to early-adopt this guidance on a prospective basis. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for income tax effects of intercompany sales or transfers of assets other than inventory. The guidance requires entities to recognize the income tax impact of an intra-entity sale or transfer of an asset other than inventory when the sale or transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. The guidance will require a modified retrospective application with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 but permits adoption in an earlier period. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the measurement and recognition of credit losses on most financial assets. For trade receivables, loans, and held-to-maturity debt securities, the current probable loss recognition methodology is being replaced by an expected credit loss model. For available-for-sale debt securities, the recognition model on credit losses is generally unchanged, except the losses will be presented as an adjustable allowance. The guidance will be applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The guidance will become effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2021 but can be adopted as early as the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to stock-based compensation, which changes the accounting and classification of excess tax benefits and minimum tax withholdings on share-based awards. With this adoption, excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation will be prospectively reflected as a reduction of, or increase in, income tax expense in our consolidated statement of earnings instead of additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, within our consolidated statement of cash flows, this guidance will require excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity, rather than a financing activity, in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. As a result, we expect the adoption will have a significant impact on income tax expense and earnings per share, as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings and consolidated statement of cash flows. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. If the new guidance had been adopted for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately   $78 million  ,   $125 million   and   $132 million  , respectively, of excess net tax benefits recorded to additional paid-in capital would have been recorded as a reduction to income tax expense. Excess tax benefits or deficiencies are based on our stock price at the time stock options are exercised or when restricted stock units vest, therefore prior year amounts are not indicative of the future impact of this guidance.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance for financial liabilities resulting from selling prepaid stored value products that are redeemable at third-party merchants. Under the new guidance, expected breakage amounts associated with these products must be recognized proportionately in earnings as redemption occurs. Our current accounting policy of applying the remote method to all of our stored value cards, including cards redeemable at the third-party licensed locations, will no longer be allowed. We will adopt and implement the provisions of this guidance and the new revenue recognition standard issued by the FASB, as discussed below, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the recognition and measurement of leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a lease liability, which represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for most leases. The guidance retains the current accounting for lessors and does not make significant changes to the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows by a lessee. Enhanced disclosures will also be required to give financial statement users the ability to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance will require modified retrospective application at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020, with optional practical expedients, but permits adoption in an earlier period. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. We expect this adoption will result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets but will likely have an insignificant impact on our consolidated statements of earnings. In preparation for adoption of the guidance, we are in the process of implementing controls and key system changes to enable the preparation of financial information.

In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance on the financial statement presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires these costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the related debt liability rather than as an asset. We retrospectively adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which resulted in the reclassification of   $17.0 million   of debt issuance costs previously presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of October 2, 2016. Components of our long-term debt and aggregate debt issuance costs and unamortized premium are disclosed in    Note 9   , Debt.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. This guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the overall impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, as well as the expected method of adoption. Based on our continued assessment, which may identify other accounting impacts, we have determined the adoption will change the timing of recognition and classification of our stored value card breakage income, which is currently recognized using the remote method and recorded in interest income and other, net. The new guidance will require application of the proportional method and classification within total net revenues on our consolidated statements of earnings. Additionally, the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 
   
  Note 2:    Acquisitions and Divestitures 
  Fiscal 2017 
  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold our company-operated retail store assets and operations in Singapore to Maxim's Caterers Limited, converting these operations to a fully licensed market, for a total of   $119.9 million  . This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of   $83.9 million  , which was included in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.  
  Fiscal 2016 
  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our ownership interest in our Germany retail business to AmRest Holdings SE for a total of   $47.3 million  . This transaction converted these company-operated stores to a fully licensed market and resulted in an   insignificant   pre-tax gain, which was included in interest income and other, net on our condensed consolidated statements of earnings. 
  Fiscal 2015 
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we sold our company-operated retail store assets and operations in Puerto Rico to Baristas Del Caribe, LLC, converting these operations to a fully licensed market, for a total of   $8.9 million  . This transaction resulted in an   insignificant   pre-tax gain, which was included in interest income and other, net on the consolidated statements of earnings.  
  On   September 23, 2014  , we entered into a tender offer bid agreement with Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. ( Starbucks Japan ), at the time a   39.5%   owned equity method investment, and our former joint venture partner, Sazaby League, Ltd. ( Sazaby ), to acquire the remaining   60.5%   ownership interest in Starbucks Japan for approximately   $876 million  , through a two-step tender offer.   Acquiring Starbucks Japan further leverages our existing infrastructure to continue disciplined retail store growth and expand our presence into other channels in the Japan market, such as CPG, licensing and foodservice  .

The following table summarizes the final allocation of the total consideration to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of   October 31, 2014  , which are reported within our China/Asia Pacific segment   (in millions)  :  

Other current and long-term assets acquired primarily include various deposits, specifically lease and key money deposits. Accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities assumed primarily include financing obligations associated with build-to-suit leases as well as asset retirement obligations. 
  The intangible assets are finite-lived and include reacquired rights, licensing agreements with Starbucks Japan's current licensees and Starbucks Japan's customer loyalty program. The reacquired rights to exclusively operate licensed Starbucks        retail stores in Japan were assigned a fair value of   $305.0 million  ; these rights will be amortized on a straight-line basis through   March 2021  . Amortization expense for these finite-lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2017 was   $48.4 million  , and, as of   October 1, 2017  , accumulated amortization was   $139.1 million  . Future amortization expense is estimated to be approximately   $47.0 million   each year for the next three years,   $24.0 million   in the fourth year and   $5 million   thereafter.  
  The   $815.6 million   of goodwill represents   the intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and primarily includes the acquired customer base, the acquired workforce including store partners in the region that have strong relationships with these customers, the existing geographic retail and online presence, and the expected geographic presence in new channels  . The goodwill was allocated to the China/Asia Pacific segment and is not deductible for income tax purposes. Due to foreign currency translation, the balance of goodwill related to the acquisition decreased   $32.2 million   to   $783.4 million   as of   October 1, 2017  . 
  As a result of this acquisition, we remeasured the carrying value of our preexisting   39.5%   equity method investment to fair value, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of   $390.6 million   that was presented separately as gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture within other income and expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings.  
  We began consolidating Starbucks Japan's results of operations and cash flows into our consolidated financial statements beginning after   October 31, 2014  . For the year ended   September 27, 2015  , Starbucks Japan's net revenues and net earnings included in our consolidated statement of earnings were   $1.1 billion   and   $108.5 million  , respectively.

  Note 3:    Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Interest Rates 
  We are subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. From time to time, we enter into swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
  To hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates, we enter into interest rate swap agreements related to anticipated debt issuances. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the pricing of the related debt. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. During fiscal 2016, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of   $375 million   related to the   $500 million   and   $250 million   of 5-year   2.100%   Senior Notes (the  2021 notes ) due   February 2021   and   $500 million   of 10-year   2.450%   Senior Notes (the  2026 notes ) due   June 2026  . Refer to    Note 9   , Debt, for details of the components of our long-term debt. We cash settled these swap agreements at the time of pricing the 2021 and 2026 notes. 
  To hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair value of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt are recorded in interest expense and have an insignificant impact on our consolidated statement of earnings. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 related to our   3.850%   Senior Notes due in   October 2023   ( 2023 notes ). Refer to    Note 9   , Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt. 
  Foreign Currency  
  To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to revenue, cost of sales including occupancy costs or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. 
  To mitigate foreign currency transaction risk of intercompany borrowings, we enter into cross-currency swap contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses from these swaps offset the changes in value of interest and principal payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. There are no credit-risk-related contingent features associated with these swaps, although we may hold or post collateral depending upon the gain or loss position of the swap agreements. 
  We also enter into forward contracts or use foreign currency-denominated debt to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in certain international operations. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. 
  To mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain balance sheet items, we enter into foreign currency forward and swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency denominated payables and receivables; both are recorded in interest income and other, net.

Commodities 
  Depending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee futures contracts and collars to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in    Note 5   , Inventories. The effective portion of each derivative's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to cost of sales including occupancy costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. 
  To mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, primarily of dairy products, diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in interest income and other, net and help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in cost of sales including occupancy costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.

The changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the trading securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal years   2017   and   2016   were net gains of   $10.5 million   and   $3.6 million   and a net loss of   $4.5 million   in fiscal year   2015  . Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities were not material as of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  . 
  Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
  Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps, which are described further in    Note 3   , Derivative Financial Instruments.  
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and cost method investments, and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant, and equipment is included at    Note 1   , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  
  Other than the impairments discussed in    Note 8   , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, and the aforementioned fair value adjustments, there were no other material fair value adjustments during fiscal   2017   and   2016  .

Other merchandise held for sale includes, among other items, serveware and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations.  
  As of   October 1, 2017  , we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling   $860 million   under fixed-price contracts and an estimated   $336 million   under price-to-be-fixed contracts. As of   October 1, 2017  ,   none   of our price-to-be-fixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base  C  coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to  fix  the base  C  coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base  C  coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote.

Note 6:    Equity and Cost Investments     (in millions) 

Equity Method Investments 
  As of   October 1, 2017  , we had a   50%   ownership interest in each of the following international equity method investees: President Starbucks Coffee (East China); Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd.; President Starbucks Coffee Corporation (Taiwan) Company Limited; and Tata Starbucks Limited (India). These international entities operate licensed Starbucks        retail stores. We further describe the pending transactions to acquire East China and to divest Taiwan in    Note 15   , Commitments and Contingencies.  
  We also license the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks-branded products to our   50%   owned joint venture, The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, which develops and distributes bottled Starbucks        beverages, including Frappuccino        coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot        espresso drinks, Starbucks Refreshers        beverages, and Starbucks        Iced Espresso Classics. 
  In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our   49%   ownership interest in our Spanish joint venture, Starbucks Coffee Espa a, S.L. ( Starbucks Spain ), to our joint venture partner, Sigla S.A. (Grupo Vips), for a total purchase price of   $30.2 million  . This transaction resulted in an   insignificant   pre-tax gain, which was included in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.  
  Our share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. Also included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross profit resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these related parties were   $187.3 million  ,   $164.2 million  , and   $153.4 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Related costs of sales were   $109.3 million  ,   $97.5 million  , and   $94.5 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , there were   $54.3 million   and   $55.7 million   of accounts receivable from equity investees, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to product sales and royalty revenues. 
  Cost Method Investments 
  As of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , we had   $23 million   invested in equity interests of entities that develop and operate Starbucks        licensed stores in several global markets. We have the ability to acquire additional interests in some of these cost method investees at certain intervals. Depending on our total percentage ownership interest and our ability to exercise significant influence over financial and operating policies, additional investments may require application of the equity method of accounting.

  During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, management finalized its long-term strategy for the Teavana reporting unit. The plan emphasizes sales of premium Teavana  tea products at Starbucks branded stores and, to a lesser extent, consumer product channels. The existing portfolio of Teavana-branded retail stores are expected to be closed over the next several quarters. This change in strategic direction triggered an impairment test first of the retail store assets and then an impairment test of the goodwill asset, which also coincided with our annual goodwill testing process. For goodwill, we utilized a combination of income and market approaches to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit. These approaches used primarily unobservable inputs, including discount, sales growth and royalty rates and valuation multiples of a selection of similar publicly traded companies, which are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. We then compared the implied fair value with the carrying value and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of   $69.3 million  , thus reducing goodwill of the Teavana reporting unit to   $398.3 million   as of   October 1, 2017  . The remaining intangible assets for the Teavana reporting unit of   $117.2 million  , consisting primarily of the indefinite-lived tradename and finite-lived tea recipes, were also tested, and no impairment losses were recorded. 
    
  The ongoing impact of the macro economic challenges we have experienced in our EMEA company-owned markets and the continued strength of the Swiss franc, when compared to the relatively inexpensive euro in surrounding countries, have posed strong headwinds to our Switzerland retail reporting unit.

calculation for our Switzerland retail business are not expected to fully recover the reporting unit s carrying value given the sustained nature of these and other external factors on consumer behavior and tourism. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of   $17.9 million   in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and, as of   October 1, 2017  , we had approximately   $37 million   of goodwill remaining on our condensed consolidated balance sheet associated with this reporting unit. 
  Finite-Lived Intangible Assets  

Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was   $57.5 million  ,   $57.3 million  , and   $50.0 million   during fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program 
  Our   $1.5 billion   unsecured, revolving credit facility with various banks, of which   $150 million   may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and is currently set to mature on   November 6, 2020  . Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional   $750 million  . Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard   Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit agreement. The current applicable margin is   0.565%   for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and   0.00%   (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses.   As of October 1, 2017, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.   No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of   October 1, 2017  . 
  Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of   $1 billion  , with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed   397 days   from the date of issue.

  Long-term Debt 
    
  In   March 2017  , we issued Japanese yen-denominated long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering. The   7  -year   0.372%   Senior Notes (the  2024 notes ) due   March 2024   were issued with a face value of    85 billion  , of which    81 billion   has been designated to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in Japan. Interest on the 2024 notes is payable semi-annually on   March 15   and   September 15   of each year, commencing on   September 15, 2017  . 
  In December 2016, we repaid the   $400 million   of   0.875%   Senior Notes (the  2016 notes ) at maturity. 
  In   May 2016  , we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of   $500 million   of 10-year   2.450%   Senior Notes (the  2026 notes ) due   June 2026  . Interest on the 2026 notes is payable semi-annually on   June 15   and   December 15   of each year, commencing on   December 15, 2016  . 
  In   February 2016  , we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of   $500 million   of 5-year   2.100%   Senior Notes (the  2021 notes ) due   February 2021  . In   May 2016  , we reopened this offering with the same terms and issued an additional   $250 million   of Senior Notes (collectively, the  2021 notes ) for an aggregate amount outstanding of   $750 million  . Interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually on   February 4   and   August 4   of each year, commencing on   August 4, 2016  . 
  In   July 2015  , we redeemed   $550 million   of   6.250%   Senior Notes (the  2017 notes ) originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The redemption resulted in a charge of   $61.1 million  , which is presented separately as loss on extinguishment of debt within other income and expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. This loss primarily relates to the optional redemption payment as outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as non-cash expenses related to the previously capitalized original issuance costs and accelerated amortization of the unamortized discount. In connection with the redemption, we also reclassified   $2.0 million   from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings related to remaining unrecognized losses from interest rate contracts entered into in conjunction with the 2017 notes and designated as cash flow hedges. 
  In   June 2015  , we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of   $500 million   of 7-year   2.700%   Senior Notes (the  2022 notes ) due   June 2022  , and   $350 million   of 30-year   4.300%   Senior Notes (the  2045 notes ) due   June 2045  . Interest on the 2022 and 2045 notes is payable semi-annually on   June 15   and   December 15   of each year, commencing on   December 15, 2015  .

We have subleases related to certain of our operating leases. During fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , we recognized sublease income of   $15.5 million  ,   $14.6 million  , and   $11.9 million  , respectively. Additionally, as of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , the gross carrying values of assets related to build-to-suit lease arrangements accounted for as financing leases were   $94.3 million   and   $92.7 million  , respectively, with associated accumulated depreciation of   $9.0 million   and   $6.2 million  , respectively. Lease exit costs associated with our restructuring efforts will be recognized concurrently with actual store closures. Total lease exit costs are expected to be approximately   $153.7 million   of which   $15.7 million   were recorded within restructuring and impairments on the consolidated statement of earnings in fiscal 2017.  
   
  Note 11:    Equity 
  In addition to   2.4 billion   shares of authorized common stock with   $0.001   par value per share, we have authorized   7.5 million   shares of preferred stock,   none   of which was outstanding at   October 1, 2017  . 
  We repurchased   37.5 million   shares of common stock at a total cost of   $2.1 billion  , and   34.9 million   shares at a total cost of $  2.0 billion   for the years ended   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , respectively. As of   October 1, 2017  ,   80.3 million   shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. 
  Comprehensive Income 
  Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during the period, except those resulting from transactions with our shareholders. Comprehensive income is comprised of net earnings and other comprehensive income.

Note 12:    Employee Stock and Benefit Plans 
  We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs ) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ). 
  As of   October 1, 2017  , there were   73.5 million   shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards and   13.3 million   shares available for issuance under our ESPP. 
  Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements   (in millions)  : 

Stock Option Plans 
  Stock options to purchase our common stock are granted at the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The majority of options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire   10 years   from the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest over   one   to   three years  . All outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options. 
  The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  : 

The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above, which is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding options, is before applicable income taxes and represents the amount optionees would have realized if all in-the-money options had been exercised on the last business day of the period indicated. 
  As of   October 1, 2017  , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested options was approximately   $38 million  , before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.7 years  . The total intrinsic value of options exercised was   $181 million  ,   $254 million  , and   $358 million   during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The total fair value of options vested was   $40 million  ,   $37 million  , and   $36 million   during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  RSUs 
  We have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and non-employee directors and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject solely to the employee s continuing employment or the non-employee director's continuing service. The majority of time-vested RSUs vest in two equal annual installments beginning a year from the grant date. Our performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals during the performance period and the grantee remains employed during the subsequent vesting period. The majority of performance-based RSUs vest in two equal annual installments beginning two years from the grant date. 
  RSU transactions for the year ended   October 1, 2017     (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts)  : 

For fiscal 2016 and 2015, the weighted average fair value per RSU granted was   $58.81   and   $38.56  , respectively. As of   October 1, 2017  , total unrecogniz  ed stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately     $75 million  , before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.0 years  . The total fair value of RSUs vested was   $182 million  ,   $169 million   and   $137 million   during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  ESPP 
  Our ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to   10%   of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of our common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is   95%   of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was   0.5 million   in fiscal   2017  .

Deferred Compensation Plan 
  We have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material. 
  Defined Contribution Plans 
  We maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. 
  Our matching contributions to all U.S. and non-U.S. plans were   $101.4 million  ,   $86.2 million   and   $70.9 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  Reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate with our effective income tax rate: 

U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately   $3.7 billion   of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity investees, including cumulative unrealized currency translation adjustments. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. If these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of

dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation, and the amount of liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. 
  Tax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that comprise significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities   (in millions): 

The valuation allowance as of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016   is primarily related to net operating losses and other deferred tax assets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries.  
  As of   October 1, 2017  , we had state net operating loss carryforwards of   $31.2 million   which will begin to expire in   fiscal 2024  , state tax credit carryforwards of   $18.0 million  , of which   $15.9 million   will begin to expire in fiscal 2024 and the remainder will begin to expire in fiscal 2018, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of   $262.2 million  , of which   $207.3 million   have an indefinite carryforward period and the remainder expire at various dates starting from fiscal 2018. 
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
  As of   October 1, 2017  , we had   $196.9 million   of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which   $139.5 million  , if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized an   expense   of   $5.2 million  , a   benefit   of   $3.6 million   and an   expense   of   $0.7 million   of interest and penalties in income tax expense, prior to the benefit of the federal tax deduction, for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , we had accrued interest and penalties of   $11.2 million   and   $7.7 million  , respectively, within our consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits   (in millions)  : 

We are currently under examination, or may be subject to examination, by various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions for fiscal years 2006 through 2016.     We are no longer subject to U.S. federal or state examination for years prior to fiscal year 2011, with the exception of   one   state. We are no longer subject to examination in any material international markets prior to 2006. 
  It is reasonably possible that a portion of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of fiscal 2018 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities. We estimate this range to be approximately   $42 million   to   $75 million  . 
   
  Note 14:    Earnings per Share 
  Calculation of net earnings per common share ( EPS )   basic and diluted   (in millions, except EPS)  : 

Potential dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options (both vested and non-vested) and unvested RSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such options  exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. We had   11.4 million   and   5.4 million   out-of-the-money stock options as of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , respectively. There were   no   out-of-the-money stock options as of   September 27, 2015  . 
   
  Note 15:    Commitments and Contingencies 
  Contractual Commitments  
  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we signed an agreement to acquire the remaining   50%   ownership of our East China joint venture from Uni-President Enterprises Corporation ( UPEC ) and President Chain Store Corporation ( PCSC ) for approximately   $1.3 billion   to unify our business operations across mainland China. The acquisition will convert these licensed stores to company-operated stores and is expected to close by early calendar year 2018, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Concurrently, with the purchase of our East China joint venture, UPEC and PCSC will assume 100% ownership of Starbucks operations in Taiwan by acquiring our   50%   interest in President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Limited for approximately   $175 million  . The sale is also expected to close by early calendar year 2018.

  Americas, CAP, and EMEA operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single-serve coffee products and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores.   Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our CAP and EMEA operations are still in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our Americas operations. The Americas, CAP and EMEA segments also include certain foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada, Japan and the U.K. 
  Channel Development operations sell a selection of packaged coffees and single-serve products, as well as a selection of premium Tazo        teas globally. Channel Development operations also produce and sell a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino        coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot        espresso drinks, Starbucks Refreshers        beverages, Teavana  tea beverages and chilled multi-serve beverages.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Starbucks Corporation 
  Seattle, Washington 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   October 1, 2017  . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries as of   October 1, 2017   and   October 2, 2016  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   October 1, 2017  , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of   October 1, 2017  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated   November 17, 2017   expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal   2017  , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (  October 1, 2017  ). 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 
  The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits    31.1    and    31.2   , respectively, to this 10-K. 
    
  Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. 
  Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework   (the  2013 Framework ), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   October 1, 2017  . 
  Our internal control over financial reporting as of   October 1, 2017   has been audited by Deloitte   Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Starbucks Corporation 
  Seattle, Washington 
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of   October 1, 2017  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   October 1, 2017  , based on the criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended   October 1, 2017  , of the Company and our report dated   November 17, 2017   expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

  STARBUCKS CORPORATION 
  GLOBAL KEY EMPLOYEE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT AGREEMENT 
  2005 LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
  STARBUCKS CORPORATION (the    Company   ) does hereby grant to the individual named below (the    Participant   ) an award (the    Award   ) for the number of restricted stock units (the    Restricted Stock Units   ) set forth below, effective on the Date of Grant set forth below. The Restricted Stock Units shall vest and become payable in shares of Common Stock (the    Shares   ) according to the vesting schedule set forth below subject to earlier expiration or termination of the Restricted Stock Units as provided in this Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, including any special terms and conditions applicable to the Participant s country contained in the Appendix A attached hereto (together with the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, this    Agreement   ). This Agreement shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ).  Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan.  
                 Participant: 
      
      Number of Units: 
      
      Date of Grant: 
      
      Vesting Schedule: 

1.  Vesting Schedule; Form and Timing of Payment of Vested Restricted Stock Units  .    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, a number of the Restricted Stock Units will vest as set forth above, subject to the Participant s continued Active Status through the applicable Vesting Date (except as provided in Sections 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 below). Any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid to the Participant solely in whole Shares (and not in cash, as the Plan permits) on, or within thirty (30) days after, the relevant Vesting Date on which the Restricted Stock Units vest in accordance with this Section 1 (or, if earlier, upon a vesting event contemplated under Section 3.2 or 3.3 below, as applicable), subject to any delayed payment required under Section 6 below.   
    
  2.  Dividend Equivalents  .    On each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Shares, an amount (the    Dividend Equivalent Amount   ) equal to the cash dividend that is paid on each Share, multiplied by the number of Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units and any Dividend Equivalent RSUs (as defined below) that remain unvested and outstanding as of the dividend payment date, shall be credited for the benefit of the Participant, and such credited amount shall be converted into an additional number of Restricted Stock Units (   Dividend Equivalent RSUs   ) determined by dividing the Dividend Equivalent Amount by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the dividend payment date, rounded up or down to the nearest whole number. Dividend Equivalent RSUs will be subject to the same conditions as the underlying Restricted Stock Units with respect to which the Dividend Equivalent RSUs were paid, including, without limitation, the vesting conditions and the provisions governing time and form of settlement applicable to the underlying Restricted Stock Units.  Unless expressly provided otherwise, as used elsewhere in this Agreement  Restricted Stock Units  shall include any Dividend Equivalent RSUs that have been credited to the Participant s account. 
    
  3.  Termination of Employment; Change of Control  . 
    
  3.1  Termination of Employment  .    Except as provided in Sections 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 below, any unvested Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement shall immediately terminate and be automatically forfeited by the Participant to the Company upon the termination of the Participant s Active Status with the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company for any reason (as further described in Section 8(l) below), including without limitation,  
  
   Page   1   of 19 
  Global Key Employee RSU Agreement 

voluntary termination by the Participant, or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. 
    
  3.2  Change of Control  .    Upon a Change of Control, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall accelerate, and the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested and payable to the extent and under the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan; provided that for purposes of this Section 3.2,    Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason    shall have the following meaning: 
     Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason    shall mean any voluntary termination by written resignation of the Active Status of a Participant after a Change of Control because of: (1) a material reduction in the Partner s authority, responsibilities or scope of employment; (2) an assignment of duties to the Partner materially inconsistent with the Partner s role at the Company (including its Subsidiaries and affiliates) prior to the Change of Control, (3) a material reduction in the Partner s base salary or total incentive compensation; (4) a material reduction in the Partner s benefits unless such reduction applies to all Partners of comparable rank; or (5) the relocation of the Partner s primary work location more than 50 miles from the Partner s primary work location prior to the Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall not be deemed to have Resigned for Good Reason unless the Participant, within one year after a Change of Control, (i) notifies the Company of the existence of the condition giving rise to a Resignation for Good Reason within 90 days of the initial existence of such condition, (ii) gives the Company at least 30 days following the date on which the Company receives such notice (and prior to termination) in which to remedy the condition, and (iii) if the Company does not remedy such condition within such 30-day period, actually terminates employment within 60 days after the expiration of such 30-day period (and before the Company remedies such condition). If the Company remedies such condition within such 30-day period (or at any time prior to the Participant s actual termination), then any Resignation for Good Reason by the Participant on account of such condition will not be a Resignation for Good Reason. 
  3.3  Retirement  .    If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Retirement, the Participant will continue to vest in all unvested Restricted Stock Units as if the Participant s Active Status had not terminated, subject to and conditioned upon compliance with the terms of Section 4 through each Vesting Date.    
    
  3.4  Disability or Death  .    If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Disability or death, all unvested Restricted Stock Units will vest in full as of the date of termination of Active Status due to Disability or death.   
    
  4.  Misconduct  .    As a condition to receiving and becoming eligible to vest in the Restricted Stock Units, the Participant hereby agrees not to engage in Misconduct.   
    
  5.  Clawback  .    If the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has engaged in Misconduct, the Participant agrees and covenants that (a) any unvested portion of the Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited as of the date the Company determines that the Participant has engaged in Misconduct (the    Determination Date    (b) if any part of the Restricted Stock Units vested and were settled prior to the Determination Date, upon the Company s demand, the Participant shall immediately deliver to the Company (i) the Shares that the Participant acquired upon settlement of such Restricted Stock Units and (ii) to the extent any such Shares were previously sold by the Participant, a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the Determination Date of the Shares contemplated to be returned to the Company under this clause; and (c) the foregoing remedies set forth in this Section 5. shall not be the Company s exclusive remedies, which shall include, among other remedies, injunctive relief and damages that may be available to the Company.  The Company reserves all other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. 
    
  6.  Code Section 409A  .    The provisions in this Section 6 shall apply if the Participant is subject to taxation in the United States. 
    
  6.1  To the extent the Restricted Stock Units constitute  nonqualified deferred compensation  that is subject to Code Section 409A, any Restricted Stock Units that are payable upon or with reference to the date that the Participant s Active Service terminates (i) shall not be paid unless the Participant experiences a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A and (ii) if the Participant is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Code Section 409A on the date of the Participant s separation from service, then the Restricted Stock Units shall be  
  
   Page   2   of 19 
  Global Key Employee RSU Agreement 

paid on the first business day of the seventh month following the Participant s separation from service, or, if earlier, on the date of the Participant s death, to the extent such delayed payment is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A. 
    
  6.2  This Award and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan are intended to qualify for an exemption from or comply with Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement and the Plan, the Company, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right, but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify this Agreement and/or the Plan so that the Restricted Stock Units granted to the Participant qualify for exemption from or comply with Code Section 409A; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations that the Restricted Stock Units shall be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Code Section 409A from applying to the Restricted Stock Units. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall provide a basis for any person to take action against the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company based on matters covered by Code Section 409A, including the tax treatment of any amount paid or Award made under this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall under any circumstances have any liability to any Participant or his or her estate or any other party for any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Code Section 409A for any amounts paid or payable under this Agreement.   
    
  7.  Responsibility for Taxes  .    Regardless of any action the Company or, if different, the Participant s employer (the    Employer   ) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant (   Tax-Related Items   ), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Shares in settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if the Participant is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
    
  Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or additional authorization by the Participant, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: 
           (a) 
    withholding from the Participant s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer; or 
              (b) 
    withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares issued in settlement of the vested Restricted Stock Units, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Participant s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent), to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions; or 
              (c) 
    withholding in whole Shares to be issued in settlement of the vested Restricted Stock Units based on the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the date the withholding obligation arises, in an amount equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or the Employer with respect to such Award, provided, however that if the Participant is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences,  
     
   Page   3   of 19 
  Global Key Employee RSU Agreement 

in which case, the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (a) and (b) above. 
  Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, to the extent authorized under the Plan, in which case the Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan. In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.   
  Finally, the Participant is required to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares. 
  8.  Nature of Grant  .    In accepting the grant of the Award, the Participant acknowledges, understands and agrees that:  
    
           (a) 
    the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;  
       
           (b) 
    the grant of the Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of restricted stock units or other awards, or benefits in lieu of restricted stock units, even if restricted stock units have been granted in the past;  
       
           (c)

           (d) 
    the Award and the Participant s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be interpreted as forming an employment or service relationship with the Company, the Employer or any other Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, the Employer or any other Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, as applicable, to terminate the Participant s employment or service relationship, if any;  
       
           (e)

           (i) 
    the future value of the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;  
       
           (j)

           (l)

           (m) 
    unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Restricted Stock Units and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock Units or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Common Stock; and  
       
           (n)

  9.  No Advice Regarding Grant  .    The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Participant s participation in the Plan, or the Participant s  
  
   Page   5   of 19 
  Global Key Employee RSU Agreement 

acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. The Participant should consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding the Participant s participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan. 
    
  10.  Data Privacy  .      The Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Participant s personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Restricted Stock Unit grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company, and its other Subsidiaries and affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant s participation in the Plan.   
    
  The Participant understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Participant, including, but not limited to, the Participant s name, home address and telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, social insurance number (to the extent permitted under applicable local law), passport or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to shares of stock or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant s favor (     Data     ), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.   
  The Participant understands that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC, or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. The recipients of Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and each recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participant s country. If the Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting the Participant s local partner resources representative. The Participant authorizes the Company, Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares received upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units. The Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Participant s participation in the Plan. If the Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant may, at any time, view Data, request information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, without cost, by contacting the Participant s local partner resources representative. Further, the Participant understands that the Participant is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If the Participant does not consent, or if the Participant later seeks to revoke the Participant s consent, the Participant s employment or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Participant s consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Restricted Stock Units or other equity awards to the Participant or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, the Participant understands that refusal or withdrawal of the Participant s consent may affect the Participant s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of the Participant s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local partner resources representative.

The Participant understands that the Company is under no obligation to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Further, the Participant agrees that the Company shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and this Agreement without the Participant s consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws applicable to issuance of Shares. 
    
  13.  Language  .    If the Participant has received this Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control. 
    
  14.  Electronic Delivery and Acceptance  .    The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.

  17.  No Rights as Shareholder  .    Except as otherwise provided in Section 2, the Participant will not have dividend, voting or any other rights as a shareholder of the Shares with respect to the Restricted Stock Units.  Upon payment of the vested Restricted Stock Units in Shares, the Participant will obtain full dividend, voting and other rights as a shareholder of the Company.   
    
  18.  Restrictions on Transfer  .    Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Award may not be sold, pledged (as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose), assigned, hypothecated, transferred, disposed of in exchange for consideration, made subject to attachment or similar proceedings, or otherwise disposed of under any circumstances, except that this Award may be transferred (i) by will or by laws of descent and distribution applicable to a deceased Participant or (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order.  
    
  19.  Appendix A  .    Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, the Award of Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A for the Participant s country. Moreover, if the Participant relocates to one of the countries included in Appendix A, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to the Participant, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix A constitutes part of this Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. 
    
  20.  Imposition of Other Requirements  .  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant s participation in the Plan, on the Restricted Stock Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings (as provided in Section 16 above) that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 
    
  21.  Waiver  .    If the Participant breaches or otherwise does not comply with any provision of this Agreement, but the Company does not act upon this breach or non-compliance and continues to comply with its obligations under this  
  
   Page   7   of 19 
  Global Key Employee RSU Agreement 

Agreement, this shall not mean that the Company waives any other provision of this Agreement or will otherwise permit any further breach of or non-compliance with any provision of this Agreement.   
    
  22.  Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws  .    The Participant acknowledges that, depending on the applicable jurisdiction, the Participant may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws, which may affect the Participant s ability to acquire or sell Shares or rights to Shares (  e.g.  , Restricted Stock Units) under the Plan during such times as the Participant is considered to have  inside information  regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdiction). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company. The Participant acknowledges that it is the Participant s responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and the Participant should consult with the Participant s own personal legal and financial advisors on this matter before taking any action related to the Plan. 
    
  23.  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting; Exchange Controls  .  The Participant s country may have certain foreign asset and/or account reporting requirements and/or exchange controls which may affect the Participant s ability to acquire or hold Shares under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends received or sale proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) in a brokerage or bank account outside the Participant s country. The Participant may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in his or her country. The Participant also may be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan to his or her country through a designated bank or broker and/or within a certain time after receipt.  The Participant acknowledges that it is his or her responsibility to be compliant with such regulations, and the Participant should consult his or her personal legal advisor for any details. 
    
  Finally, the Company hereby strongly recommends that the Participant seek the advice of a personal tax and/or legal advisor to obtain specific information concerning the tax and other legal consequences associated with the Restricted Stock Units.

  GLOBAL KEY EMPLOYEE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT AGREEMENT 
  2005 LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
  Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Appendix A but defined in the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, the Plan or any applicable country-specific sub-plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan, any applicable country-specific sub-plan and/or the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement (the    Key Employee RSU Agreement   ). 
    
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
    
  This Appendix A, which is part of the Key Employee RSU Agreement, includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Restricted Stock Units granted to the Participant under the Plan and that will apply to the Participant if he or she is in one of the countries listed below. 
    
  If the Participant is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to what extent the additional terms and conditions included herein will apply to the Participant under these circumstances. 
    
  NOTIFICATIONS 
    
  This Appendix A also includes information regarding exchange control and certain other issues of which the Participant should be aware with respect to his or her participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of August 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Participant not rely on the information in this Appendix A as the only source of information relating to the consequences of his or her participation in the Plan because such information may be outdated when the Restricted Stock Units vest and/or when the Participant sells any Shares acquired at vesting of the Restricted Stock Units. 
    
  In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to the Participant s particular situation. As a result, the Company is not in a position to assure the Participant of any particular result. The Participant, therefore, should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country may apply to his or her situation. 
    
  Finally, if the Participant is a citizen or resident or a country other than that in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the information contained herein may not be applicable in the same manner to the Participant. 
    
  EUROPEAN UNION

  Retirement.   The Company reserves the right not to apply Section 3.3 of the Key Employee RSU Agreement, in which case, Sections 1 and 3.1 of the Key Employee RSU Agreement shall be deemed amended, accordingly, such that no references to continued vesting after a termination due to Retirement shall apply to the Restricted Stock Units.  Alternatively, provided the Participant is not subject to taxation in the United States, the Company reserves the right to accelerate vesting of the Restricted Stock Units such that the Award would become fully vested as of the date Active Status terminates due to Retirement and the Award would be payable in accordance with Section 1 of the Key Employee RSU Agreement to the extent that it has not previously been forfeited.

  Compliance with Law  .

Further, the Employer is under no obligation to seek or obtain the approval of its shareholders in general meeting for the purpose of overcoming any such limitation or restriction.

  CANADA 
    
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
    
  Termination of Active Status.    Notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 2(a) of the Plan and consistent with Section 14(b) of the Plan, the Participant s Active Status shall be considered terminated as of the date that is the earlier of (a) the date that the Participant receives notice of termination of employment; (b) the date the Participant terminates employment; or (c) the date the Participant is no longer actively employed by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under local law (including, but not limited to statutory law, regulatory law and/or common law); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant s Active Status shall be considered terminated for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units (including when the Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence). 
    
  The following provisions apply if the Participant is a resident of Quebec: 
    
  Language Consent.    The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that this Agreement, as well as all documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English. 
    
  Les parties reconnaissent avoir expressement souhait  que cette Convention, ainsi que tous les documents, avis et proc dures judiciaries,  xecut s, donn s ou intent s en vertu de, ou li , directement ou indirectement   la pr sente convention, soient r dig s en langue anglaise. 
    
  Data Privacy Notice and Consent.    The following provision supplements the Data Privacy section of the Key Employee RSU Agreement: 
    
  The Participant hereby authorizes the Company and the Company s representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all personnel (professional or not) involved in the administration and operation of the Plan. The Participant further authorizes the Company, any Subsidiary and affiliate and the Employer to disclose and discuss  
  
   Page   12   of 19

the Participant s participation in the Plan with their advisors. The Participant further authorizes the Company, any Subsidiary and affiliate and the Employer to record such information and to keep it in the Participant s employee file. 
    
  NOTIFICATIONS 
    
  Securities Law Information  .      The Participant is permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided that the resale of such Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (  i.e  ., the NASDAQ Global Select Market). 
    
  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information.    Foreign specified property, including shares of stock (  i.e.  , Shares), options to purchase Shares and other rights to receive Shares (  e.g.  , Restricted Stock Units) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of his or her foreign specified property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year. Thus, Restricted Stock Units likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign specified property the Participant holds. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (   ACB   ) of the Shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if the Participant owns other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares. The Participant should consult with a personal tax advisor to ensure compliance with the applicable reporting obligations. 
    
  CHINA 
    
  The following applies only to Participants who are subject to exchange control restrictions in China, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 
    
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
    
  Termination of Employment; Change of Control.    The following provision supplements the Termination of Employment; Change of Control section of the Key Employee RSU Agreement: 
    
  Due to legal restrictions in China, the Participant agrees that the Company reserves the right to require the automatic sale of any Shares acquired at vesting of the Restricted Stock Units upon the termination of the Participant s Active Status with the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company for any reason, including without limitation, voluntary termination by the Participant, termination because of the Participant s Retirement, Disability or death or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. The Participant hereby authorizes the sale of all Shares issued to him or her as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable termination of Active Status and pursuant to this authorization.  The Participant further agrees that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares and the Participant expressly authorizes the Company s designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares.  The Participant acknowledges that the Company s designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price.  Upon the sale of Shares, the Participant will receive the sale proceeds less any amounts necessary to satisfy Tax-Related Items and applicable transaction fees or commissions. Due to currency exchange conversion rate fluctuation between the applicable vesting date of the Restricted Stock Units and (if later) the date on which the Shares are sold, the amount of sale proceeds may be more or less than the fair market value of the Shares on the applicable vesting date (which is the relevant amount for purposes of calculating amounts necessary to satisfy applicable Tax-Related Items). 
    
  Furthermore, the Company reserves the right not to apply Section 3.3 of the Key Employee RSU Agreement, in which case, Sections 1 and 3.1 of the Key Employee RSU Agreement shall be deemed amended, accordingly, such that no references to continued vesting after a termination due to Retirement shall apply to the Restricted Stock Units.  Alternatively, provided the Participant is not subject to taxation in the United States, the Company reserves the right to accelerate vesting of the Restricted Stock Units such that the Award would become fully vested as of the date Active Status terminates due to Retirement and the Award would be payable in accordance with Section 1 of the Key Employee RSU Agreement to the extent that it has not previously been forfeited. 

Page   13   of 19 
  Global Key Employee RSU Agreement 

Exchange Control Restriction.    Due to exchange control laws and regulations in China, the Participant will be required immediately to repatriate to China the cash proceeds from the sale of Shares and any cash dividends paid on such Shares. The Participant further understands that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effectuated through a special exchange control account established by the Company or a Subsidiary expressly for this purpose. By accepting the Restricted Stock Units, the Participant agrees that any cash proceeds from the sale of Shares or the receipt of any dividends may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to the Participant. The proceeds may be paid to the Participant in U.S. dollars or in local currency at the Company s discretion. If the proceeds are paid in U.S. dollars, the Participant understands that he or she will be required to open a U.S. dollar bank account in China and provide the bank account details to the Company or the Employer.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  Labor Law Acknowledgement.   The following provision supplements the Nature of Grant section of the Key Employee RSU Agreement: 
  The Participant acknowledges that pursuant to Article 128 of the Colombian Labor Code, the Plan, the Restricted Stock Units and any income realized under the Plan do not constitute a component of the Participant s  salary  for any legal purpose.

Upon the subsequent sale or other disposition of any previously-registered investments, the Participant may choose to keep the resulting proceeds abroad, or to repatriate them to Colombia. If the Participant chooses to repatriate funds to Colombia and has not registered the investment with   Banco de la Rep blica,   a Form No. 5 must be filed with   Banco de la Rep blica   upon conversion of funds into local currency, which should be duly completed to reflect the nature of the transaction. If the investment was previously registered with   Banco de la Rep blica,   the Participant will need to file Form No. 4 upon conversion of funds into local currency, which should be

An annual informative return must be filed with the Colombian Tax Office detailing any assets held abroad (including Shares acquired under the Plan).

ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND CONSENT 
       
  1.  Termination of Employment; Change of Control  .   
    
  1.1  Termination of Employment  .   Except as provided in Section 1.2 or 1.3 below, any unvested Options subject to this Agreement shall immediately terminate and be automatically forfeited by the Optionee to the Company upon the termination of the Optionee s Active Status with the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company for any reason (as further described in Section 5(n) below), including without limitation, voluntary termination by the Optionee, or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. 
  1.2        Change of Control  . Upon a Change of Control, the vesting of the Options shall accelerate, and the Options shall become fully vested and exercisable to the extent and under the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan; provided, that for purposes of this Section,    Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason    shall have the following meaning:  
     Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason    shall mean any voluntary termination by written resignation of the Active Status of an Optionee after a Change of Control because of: (1) a material reduction in the Partner s authority, responsibilities or scope of employment; (2) an assignment of duties to the Partner materially inconsistent with the Partner s role at the Company (including its Subsidiaries and affiliates) prior to the Change of Control, (3) a material reduction in the Partner s base salary or total incentive compensation; (4) a material reduction in the Partner s benefits unless such reduction applies to all Partners of comparable rank; or (5) the relocation of the Partner s primary work location more than 50 miles from the Partner s primary work location prior to the Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Optionee shall not be deemed  
  
   Page   1   of 16 
  Global Key Employee Option Agreement 

to have Resigned for Good Reason unless the Optionee, within one year after a Change of Control, (i) notifies the Company of the existence of the condition giving rise to a Resignation for Good Reason within 90 days of the initial existence of such condition, (ii) gives the Company at least 30 days following the date on which the Company receives such notice (and prior to termination) in which to remedy the condition, and (iii) if the Company does not remedy such condition within such 30-day period, actually terminates employment within 60 days after the expiration of such 30-day period (and before the Company remedies such condition). If the Company remedies such condition within such 30-day period (or at any time prior to the Optionee s actual termination), then any Resignation for Good Reason by the Optionee on account of such condition will not be a Resignation for Good Reason.    
  1.3        Death, Disability or Retirement  .    If the Optionee s Active Status terminates due to death, Disability or Retirement, any unvested Options shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable as of the date of termination of Active Status due to death, Disability or Retirement.   
    
  2.  Misconduct  .    As a condition to receiving and becoming eligible to vest and exercise the Options, the Optionee hereby agrees not to engage in Misconduct.   
    
  3.  Clawback  .    If the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the Optionee has engaged in Misconduct, the Optionee agrees and covenants that (a) any unexercised portion of the Options shall be immediately forfeited as of the date the Company determines that the Optionee has engaged in Misconduct (the    Determination Date    (b) if any part of the Options were exercised prior to the Determination Date, upon the Company s demand, the Optionee shall immediately deliver to the Company (i) the Shares that the Optionee acquired upon exercise of such Options and (ii) to the extent any such Shares were previously sold by the Optionee, a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the Determination Date of the Shares contemplated to be returned to the Company under this clause; and (c) the foregoing remedies set forth in this Section 3 shall not be the Company s exclusive remedies, which shall include, among other remedies, injunctive relief and damages that may be available to the Company.  The Company reserves all other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. 
    
  4.  Responsibility for Taxes  .    Regardless of any action the Company or, if different, the Optionee s employer (the    Employer   ) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Optionee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Optionee (   Tax-Related Items   ), the Optionee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains his or her responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Optionee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Options, including but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Options, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Options to reduce or eliminate the Optionee s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if the Optionee is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, he or she acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
       
  Prior to exercise of the Options or any other relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Optionee must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, in their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:  
    
           (a) 
    withholding from the Optionee s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Optionee by the Company and/or the Employer; or 
       
           (b) 
    withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon exercise of the Options, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Optionee s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent), to the extent and in the manner permitted by  
     
   Page   2   of 16 
  Global Key Employee Option Agreement 

all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions; or 
    
           (c) 
    withholding in whole Shares to be issued at exercise of the Options based on the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the date the withholding obligation arises, in an amount equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or the Employer with respect to such Options. 
       
  Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, to the extent authorized under the Plan, in which case the Optionee may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Optionee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the exercised Options, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the Optionee s participation in the Plan. In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Optionee.   
       
  Finally, the Optionee is required to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of his or her participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Optionee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. The Optionee shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares. 
    
  5.  Nature of Grant  .    In accepting the grant of the Options, the Optionee acknowledges, understands and agrees that: 
           (a) 
    the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan; 
       
           (b) 
    the grant of the Options is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of options or other awards, or benefits in lieu of options, even if options have been granted in the past; 
       
           (c) 
    all decisions with respect to future option or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;  
       
           (d) 
    the Optionee s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be interpreted as forming an employment or service relationship with the Company, the Employer or any other Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, the Employer or any other Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, as applicable, to terminate his or her employment or service relationship, if any;  
       
           (e) 
    the Optionee is voluntarily participating in the Plan;  
       
           (f) 
    the Options and the Shares subject to the Options, and the income from and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; 
       
           (g) 
    the Options and the Shares subject to the Options, and the income from and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for purposes of calculating any severance,

  7.  No Advice Regarding Grant  .    The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Optionee s participation in the Plan, or the Optionee s acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. The Optionee should consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding his or her participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan. 
    
  8.  Data Privacy  .  The Optionee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of his or her personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Option grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company, and its other Subsidiaries and affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Optionee s participation in the Plan. 
    
  The Optionee understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Optionee, including, but not limited to, the Optionee s name, home address and telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, social insurance number (to the extent permitted under applicable local law) passport or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Options or any other entitlement to shares of stock or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Optionee s favor (   Data   ), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.   
    
  The Optionee understands that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC, or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. The recipients of Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and each recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Optionee s country. If the Optionee resides outside the United States, the Optionee may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting his or her local partner resources representative. The Optionee authorizes the Company, Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing his or her participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom the Optionee may elect to deposit any Shares received upon exercise of the Options.

Further, the Optionee understands that he or she is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If the Optionee does not consent, or if the Optionee later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her employment or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Optionee s consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Options or other equity awards to the Optionee or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, the Optionee understands that refusal or withdrawal of the Optionee s consent may affect the Optionee s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of the Optionee s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Optionee understands that he or she may contact his or her local partner resources representative.

  Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Appendix A but defined in the Global Key Employee Stock Option Grant Agreement, the Plan or any applicable country-specific sub-plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan, any applicable country-specific sub-plan and/or the Global Key Employee Stock Option Grant Agreement (the    Key Employee Option Agreement   ). 
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  This Appendix A, which is part of the Key Employee Option Agreement, includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Options to purchase Shares under the Plan and that will apply to the Optionee if he or she is in one of the countries listed below. 
  If the Optionee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to what extent the additional terms and conditions included herein will apply to the Optionee under these circumstances. 
  NOTIFICATIONS 
  This Appendix A also includes information regarding exchange control and certain other issues of which the Optionee should be aware with respect to his or her participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of August 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Optionee not rely on the information in this Appendix A as the only source of information relating to the consequences of his or her participation in the Plan because such information may be outdated when the Optionee exercises the Options and/or sells any Shares acquired at exercise. 
  In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to the Optionee s particular situation. As a result, the Company is not in a position to assure the Optionee of any particular result. The Optionee therefore should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country may apply to the Optionee s situation. 
  Finally, if the Optionee is a citizen or resident or a country other than that in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the information contained herein may not be applicable in the same manner to the Optionee.

Page   11   of 16 
  Global Key Employee Option Agreement 

NOTIFICATIONS 
  Securities Law Information  .      The Optionee is permitted to sell Shares acquired through the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided that the resale of such Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (  i.e  ., the NASDAQ Global Select Market).   
  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information.    Foreign specified property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares), options to purchase shares (i.e., Options) and other rights to receive shares (e.g., restricted stock units) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement) if the total cost of his or her foreign specified property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year. Thus, the Options must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because other foreign specified property the Optionee holds. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (   ACB   ) of the shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if the Optionee owns other Shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares. The Optionee should consult with his or her personal tax advisor to ensure compliance with the applicable reporting obligations. 
  CHINA 
  The following applies only if the Optionee is subject to exchange control restrictions in China, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  Cashless Exercise Restriction.    Notwithstanding Section 7(b) of the Plan, due to legal restrictions in China, the Optionee will be required to pay the Exercise Price by a cashless exercise through a licensed securities broker acceptable to the Company, such that all Shares subject to the exercised Options will be sold immediately upon exercise and the proceeds of sale, less the Exercise Price, any Tax-Related Items and broker s fees or commissions, will be remitted to the Optionee in accordance with any applicable exchange control laws and regulations. The Company reserves the right to provide the Optionee with additional methods of exercise depending on the development of local exchange control law. 
  Due to fluctuations in the trading price of the Company s Common Stock and/or the U.S. dollar/RMB currency exchange rate between the exercise/sale date and (if later) when the sale proceeds can be converted into local currency, the sale proceeds that the Optionee receives may be more or less than the fair market value of the Shares on the exercise/sale date minus the Exercise Price (which is the amount relevant to determining the Optionee s tax liability). 
  Termination of Employment.    Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan, due to legal restrictions in China, the Optionee agrees that the Optionee may be required to exercise the Option within a certain period of time after termination of the Optionee s Active Status for any reason, including without limitation, the Optionee s voluntary termination, termination because of Retirement, Disability or death or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. The Optionee hereby authorizes the Company or the Company s designated broker to effect the exercise on the Optionee s behalf at the end of the period. The Optionee acknowledges that the Company or the Company s designated broker is under no obligation to effect the exercise and immediate sale of the Shares subject to the exercised Option at any particular price.  Upon the exercise, the Optionee will receive the sale proceeds less any amounts necessary to satisfy Tax-Related Items and applicable transaction fees or commissions.   
  Exchange Control Restriction.    Due to exchange control laws and regulations in China, the Optionee will be required immediately to repatriate to China the cash proceeds from the sale of Shares. The Optionee further understands that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effectuated through a special exchange control account established by the Company or a Subsidiary expressly for this purpose. By accepting the Options, the Optionee agrees that any cash proceeds from the sale of Shares may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to the Optionee. The proceeds may be paid to the Optionee in U.S. dollars or in local currency at the Company s discretion.  If the proceeds are paid in U.S. dollars, the Optionee understands that he or she will be required to open a U.S. dollar bank account in China and provide the bank account details to the Company or the Employer. The Optionee  
  
   Page   12   of 16 
  Global Key Employee Option Agreement 

acknowledges that, if the cash proceeds are paid in local currency, the Company is under no obligation to secure any particular currency exchange conversion rate. Furthermore, compliance with local exchange control laws and regulations may delay the conversion of cash proceeds into local currency. The Optionee agrees that, if the conversion of the cash proceeds into local currency is delayed, he or she shall bear the risk of any currency exchange conversion rate fluctuation between the date on which the Shares issued at exercise of the Options are sold and the date of conversion of the cash proceeds into local currency. The Optionee further agrees to comply with any other requirements that the Company may impose in the future in order to facilitate compliance with exchange control requirements in China. 
  NOTIFICATIONS 
  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information  .  The Optionee may be required to report to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange all details of his or her foreign financial assets and liabilities, as well as details of any economic transactions conducted with non-China residents. Under these rules, the Optionee may be subject to reporting obligations for the Options, Shares acquired under the Plan and Plan-related transactions. The Optionee should consult with his or her personal tax advisor in this regard. 
  COLOMBIA 
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  Labor Law Acknowledgement.    The following provision supplements Section 5 of the Key Employee Option Agreement: 
  The Optionee acknowledges that pursuant to Article 128 of the Colombian Labor Code, the Plan, the Options and any income realized under the Plan do not constitute a component of the Optionee s  salary  for any legal purpose. Therefore, they will not be included and/or considered for purposes of calculating any and all labor benefits, such as legal/fringe benefits, vacations, indemnities, payroll taxes, social insurance contributions and/or any other labor-related amount which may be payable. 
  NOTIFICATIONS 
  Securities Law Information.    The Shares are not and will not be registered with the Colombian registry of publicly traded securities (  Registro Nacional de Valores y Emisores  ) and therefore the Shares may not be offered to the public in Colombia. Nothing in the Agreement should be construed as making a public offer of securities in Colombia. 
  Exchange Control Information.    If the Optionee holds investments outside Colombia (including Shares the Optionee acquires under the Plan) and the aggregate value of such investments is US$500,000 or more as of December 31 of any year, the Optionee will be required to register such investments with the Central Bank (  Banco de la Rep blica  ) as foreign investments held abroad. Upon the subsequent sale or other disposition of any previously-registered investments, the Optionee may choose to keep the resulting proceeds abroad, or to repatriate them to Colombia. If the Optionee chooses to repatriate funds to Colombia and has not registered the investment with   Banco de la Rep blica  , a Form No. 5 must be filed with   Banco de la Rep blica   upon conversion of funds into local currency, which should be duly completed to reflect the nature of the transaction. If the investment was previously registered with   Banco de la Rep blica  , the Optionee will need to file Form No. 4 upon conversion of funds into local currency, which should be duly completed to reflect the nature of the transaction. If Shares are sold immediately upon receipt, no registration is required because no  Shares are held abroad. It is the Optionee s responsibility to comply with Colombian exchange control requirements. 
  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information  .  An annual informative return must be filed with the Colombian Tax Office detailing any assets held abroad (including Shares acquired under the Plan).  If the individual value of any of these assets exceeds a certain threshold, each asset must be described in detail, including the jurisdiction in which it is located, its nature and its value.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  Responsibility for Taxes.    The following provision supplements Section 4 of the Key Employee Option Agreement: 
  Without limitation to Section 4 of the Key Employee Option Agreement, the Optionee agrees that the Optionee is liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenant to pay all such Tax-Related Items as and when requested by the Company or the Employer or by Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs (   HMRC   ) (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority).  Optionee also agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company and the Employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are required to pay or withhold on the Optionee s behalf or have paid or will pay to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority) on the Optionee s behalf. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee is an executive officer or director of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act ), the Optionee acknowledges that he or she may not be able to indemnify the Company or the Employer for the amount of any income tax not collected from or paid by the Optinee, as it may be considered a loan.  In this case, the amount of any income tax not collected within ninety (90) days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Item(s) occurs may constitute a benefit to the Optionee on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions (   NICs   ) may be payable.  The Optionee understands that he or she will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for paying to the Company and/or the Employer (as appropriate) the amount of any NICs due on this additional benefit, which may also be recovered from the Optionee at any time by any of the means referred to in Section 4 of the Key Employee Option Agreement.

  STARBUCKS CORPORATION 
  GLOBAL KEY EMPLOYEE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT AGREEMENT 
  2005 LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
  (PERFORMANCE-BASED) 
    
  STARBUCKS CORPORATION (the    Company   ) does hereby grant to the individual named below (the    Participant   ) an award (the    Award   ) of performance restricted stock units (the    Performance RSUs   ) in a target amount as set forth below (   Target RSUs   ), effective on the Date of Grant set forth below. The Performance RSUs granted under this Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, including any special terms and conditions applicable to the Participant s country contained in Appendix A attached hereto (together with the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, this    Agreement   ) are intended to qualify as  performance-based compensation  as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code. The Performance RSUs granted under this Agreement shall, subject to the attainment of certain performance goals set forth below (the    Performance Goals   ), relating to the Performance Criteria specified in the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, vest and become payable in shares of Common Stock (the    Shares   ), subject to earlier expiration or termination of the Performance RSUs as provided in this Agreement. The Performance RSUs and the terms of this Agreement, including the Appendices, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ).  Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan.  
    
                 Partner Name: 
      
      Target Restricted Stock Units: 
      
      Date of Grant: 
      
      Performance Period: 

1.  Vesting Schedule  . The number of Performance RSUs granted under the Award that actually vest and that will be settled shall be determined pursuant to a two-step process: (i) first the maximum number of Performance RSUs that are eligible to vest shall be calculated as provided under Section 1.1 hereof on the basis of the level at which the Performance Goal specified on attached Schedule I is actually attained and (ii) then the maximum number of Performance RSUs calculated under clause (i) that will actually vest shall be determined on the basis of the Participant s completion of the requirements set forth in Section 1.2 hereof. 
  1.1        Performance Goal Requirements  .  The attached Schedule I specifies the Performance Goals required to be attained during the Performance Period in order for the Performance RSUs to become eligible to vest. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the completion of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion determine and certify in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code the extent, if any, to which the Performance Goal has been satisfied. On the basis of that certified level of attainment, the Target RSUs will be multiplied by the applicable percentage determined in accordance with the percentile matrix set forth in Schedule I. The number of Performance RSUs resulting from such calculation shall constitute the maximum number of Performance RSUs in which the Participant may vest under this Award (the    Earned     Performance RSUs   ). 
  1.2        Active Status Vesting  .  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Award, a number of Earned Performance RSUs will vest as detailed in the attached Schedule II of this Agreement, subject to the Participant s continued Active Status through the applicable vesting date.  
  2.  Dividend Equivalents  .    On each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Shares during the Performance Period, an amount (the    Dividend Equivalent Amount   ) equal to the cash dividend that is paid on each Share, multiplied by the number of Shares subject to the Target RSUs and any Dividend Equivalent RSUs (as defined below) that remain unvested and outstanding as of the dividend payment date, shall be credited for the benefit of the Participant, and such  
  
   Page   1   of 18 
  Global Key Employee Performance RSU Agreement 

credited amount shall be converted into an additional number of Performance RSUs (   Dividend Equivalent RSUs   ) determined by dividing the Dividend Equivalent Amount by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the dividend payment date, rounded up or down to the nearest whole number. At the end of the Performance Period, the number of Dividend Equivalent RSUs will be adjusted to reflect the number of Dividend Equivalent RSUs that would have been credited to the Participant as of the Date of Grant if such calculations had been based on the number of Earned Performance RSUs (such adjusted number, the    Earned Dividend Equivalent RSUs   ).  During the period beginning immediately following the last day of the Performance Period and ending on the date the Performance RSUs granted hereunder are paid pursuant to Section 3 below, Dividend Equivalent RSUs will accrue on any Earned Performance RSUs and any Earned Dividend Equivalent RSUs.  Dividend Equivalent RSUs will be subject to the same conditions as the underlying Performance RSUs with respect to which Dividend Equivalent RSUs were paid, including, without limitation, the vesting conditions and the provisions governing time and form of settlement applicable to the underlying Performance RSUs.  Unless expressly provided otherwise, as used elsewhere in this Agreement,  Performance RSUs  shall include any Dividend Equivalent RSUs that have been credited to the Participant s account.   
  3.  Form and Timing of Payment of Vested Performance RSUs  .     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, any Performance RSUs that vest will be paid to the Participant solely in whole Shares (and not in cash, as the Plan permits), on, or soon as practicable after, the date the Performance RSUs vest in accordance with Section 1.2 hereof (or, if earlier, upon a vesting event contemplated in Section 4.2 or 4.3 below), but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and one-half months following the end of (i) the Participant s tax year that includes the date the Performance RSUs vest or (ii) the Company s tax year that includes the date the Performance RSUs vest.   
  4.  Termination of Employment; Change of Control  . 
  4.1        Termination of Employment  .    Except as provided in Section 4.2 or 4.3 below, any unvested Performance RSUs subject to this Agreement shall immediately terminate and be automatically forfeited by the Participant to the Company upon the termination of the Participant s Active Status with the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company for any reason (as further described in Section 9(l) below), including without limitation, voluntary termination by the Participant, termination because of the Participant s Retirement, or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. 
  4.2        Change of Control  .    Upon a Change of Control, the vesting of the Performance RSUs shall accelerate, and the Performance RSUs shall become fully vested and payable to the extent and under the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan; provided that, for purposes of this Section 4.2,  Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason  shall have the following meaning: 
     Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason    shall mean any voluntary termination by written resignation of the Active Status of a Participant after a Change of Control because of: (1) a material reduction in the Partner s authority, responsibilities or scope of employment; (2) an assignment of duties to the Partner materially inconsistent with the Partner s role at the Company (including its Subsidiaries and affiliates) prior to the Change of Control, (3) a material reduction in the Partner s base salary or total incentive compensation; (4) a material reduction in the Partner s benefits unless such reduction applies to all Partners of comparable rank; or (5) the relocation of the Partner s primary work location more than 50 miles from the Partner s primary work location prior to the Change of Control.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall not be deemed to have Resigned for Good Reason unless the Participant, within one year after a Change of Control, (i) notifies the Company of the existence of the condition giving rise to a Resignation for Good Reason within 90 days of the initial existence of such condition, (ii) gives the Company at least 30 days following the date on which the Company receives such notice (and prior to termination) in which to remedy the condition, and (iii) if the Company does not remedy such condition within such 30-day period, actually terminates employment within 60 days after the expiration of such 30-day period (and before the Company remedies such condition).  If the Company remedies such condition within such 30-day period (or at any time prior to the Participant s actual termination), then any Resignation for Good Reason by the Participant on account of such condition will not be a Resignation for Good Reason.

  Global Key Employee Performance RSU Agreement 

4.3        Death or Disability  .   If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Disability or death on or prior to the last day of the Performance Period, a number of Performance RSUs equal to the Target RSUs will vest in full as of the date of termination of Active Status due to Disability or death.  If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Disability or death following the last day of the Performance Period, a number of Performance RSUs equal to the Earned Performance RSUs will vest in full as of the date of termination of Active Status due to Disability or death.    
  5.  Misconduct  .    As a condition to receiving and becoming eligible to vest in the Performance RSUs, the Participant hereby agrees not to engage in Misconduct.   
  6.  Clawback  .    If the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has engaged in Misconduct, the Participant agrees and covenants that (a) any unvested portion of the Performance RSUs shall be immediately forfeited as of the date the Company determines that the Participant has engaged in Misconduct (the    Determination Date    (b) if any part of the Performance RSUs vested and were settled prior to the Determination Date, upon the Company s demand, the Participant shall immediately deliver to the Company (i) the Shares that the Participant acquired upon settlement of such Performance RSUs, and (ii) to the extent any of such Shares were previously sold by the Participant, a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the Determination Date of the Shares contemplated to be returned to the Company under this clause; and (c) the foregoing remedies set forth in this Section 6 shall not be the Company s exclusive remedies, which shall include, among other remedies, injunctive relief and damages that may be available to the Company.  The Company reserves all other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. 
  7.  Code Section 409A  .    This Award and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan are intended to qualify for an exemption from Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement and the Plan, the Company, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right, but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify this Agreement and/or the Plan so that the Performance RSUs granted to the Participant qualify for exemption from or comply with Code Section 409A; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations that the Performance RSUs shall be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Code Section 409A from applying to the Performance RSUs. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall provide a basis for any person to take action against the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company based on matters covered by Code Section 409A, including the tax treatment of any amount paid or Award made under this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall under any circumstances have any liability to any Participant or his or her estate or any other party for any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Code Section 409A for any amounts paid or payable under this Agreement. 
  8.  Responsibility for Taxes  .    Regardless of any action the Company or, if different, the Participant s employer (the    Employer   ) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant (   Tax-Related Items   ), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance RSUs, including, but not limited to the grant of the Performance RSUs, the vesting or settlement of the Performance RSUs, the issuance of Shares in settlement of the Performance RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if the Participant is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  
  Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or additional authorization by the Participant, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: 
  
   Page   3   of 18 
  Global Key Employee Performance RSU Agreement 

(a) 
    withholding from the Participant s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer; or 
              (b) 
    withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares issued in settlement of the vested Performance RSUs, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Participant s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent), to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions; or 
              (c) 
    withholding in whole Shares to be issued in settlement of the vested Performance RSUs based on the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the date the withholding obligation arises in an amount equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or the Employer with respect to such Award, provided, however that if the Participant is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case, the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (a) and (b) above. 
     Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, to the extent authorized under the Plan, in which case the Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares underlying the vested Performance RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan. In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.   
  Finally, the Participant is required to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares. 
  9.  Nature of Grant  .    In accepting the grant of the Award, the Participant acknowledges, understands and agrees that:  
           (a) 
    the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time; to the extent permitted by the Plan; 
              (b) 
    the grant of the Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of restricted stock units or other awards, or benefits in lieu of the Performance RSUs, even if restricted stock units have been granted in the past;  
              (c) 
    all decisions with respect to future restricted stock units or other awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;

              (h) 
    unless otherwise agreed with the Company. the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units, and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service that the Participant may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; 
              (i)

              (j) 
    after termination of the Participant s Active Status, the Participant is no longer eligible to receive any new restricted stock units under the Plan; 
              (k)

              (l) 
    for purposes of the Performance RSUs, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, the Participant s Active Status will be considered terminated as of the date the Participant is no longer actively providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of the Participant s employment or service contract, if any), and unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Plan, the Participant s right to vest in the Performance RSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (  e.g.  , the Participant s period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of  garden leave  or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of the Participant s employment or service contract, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant s Active Status for purposes of the Award is terminated (including whether the Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);  
              (m) 
    unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Performance RSUs and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Performance RSUs or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Common Stock; and

  The Participant understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Participant, including, but not limited to, the Participant s name, home address and telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, social insurance number (to the extent permitted under applicable local law), passport or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock or equivalent benefits awarded, cancelled, purchased, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant s favor (   Data   ), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.   
  The Participant understands that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC, or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. The recipients of Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and each recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participant s country. If the Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting the Participant s local partner resources representative. The Participant authorizes the Company, Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares received upon vesting of the Performance RSUs.

If the Participant does not consent, or if the Participant later seeks to revoke the Participant s consent, the Participant s employment or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Participant s consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Performance RSUs or other equity awards to the Participant or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, the Participant understands that refusal or withdrawal of the Participant s consent may affect the Participant s ability to participate in the Plan.

  22.  Waiver  .    If the Participant breaches or otherwise does not comply with any provision of this Agreement, but the Company does not act upon this breach or non-compliance and continues to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, this shall not mean that the Company waives any other provision of this Agreement or will otherwise permit any further breach of or non-compliance with any provision of this Agreement.   
    
  23.  Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws  .  The Participant acknowledges that, depending on the applicable jurisdiction, the Participant may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws, which may affect the Participant s ability to acquire or sell Shares or rights to Shares (e.g., Performance RSUs) under the Plan during such times as the Participant is considered to have  inside information  regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdiction). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company.  The Participant acknowledges that it is the Participant s responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and the Participant should consult with the Participant s own personal legal and financial advisors on this matter before taking any action related to the Plan. 
    
  24.  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting; Exchange Controls  .  The Participant s country may have certain foreign asset and/or account reporting requirements and/or exchange controls which may affect the Participant s ability to acquire or hold Shares under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends received or sale proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) in a brokerage or bank account outside the Participant s country.

  GLOBAL KEY EMPLOYEE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT AGREEMENT 
  2005 LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
  Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Appendix A but defined in the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, the Plan or any applicable country-specific sub-plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan, any applicable country-specific sub-plan and/or the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement. 
    
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
    
  This Appendix A, which is part of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Performance RSUs granted to the Participant under the Plan and that will apply to the Participant if he or she is in one of the countries listed below. 
    
  If the Participant is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to what extent the additional terms and conditions included herein will apply to the Participant under these circumstances. 
    
  NOTIFICATIONS 
    
  This Appendix A also includes information regarding exchange control and certain other issues of which the Participant should be aware with respect to his or her participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of August 2017.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Participant not rely on the information in this Appendix A as the only source of information relating to the consequences of his or her participation in the Plan because such information may be outdated when the Performance RSUs vest and/or when the Participant sells any Shares acquired at vesting of the Performance RSUs. 
    
  In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to the Participant s particular situation. As a result, the Company is not in a position to assure the Participant of any particular result. The Participant, therefore, should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country may apply to his or her situation. 
    
  Finally, if the Participant is a citizen or resident or a country other than that in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the information contained herein may not be applicable in the same manner to the Participant.

  The following provisions apply if the Participant is a resident of Quebec: 
    
  Language Consent.    The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that this Agreement, as well as all documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English. 
    
  Les parties reconnaissent avoir expressement souhait  que cette Convention, ainsi que tous les documents, avis et proc dures judiciaries,  xecut s, donn s ou intent s en vertu de, ou li , directement ou indirectement   la pr sente convention, soient r dig s en langue anglaise. 
    
  Data Privacy Notice and Consent.    The following provision supplements the Data Privacy section of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement: 
    
  The Participant hereby authorizes the Company and the Company s representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all personnel (professional or not) involved in the administration and operation of the Plan. The Participant further authorizes the Company, any Subsidiary and affiliate and the Employer to disclose and discuss the Participant s participation in the Plan with their advisors. The Participant further authorizes the Company, any Subsidiary and affiliate and the Employer to record such information and to keep it in the Participant s employee file. 
    
  NOTIFICATIONS 
    
  Securities Law Information  .      The Participant is permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided that the resale of such Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (  i.e  ., the NASDAQ Global Select Market). 
    
  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information.    Foreign specified property, including shares of stock (  i.e.  , Shares), options to purchase Shares and other rights to receive Shares (  e.g.  , Performance RSUs) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of his or her foreign specified property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year. Thus, Performance RSUs likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign specified property the Participant holds. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (   ACB   ) of the Shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if the Participant owns other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares. The Participant should consult with a personal tax advisor to ensure compliance with the applicable reporting obligations. 
    
  CHINA 
    
  The following applies only to Participants who are subject to exchange control restrictions in China, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 

Page   12   of 18 
  Global Key Employee Performance RSU Agreement 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
    
  Termination of Employment; Change of Control.    The following provision supplements the Termination of Employment; Change of Control section of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Agreement: 
    
  Due to legal restrictions in China, the Participant agrees that the Company reserves the right to require the automatic sale of any Shares acquired at vesting of the Performance RSUs upon the termination of the Participant s Active Status with the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company for any reason, including without limitation, voluntary termination by the Participant, termination because of the Participant s Retirement, Disability or death or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. The Participant hereby authorizes the sale of all Shares issued to him or her as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable termination of Active Status and pursuant to this authorization. The Participant further agrees that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares and the Participant expressly authorizes the Company s designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares. The Participant acknowledges that the Company s designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon the sale of Shares, the Participant will receive the sale proceeds less any amounts necessary to satisfy Tax-Related Items and applicable transaction fees or commissions. Due to currency exchange conversion rate fluctuation between the applicable vesting date of the Performance RSUs and (if later) the date on which the Shares are sold, the amount of sale proceeds may be more or less than the fair market value of the Shares on the applicable vesting date (which is the relevant amount for purposes of calculating amounts necessary to satisfy applicable Tax-Related Items). 
    
  Exchange Control Restriction.    Due to exchange control laws and regulations in China, the Participant will be required immediately to repatriate to China the cash proceeds from the sale of Shares and any cash dividends paid on such Shares. The Participant further understands that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effectuated through a special exchange control account established by the Company or a Subsidiary expressly for this purpose. By accepting the Performance RSUs, the Participant agrees that any cash proceeds from the sale of Shares or the receipt of any dividends may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to the Participant. The proceeds may be paid to the Participant in U.S. dollars or in local currency at the Company s discretion. If the proceeds are paid in U.S. dollars, the Participant understands that he or she will be required to open a U.S. dollar bank account in China and provide the bank account details to the Company or the Employer. The Participant acknowledges that, if the cash proceeds are paid in local currency, the Company is under no obligation to secure any particular currency exchange conversion rate. Furthermore, compliance with local exchange control laws and regulations may delay the conversion of cash proceeds into local currency. The Participant agrees that, if the conversion of the cash proceeds into local currency is delayed, he or she shall bear the risk of any currency exchange conversion rate fluctuation between the date on which the Shares issued at vesting of the Performance RSUs are sold or the cash dividend is paid and the date of conversion of the cash proceeds into local currency. The Participant further agrees to comply with any other requirements that the Company may impose in the future in order to facilitate compliance with exchange control requirements in China.   
    
  NOTIFICATIONS 
    
  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information.    The Participant may be required to report to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange all details of his or her foreign financial assets and liabilities, as well as details of any economic transactions conducted with non-China residents. Under these rules, the Participant may be subject to reporting obligations for the Performance RSUs, Shares acquired under the Plan and Plan-related transactions.

  Global Key Employee Performance RSU Agreement 

The Participant acknowledges that pursuant to Article 128 of the Colombian Labor Code, the Plan, the Performance RSUs and any income realized under the Plan do not constitute a component of the Participant s  salary  for any legal purpose. Therefore, they will not be included and/or considered for purposes of calculating any and all labor benefits, such as legal/fringe benefits, vacations, indemnities, payroll taxes, social insurance contributions and/or any other labor-related amount which may be payable. 
  NOTIFICATIONS 
  Securities Law Information.    The Shares are not and will not be registered with the Colombian registry of publicly traded securities (  Registro Nacional de Valores y Emisores  ) and therefore the Shares may not be offered to the public in Colombia.  Nothing in the Agreement should be construed as making a public offer of securities in Colombia. 
  Exchange Control Information.    If the Participant holds investments outside Colombia (including Shares the Participant acquires under the Plan) and the aggregate value of such investments is US$500,000 or more as of December 31 of any year, the Participant will be required to register such investments with the Central Bank (  Banco de la Rep blica  ) as foreign investments held abroad. Upon the subsequent sale or other disposition of any previously-registered investments, the Participant may choose to keep the resulting proceeds abroad, or to repatriate them to Colombia. If the Participant chooses to repatriate funds to Colombia and has not registered the investment with   Banco de la Rep blica,   a Form No. 5 must be filed with   Banco de la Rep blica   upon conversion of funds into local currency, which should be duly completed to reflect the nature of the transaction. If the investment was previously registered with   Banco de la Rep blica,   the Participant will need to file Form No. 4 upon conversion of funds into local currency, which should be duly completed to reflect the nature of the transaction. If Shares are sold immediately upon receipt, no registration is required because no Shares are held abroad.  It is the Participant s responsibility to comply with Colombian exchange control requirements. 
    
  Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information.    An annual informative return must be filed with the Colombian Tax Office detailing any assets held abroad (including Shares acquired under the Plan).  If the individual value of any of these assets exceeds a certain threshold, each asset must be described in detail, including the jurisdiction in which it is located, its nature and its value.
