Recent transactions 
  On December 6, 2017 the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. to become an investor in its subsidiary Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. ( GuoDa ), a leading retail pharmacy chain in China. Following a public tender process, the Company s bid met all the requirements set by the seller to acquire a 40 percent equity interest in GuoDa for approximately   $416 million  . On July 5, 2018, the Company acquired its 40 percent equity interest and began to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. See note   5  ,   equity method investments  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. 
    
  On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid Corporation ( Rite Aid ) for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The purchases of these stores occurred in waves during fiscal 2018 for total cash consideration of   $4.2 billion   and have been accounted for as business combinations. The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. Previously, on June 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid had terminated an amended agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which the Company had agreed to acquire Rite Aid. Pursuant to such termination, the Company paid Rite Aid a termination fee of $325 million. The Company also reimbursed $25 million of transaction costs of Fred s, Inc. in connection with the termination of an asset purchase agreement among the Company, Rite Aid and Fred s, Inc. that was subject to the completion of the acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens Boots Alliance. See note   7  ,   debt  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the termination of the amended agreement and plan of merger and related matters. 
    
  On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. See note   2  ,   acquisitions  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  In 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase an aggregate of 45,393,824 shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation ( AmerisourceBergen ) common stock for an aggregate exercise price payment of $2.36 billion. Following the August 25, 2016 warrant exercise, the Company does not hold any further warrants to purchase shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock. As of   August 31, 2018   and   2017  , the Company owned   56,854,867   AmerisourceBergen common shares, representing approximately   26%   of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock, which investment the Company accounts for using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors. As of   August 31, 2018  , the Company can acquire up to an additional   8,398,752   AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate a second member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. The warrants were issued in March 2013 pursuant to a Framework Agreement between Walgreens, Alliance Boots GmbH ( Alliance Boots ) and AmerisourceBergen. Concurrently, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various other agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which the Company sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through the Company s global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. 
    
  In addition, the Company has completed a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow its businesses and enhance its competitive position. Please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7, below and note   2  ,   acquisitions  , note   3  ,   exit and disposal activities  , and note   5  ,   equity method investments  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8, below for additional information. 

Industry overview 
  The retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and dynamic and have experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. The Company believes the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States,  baby boomers  increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical

     Table of Contents  

wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients. 
    
  The retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third-party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third-party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the United States, can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the  ACA ) was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending, including for prescription drugs, in the United States. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements in the United States. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements. When third-party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.  
    
  These industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years. Since the completion of the strategic combination with Alliance Boots in December 2014, the Company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction. During fiscal 2019, the Company intends to maintain this focus, including the evaluation of a number of potential strategic cost management initiatives. 
    
  Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third-party payers. The Company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the United States, generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a  generic conversion . In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars. 
    
  The Company expects that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the Company competes to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and the Company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management. 

Segments 
  Our operations are organized into three divisions, which are also our reportable segments:  

Retail Pharmacy USA; 
                
    Retail Pharmacy International; and 
                
    Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
       
  For fiscal   2018  , our segment sales were: Retail Pharmacy USA,   $98.4 billion  ; Retail Pharmacy International,   $12.3 billion  ; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale,   $23.0 billion  . Additional information relating to our segments is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below and in note   16  ,   segment reporting  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 

Retail Pharmacy USA 
  The Retail Pharmacy USA division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy. The Company operated   9,560   retail stores in the division as of   August 31, 2018  . The principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are Walgreens and Duane Reade. The Company is a market leader in the United States and, as of   August 31,  
  
   -   3   - 

     Table of Contents  

2018  , approximately   78%   of the population of the United States lived within five miles of a Walgreens, Duane Reade or acquired Rite Aid retail pharmacy. 
    
  The division provides customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise such as NICE!, DeLish       , Soap   Glory, No7 and Well at Walgreens, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across America. Integrated with the Company s e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive alerts when a refill is due and perform retail functionality, such as ordering photo prints, shopping for products and clipping coupons. 
    
  The Company s services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. The Company utilizes its retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to its customers and patients, as illustrated by the Company s ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. The Company also provides specialty pharmacy and mail services. As of   August 31, 2018  , the Company had approximately   400   in-store clinic locations throughout the United States, some of which are operated by the Company and some of which are operated by health system partners. The Company has more than   85,000   healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals. 
    
  The components of the division s sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, beauty, toiletries and general merchandise). The division s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the winter holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons. This seasonality also can affect the division s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the division s fiscal year sales were as follows: 

The Company filled   823.1 million   prescriptions (including immunizations) in the division in fiscal   2018  . Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were   1.1 billion   in fiscal   2018  . Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were approximately   98%   of the division s fiscal   2018   Pharmacy sales. 
    
  The Company fills prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately   4%   of the division s fiscal   2018   sales. Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately   19%   of the division s fiscal   2018   sales. 
    
  The Company s U.S. loyalty program, Balance  Rewards, is designed to reward its most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online. Balance  Rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed in store or through walgreens.com. As of   August 31, 2018  , the number of active Balance  Rewards members totaled approximately   88 million  . For this purpose, an active member is defined here as someone who has used their card in the last six months. 
    
  AmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the division s pharmacies. The Company purchases its non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. 
    
  The division s sales, gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of the Company s control can affect timing for a generic conversion, the Company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods. 
    
  The current environment of the Company s pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry.

     Table of Contents  

The Company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third-party payers; agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and the Company s reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal   2018   as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue. 
    
  The Company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. 
    
  The Company s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides the Company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. 

Retail Pharmacy International 
  The Retail Pharmacy International division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in   eight   countries, each focused on helping people look and feel their best. The Company operated   4,767   retail stores in the division as of   August 31, 2018   (see properties in part I, item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage) and has grown its online presence significantly in recent years. The Company s principal retail pharmacy brands are Boots in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and The Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. In Europe, the Company is a market leader and its retail stores are conveniently located and its pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities the Company serves. 
    
  The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands the Company owns, such as No7, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Soap   Glory, Liz Earle, Sleek MakeUp, Botanics and  only at Boots  exclusive products, together with its long established reputation for trust and customer care. The Company s brands portfolio is enhanced by its in-house product research and development capabilities. 
    
  The Company s retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the United Kingdom, through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, the  order and collect  service allows customers to order from a range of over   33,000   products by 8:00 p.m. and collect from noon the following day from approximately   99%   of the United Kingdom s retail stores as of   August 31, 2018  . 
    
  The Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of   August 31, 2018  , the number of active Boots Advantage Card members totaled approximately   15 million  . For this purpose, an active member is defined as someone who has used their card in the last six months. 
    
  In addition, Boots in the United Kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with   618   practices, of which   167   operated on a franchise basis as of   August 31, 2018  . Approximately   30%   of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices. 
    
  The components of the division s sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the United Kingdom, the provision of optical services).

The division s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the division s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the division s fiscal year sales were as follows: 

The division s Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically the Company and its competitors  pricing actions, promotional offers and events and the customer s desire for value and convenience. 
    
  The division s Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third-party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the United Kingdom, which is the division s largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis. 
    
  In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British pound sterling being the most significant. 

Pharmaceutical Wholesale 
  The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division (excluding equity method investments), which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand, supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to more than   110,000   pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year from   291   distribution centers in   11   countries, primarily in Europe, as of   August 31,     2018  . 
    
  The distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the division s sales. The wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery, product availability, delivery accuracy, timeliness and reliability at competitive prices. The Company also offers customers innovative added-value services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses. This includes membership of Alphega Pharmacy, the Company s pan-European network for independent pharmacies, which, as of   August 31, 2018  , had over   6,600   members. 
    
  In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, the division s businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers which are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics (mainly under the Alloga brand), direct deliveries to pharmacies and innovative and specialized healthcare services, covering clinical homecare, medicine support, dispensing services, medicine preparation and clinical trial support (mainly under the Alcura brand). 
    
  Combined with local engagement, scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling. Walgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in Europe, and it ranks as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which it operates. 
    
  The division s sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on the Company s revenues. However, in the wholesale division, the Company typically earns equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs, although there are exceptions. 
    
  Changes in manufacturers  product distribution business models can also impact the division s sales and gross margin. For example, when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce fee-for-service contracts, the Company s sales are reduced even if it is successful in winning these contracts, as the Company only recognizes sales for the amount of the fees charged. Other manufacturer services, including pre-wholesale and contract logistics operations, are typically on a fee-for-service basis. 
    
  In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British pound sterling and the Euro being the most significant. The division s sales are subject to less seasonality than the Company s other divisions. 

Intellectual property and licenses 
  
   -   6   - 

     Table of Contents  

The Company markets products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns numerous domain names, holds numerous patents, has registered numerous trademarks and has filed applications for the registration of a number of other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. The Company holds assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of the business. 

Seasonal variations in business 
  The Walgreens Boots Alliance business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, its sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of its own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third-party payers. See the summary of quarterly results (unaudited) in note   18  ,   supplementary financial information  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below. 

Sources and availability of raw materials 
  Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. The Company does not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on its business or that of any of its divisions. 

Working capital practices 
  Effective inventory management is important to the Company s operations. The Company uses various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Its working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. The Company generally finances its inventory and expansion needs with internally-generated funds and short-term debt. For additional information, see the liquidity and capital resources section in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7, below. 

Customers 
  The Company sells to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company s consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. In fiscal 2018, substantially all of our retail pharmacy sales were to customers covered by third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases. Three third-party payers, in the Retail Pharmacy USA division, in the aggregate accounted for approximately   32%   of the Company s consolidated sales in fiscal   2018  . 
    
  See note   16  ,   segment reporting  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Regulation 
  In the countries in which the Company does business, the Company is subject to national, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to the Company s participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA  the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of the Company s businesses. The Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions. 
    
  The Company is also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which it does business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of its businesses, the Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances. Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect on the results of operations or capital expenditures of the Company in fiscal   2018  . 

Competitive conditions 
  
   -   7   - 

     Table of Contents  

The industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, the Company competes with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. The Company s pharmaceutical wholesale businesses compete with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. The Company competes primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Its geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See  properties  in part I, item 2, below for further information regarding the Company s geographic dispersion. 

Employees 
  As of   August 31, 2018  , the Company employed approximately   354,000   persons, approximately   110,000   of whom were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. The foregoing does not include employees of equity method investments. 

Research and development 
  While the global brands portfolio of the Company is enhanced by in-house product research and development capabilities, the amount spent by the Company on research and development activities is not material. 

Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales 
  Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations, including total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, is included in note   16  ,   segment reporting  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. See  risk factors  in part I, item 1A below for information regarding risks attendant to the Company s foreign operations. 

Available information 
  The Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as well as proxy statements and registration statements. You may read and copy any material filed by the Company with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically. The Company makes available free of charge on or through its website at  
  http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files or furnishes them to the SEC. The contents of the website are not, however, a part of this Form 10-K or the Company s other SEC filings. 

Item 1A.  Risk factors 
  In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. 
    
  Reductions in third-party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  The substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third-party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBM companies, governmental agencies, and other third-party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. In the United States, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, in an environment where some PBM clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.  
    
  Changes in political, economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices. In the United States, for example, there have been multiple attempts through executive action, legislative action and legal challenges to modify or repeal the ACA. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify or repeal these laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a modification or repeal and any  
  
   -   8   - 

     Table of Contents  

subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels. There have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future. In the event that a third-party payer s budgetary or financial condition deteriorates, they may not be able to pay timely, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In many countries where we have operations, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuous and reductions in third-party reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  In addition, many payers in the United States are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost, which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements. Future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third-party payers, could adversely affect us.  
    
  A shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  Our Retail Pharmacy USA division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure. A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, our Retail Pharmacy USA division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in recent years. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions in recent years, and that trend may continue. Preferred Medicare Part D networks have increased in number in recent years; however, we do not participate in all such networks. We have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
    
  We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies. 
    
  We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM company s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans. 
    
  We could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.  
    
  The profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. Inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. New brand name drugs can  
  
   -   9   - 

     Table of Contents  

result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their introduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  
    
  In addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations.  
    
  Consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. 
    
  New and proposed acquisitions, partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning. For example, in December 2017, CVS Health Corporation, an integrated pharmacy health care company that operates one of the largest retail drugstore chains and PBM companies in the United States, announced an agreement to acquire Aetna, Inc., one of the largest diversified health care benefits companies, subject to certain closing conditions. Changes in the participants in global sourcing enterprises relating to drug procurement, whether as a result of mergers, acquisitions or other transactions, can also have a similar effect on market dynamics and our business. In addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with, and which could, if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner, materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances.  
    
  A significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. We have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire, partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives. Due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete, there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available. There can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available, that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities, or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein.  
    
  Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders  percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or  
  
   -   10   - 

     Table of Contents  

results of operations. If we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner, our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected. 
    
  Our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships. We outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. For example, in 2017 we entered into a 10-year global agreement with Fareva for the manufacture and supply of own beauty brands and private label products. Under the terms of the agreement, Fareva acquired BCM, Walgreens Boots Alliance s contract manufacturing business, in October 2017. We rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. If our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with any transition, we may experience operational difficulties, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. 
    
  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of assets from Rite Aid pursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, which could adversely impact our results of operations. 
    
  We entered into the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain Rite Aid stores and distribution centers with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including completion of the pending acquisition of distribution centers and related inventory expected to begin during fiscal 2019, whether the acquired assets can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. We can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of the acquired assets into our business and operations will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties  business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. 
    
  We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues resulting from the transaction. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention, which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the transaction and expect to continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the acquired Rite Aid assets. These integration and acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material. 
    
  Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives. 
    
  Our Board of Directors approved the plan to implement the Store Optimization Program described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this program. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the Store Optimization Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. New entrants to the market, existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us.  
    
  The level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation, or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation, by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. For example, in June 2018, online retailer Amazon.com, Inc. announced its pending acquisition of PillPack, an online pharmacy with licenses throughout the United States, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Some industry analysts have speculated that the acquisition, if completed, could provide a platform for Amazon to significantly expand into the market for prescription drugs. Our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. For example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms. 
    
  We also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. As technology, consumer behavior and market conditions continue to evolve in the United States, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and product and service offerings to customers and patients. In April 2018, we announced that we are testing a number of concepts and initiatives designed to position our stores in the United States as convenient community hubs for healthcare and retail products and services. The concepts being tested include new approaches to pricing and promotions, product selection, in-store and digital experience, and strategic partnerships that bring new products and services to our customers. We plan to use these pilots to listen to customers, learn and adjust based on feedback, with decisions on the nature and extent of further roll-outs made over time as we gain experience. If our customers are not receptive to these changes, if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner, or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics, our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. As a further example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. Accordingly, it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving market, or our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. To better serve this evolving market, in March 2017, we and Prime Therapeutics LLC, a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, PBM and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. If this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
    
  Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks. 
    
  Our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions, and are subject to a number of risks, including: 

compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, immigration, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time;

additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws; 

potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; 

price controls imposed by foreign countries; 

tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets;  

potential adverse tax consequences, including tax withholding laws and policies and restrictions on repatriation of funds to the United States;  

fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 

impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the United States, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses; 

the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and 

developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services. 
       
  These factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition. 
    
  Many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political, economic and regulatory influences. For example: 

Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the United Kingdom and other member countries of the European Union. In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. Subsequently, in March 2017, the United Kingdom s government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which formally triggered the two-year negotiation process to exit the European Union. Negotiations to determine the United Kingdom s future relationship with the European Union, including terms of trade, are complex, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. The proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. Further, uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the United Kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates. 

Many of the products we sell are manufactured in whole or in part outside of the United States. In some cases, these products are imported by others and sold to us. In the United States, the Presidential Administration has discussed, and in some cases implemented, changes with respect to certain tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. For example, there are growing concerns regarding trade relations between the United States and China, as both countries recently indicated their intention to impose significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. As a significant portion of our retail products are sourced from China, the imposition on the United States of new tariffs on certain goods imported from China could adversely impact the cost and profitability of retail product sales in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. While it is not possible to predict whether or when any future changes will occur or what form they may take, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries could result in significant increases in our costs, restrict our access to certain suppliers and adversely impact economic

     Table of Contents  

activity. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in United States trade policy and regulations.  
    
  There can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.  
    
  We are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  
    
  Our significant operations outside of the United States expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses  functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.  
    
  We may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us, that could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results. 
    
  Disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses. 
    
  The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a supplier s financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  We use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our Retail Pharmacy USA division. 
    
  In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergen s board of directors in certain circumstances. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes for our Retail Pharmacy USA division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products. Consequently, our business in the United States may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences. For example, if AmerisourceBergen s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the United States and our results of operations. 
    
  Our distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew  
  
   -   14   - 

     Table of Contents  

the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized. 
    
  We entered into the arrangement with AmerisourceBergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies, whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. 
    
  As of August 31, 2018, we beneficially owned approximately 26% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors. In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013 by and among the Company, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen (the  Framework Agreement ) to acquire up to an additional   8,398,752   AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. There can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in AmerisourceBergen, or that our existing investment, or any future investment if completed, will ultimately be profitable. If the price of AmerisourceBergen common stock subsequently declines substantially, we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with AmerisourceBergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration resulting from these agreements. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  From time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks. 
    
  From time to time, we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. For example, while we have a significant equity investment in AmerisourceBergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of AmerisourceBergen as of the date of this report, we do not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. Although the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. For example, in July 2018, we acquired a 40% minority stake in Sinopharm Holding GuoDa Drugstores Co., Ltd., a leading retail pharmacy chain in China. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. From time to time, we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks.  
    
  Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices. 

-   15   - 

     Table of Contents  

Our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Economic conditions in Europe and certain emerging market countries, together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments, could adversely affect us. 
    
  We have significant assets and operations within Europe and certain emerging market countries in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. An economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In recent years, in response to the economic environment, a number of governments, including the government in the United Kingdom, have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the government-sponsored healthcare systems and constrain overall government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. Countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. In addition, governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future. Any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations.  
    
  If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
    
  The portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and the pace of this increase could accelerate in the future. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases, as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.  
    
  If the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected. 
    
  We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. The success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. For example, our proof of concept initiatives that seek to position our stores in the United States as convenient community hubs for healthcare and retail products and services reflect the perceived desires and needs of our target market. However, it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers  purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer  
  
   -   16   - 

     Table of Contents  

tastes, preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. 
    
  Our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks. 
    
  In addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offering of No7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors  products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  We face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success, and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance. 
    
  Our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives and there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees, or an unexpected loss of leadership, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
    
  In addition, our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. 
    
  We may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems. 
    
  We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. While we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payers and vendors.

If we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. 
    
  The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Like other global companies, we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. 
    
  We depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including payers, strategic partners and cloud service providers. These third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. Like us, these third-parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and cyber-attacks and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt or close down their networks or systems. Security processes, protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such third-parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events, which could result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, or misuse of, information or systems that are important to our business, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information. 
    
  The regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. In the United States, for example, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by all participants in the health care industry. Some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the United States and continue to change. For example, the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation, which greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance, became effective in May 2018. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders. Complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and operating results. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations. 
    
  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay , and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  Changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses. 
    
  Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers  pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability. 
    
  In the United States, electoral results and changes in political leadership have generated uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries. There have been multiple attempts to repeal, modify or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify these laws and/or adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results. Future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the ACA or otherwise could adversely impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage, increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative, rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  
    
  A significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability. 
    
  We operate in complex, highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the

protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the United States the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit, competition and antitrust matters. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party s intellectual property rights. 
    
  Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including:  suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues. 
    
  We could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labeling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling, and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. We could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  We have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt. 
    
  We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of August 31, 2018, we had approximately   $14 billion   of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term debt. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: 

requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends; 

-   20   - 

     Table of Contents  

making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; 

reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions; 

making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and 

exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates. 
       
  We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants. 
    
  Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. 
    
  We could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets. 
    
  Historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. Our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. We benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agency s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit ratings. We depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them. Defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. 
    
  We may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  
    
  We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. In addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. If we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term. If we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  
    
  As a holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations. 

-   21   - 

     Table of Contents  

Walgreens Boots Alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to meet its obligations. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliance s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Walgreens Boots Alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. Payments to Walgreens Boots Alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries  earnings and business considerations. Future Walgreens Boots Alliance dividends will be determined based on earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its Board of Directors. 
    
  Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly. 
    
  Our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; seasonality; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance. 
    
  Our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results. 
    
  Our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. We purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. This could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year. 
    
  We could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters. 
    
  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, equity method investments, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the Company s reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, including investments held by our equity method investees, may have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in.  
    
  New accounting guidance also may require changes to our processes, accounting systems and internal controls that could increase our operating costs and/or significantly change our financial statements. For example, in February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which  
  
   -   22   - 

     Table of Contents  

supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU, which is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. See,  new accounting pronouncements,  within note   1  ,   summary of major accounting policies  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Implementing this ASU, as well as other new accounting guidance may require us to make significant upgrades to and investments in our lease administration systems and other accounting systems, and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements.  
    
  We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations. 
    
  As of August 31, 2018, we had   $28.7 billion   of goodwill and other intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluate this goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of this impairment analysis, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings. 
    
  We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, including those contained in note   10  ,   commitments and contingencies  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. In addition, under the   qui tam   or  whistleblower  provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of  false  claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management s attention and resources. 
    
  We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws. 
    
  We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the  FCPA ), U.S. export control, anti-money laundering and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export

licenses. In addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. 
    
  We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. 
    
  We are a large corporation with operations in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision.  
    
  From time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. For example, the U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 represents a significant overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code. This tax legislation significantly reduced the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate and made other changes that could have a favorable impact on our overall U.S. federal tax liability in a given period. However, the tax legislation also included a number of provisions, including, but not limited to, the limitation or elimination of various deductions or credits (including for interest expense and for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m)), the imposition of taxes on certain cross-border payments or transfers, the changing of the timing of the recognition of certain income and deductions or their character, and the limitation of asset basis under certain circumstances, that could significantly and adversely affect our U.S. federal income tax position. The legislation also made significant changes to the tax rules applicable to insurance companies and other entities with which we do business. We are continuing to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and U.S. federal income tax position. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  Tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  Our insurance strategies may expose us to unexpected costs. 
    
  We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers  compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers  liability; and employee healthcare benefits. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Substantial, unanticipated losses or liabilities, including those due to natural disasters or otherwise, as well as changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  We could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities. 
    
  We operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. The valuation of the pension plan s assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is  
  
   -   24   - 

     Table of Contents  

particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval. 
    
  As of September 30, 2018, affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the  SP Investors ), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 15.3% of our outstanding common stock. The SP Investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Board s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). The SP Investors  significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors could result in the Company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.  
    
  Shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots are eligible for future sale. 
    
  The shares issued to the SP Investors and certain other former Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots generally may now be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement (as amended, the  Company Shareholders Agreement ) with certain of the SP Investors. In addition, the Company Shareholders Agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us, in certain instances, to file future registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders or to permit a  piggyback  on a future registration statement. A sale, or the perception that a sale may occur, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock. 
    
  Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with.  
    
  Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and other parties to the Company Shareholders Agreement, including the SP Investors. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, indirectly controls Alliance Sant  Participations S.A. ( ASP ), a privately-held company which is a party to the Company Shareholders Agreement, and he and his partner Ornella Barra, our Co-Chief Operating Officer, serve as directors of ASP. There are other arrangements between affiliates of Mr. Pessina and the Company, with required disclosures included in the Company s annual proxy statement. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties  conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies. 
    
  Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover. 
    
  Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the  DGCL ), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of  blank check  preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant  
  
   -   25   - 

     Table of Contents  

sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock. 
    
  Under the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina) for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Board s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). 
    
  While these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. See also the risk factor captioned  Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  above. 
    
  We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. 
    
  In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. The repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. 
    
  The market price of our common stock may be volatile. 
    
  The market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition to the other risk factors identified in this Item 1A, factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of the shares include: 

actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors; 

changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts that might cover us;  

conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures; 

announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us; 

additions or departures of key personnel;  

issuances or sales of our common stock, including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the SP Investors; and  

various other market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors or speculation, whether or not correct, involving or affecting us or our industries, vendors, customers, strategic partners or competitors. 
       
  There are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results. 
    
  Many other factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including: 

If we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, our sales or sales margins could be negatively affected. 

Our operating costs may be subject to increases outside the control of our businesses, whether due to inflation, new or increased taxes, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in market conditions or otherwise.

Our success depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain store, professional and management personnel, including in executive and other key strategic positions, and the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow. 

Natural disasters, civil unrest, severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can interrupt or otherwise adversely impact our operations or damage our facilities or those of our strategic partners, vendors and customers and have an adverse impact on consumer confidence levels and spending on our products and services. 

If we or our affiliates were to incur significant liabilities or expense relating to the protection of the environment, related health and safety matters, environmental remediation or compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

Item 6.  Selected financial data 
  Five-Year Summary of Selected Consolidated Financial Data 
  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

1   
    Effective March 18, 2016, the Company began accounting for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag. 
               2   
    On August 2, 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of 45% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Alliance Boots in exchange for cash and Company shares. The Company accounted for this investment under the equity method until it completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots on December 31, 2014. As a result, fiscal 2015 includes the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and four months (September through December 2014) as equity earnings in Alliance Boots reflecting Walgreens  pre-merger 45% interest. 
               3   
    In fiscal 2015, as a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, the Company s previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million. 
               4   
    Fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale of the Company s equity interest in Premise Health, partially offset by the impairment of the Company s equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded other income (expense) of $(517) million, $779 million and $385 million, respectively, from fair value adjustments of the AmerisourceBergen warrants and the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the warrants. Fiscal 2016 also includes income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for the Company s investment in AmerisourceBergen. Fiscal 2015 also includes a $94 million loss on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. In fiscal 2014, the Company recognized a non-cash loss of $866 million related

Item 7.  Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
  The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Company s business and reportable segments in item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in part I, item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our  refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor Walgreen Co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. 

INTRODUCTION 
  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( Walgreens Boots Alliance ) and its subsidiaries are a global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments: 
             
    Retail Pharmacy USA; 
                
    Retail Pharmacy International; and 
                
    Pharmaceutical Wholesale 
       
  See note   16  ,   segment reporting  , for further information. 
    
  Acquisition of certain Rite Aid Corporation (     Rite Aid     ) assets 
  On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The Company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores. The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement.  
    
  The Company continues to expect to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets by the end of fiscal 2020, at an estimated total cost of approximately $750 million, which is reported as acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2018, the Company recognized pre-tax charges to its financial results of $  221 million   related to integration of the acquired stores and related assets. In addition, the Company continues to expect to spend approximately $500 million of capital on store conversions and related activities. The Company expects annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million, compared to the Company s previously stated expectation of $300 million, which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of this transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. 
    
  The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See  cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements  below. 
    
  Comparability 
  The influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, for example the acquisition of stores and other assets from Rite Aid, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations, changes in laws, for example the U.S. tax law changes, the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Company s operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
  Premise Health 
  On June 28, 2018, Premise Health Holding Corp. and OMERS, a Canadian pension fund, announced that an affiliate of OMERS would acquire control of Premise Health, an entity in which the Company indirectly held a minority equity interest. In July 2018, the Company completed the sale of its minority equity interest in Premise Health, resulting in an after-tax gain on disposition of $  245 million  . The Company treated this transaction as a special item, which is reported as a gain on sale of equity method investment impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures for fiscal   2018  . 
    
  Investment in Chinese Pharmacy Chain GuoDa 
  
   -   34   - 

     Table of Contents  

On December 6, 2017 the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. to become an investor in its subsidiary Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. ( GuoDa ), a leading retail pharmacy chain in China. 
    
  Following a public tender process, the Company s bid met all the requirements set by the seller to acquire a 40 percent equity interest in GuoDa for approximately   $416 million  . On July 5, 2018, the Company acquired its 40 percent equity interest and began to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. See note   5  ,   equity method investments  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. 
    
  U.S. tax law changes 
  The United States government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in December 2017. The U.S. tax law changes include broad and complex changes affecting the Company's fiscal 2018 and future results. Among other things, the U.S. tax law changes reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and require companies to immediately accrue for a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over an eight year period. The U.S. tax law changes modify the taxation of foreign earnings, repeal the deduction for domestic production activities, limit interest deductibility and establish a global intangible low tax income (GILTI) regime. 
    
  In connection with the Company s ongoing analysis of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, which is provisional and subject to change, the Company recorded a net tax   benefit   of   $125 million   during fiscal   2018  . This provisional net tax benefit arises from a benefit of   $648 million   from re-measuring the Company s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partly offset by the Company s accrual for the transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes of   $523 million  . As of   August 31, 2018  , while the Company made reasonable estimates of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, the final impact may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in its interpretations and assumptions, technical clarifications from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS and actions the Company may take.  
    
  In addition, the Company s results for fiscal   2018   also include a net reduction to the effective tax rate for the current year as a result of the U.S. tax law changes. The lower corporate income tax rate of 21% became effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 26% for fiscal 2018 and 21% for subsequent fiscal years, which provided a benefit to the fiscal 2018 tax provision of approximately   $307 million  . 

EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES 
  Store Optimization Program 
  On October 24, 2017, the Company s Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the  Store Optimization Program ) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the Company s Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and are expected to take place over an 18 month period. The Store Optimization Program is expected to result in cost savings of approximately $325 million per year, compared to the Company s previously stated expectation of $300 million, to be fully delivered by the end of fiscal 2020.  
    
  The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $450 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures. 
    
  The Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") of   $100 million  , which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges included   $19 million   related to lease obligations and other real estate costs and   $81 million   in employee severance and other exit costs. 
    
  Store Optimization Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Store Optimization Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.  
    
  The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See  cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements  below.  
    
  Cost Transformation Program

     Table of Contents  

On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the  Cost Transformation Program ) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implemented and built on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by Walgreens on August 6, 2014 and included a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. In April 2015, the Company announced that it had identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increased the total expected cost savings of the Cost Transformation Program by $500 million to a targeted $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017, with significant areas of focus including plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focused primarily on the Company s Retail Pharmacy USA segment. The Company achieved the targeted $1.5 billion in savings from the Cost Transformation Program ahead of schedule. As announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company closed a total of approximately 260 stores.  
    
  The Company completed the Cost Transformation Program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and over the duration of the program, 255 stores were closed. Full program benefits will be recognized in subsequent periods. The Company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its fiscal 2017 financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.8 billion. These charges included $743 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; $665 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); and $393 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. The Company estimates that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time, primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. See note   3  ,   exit and disposal activities  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION RELATIONSHIP 
  In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through WBAD. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. 
    
  In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergen s Board of Directors in certain circumstances. Please refer to the Company s Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements.  
    
  On March 18, 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion.

As of   August 31, 2018  , the Company owned   56,854,867   AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately   26%   of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors. As of   August 31, 2018  , the Company can acquire up to an additional   8,398,752   AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. 
    
  Effective March 18, 2016, the Company began accounting for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment being classified within the operating income of the Company s Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment.

WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Fiscal   2018   compared to fiscal   2017    
  Fiscal   2018   net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance   increase  d   23.2   percent to   $5.0 billion  , while diluted net earnings per share   increase  d   33.6   percent to   $5.05   compared with the prior year. The   increase  s primarily reflect the Company s Cost Transformation Program in prior year, operating performance and the gain on sale of the Company s equity interest in Premise Health, partially offset by certain legal and regulatory accruals and an impairment of the Company s equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Diluted net earnings per share was also positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. 
    
  Other income for fiscal   2018   was   $177 million   compared to an expense of   $11 million   for fiscal   2017  . Other income for fiscal   2018   includes the gain on sale of the Company s equity interest Premise Health, partially offset by the impairment of the Company s equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation. 
    
  Interest was a net expense of   $616 million   and   $693 million   in fiscal   2018   and   2017  , respectively.

The effective tax rate for fiscal   2018   and   2017   was   16.7%   and   15.7%  , respectively. The net   increase   in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings, partly offset by a provisional net tax benefit of   $125 million   as a result of U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017. In addition, the Company s results for fiscal 2018 also include a net reduction to the effective tax rate for the current year as a result of the U.S. tax law changes. 
    
  Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal   2018   compared to fiscal   2017    
  Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal   2018     increase  d   8.8   percent to   $6.0 billion   compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal   2018     increase  d   18.0   percent to   $6.02   compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were   positively   impacted by   0.8   percentage points and   0.9   percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation. 
    
  Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal   2018   primarily reflect the impact of U.S. tax law changes and increased adjusted operating income. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was also positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. See  --Non-GAAP Measures  below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 

Fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016    
  Fiscal 2017 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance decreased 2.3 percent to $4.1 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 1.0 percent to $3.78 compared with the prior year. The decreases reflect Rite Aid related costs, the phasing of the Company s Cost Transformation Program and the impact in the prior year of the change in accounting method for the Company s investment in AmerisourceBergen, largely offset by the reduction in the fair value of the Company s AmerisourceBergen warrants, improvements in selling, general and administration expenses before cost transformation expenses and a lower effective tax rate. 
    
  Other expense for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $11 million and $261 million, respectively. In fiscal 2016, the change in fair value of the Company s AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in a loss of $517 million, and additionally, the Company recognized income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for its investment in AmerisourceBergen. 
    
  Interest was a net expense of $693 million and $596 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase mainly reflects the prefunded acquisition financing costs relating to the Rite Aid transaction.  
    
  The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 15.7% and 19.4%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings, favorable changes in permanent differences between the Company s financial statement earnings and taxable profits as well as incremental discrete tax benefits. The mix of pre-tax earnings was notably impacted by the Cost Transformation Program and costs associated with the termination of the Rite Aid Merger Agreement, both of which reduced the Company s U.S. pre-tax earnings. For fiscal 2017, net discrete tax benefits resulted primarily from deferred tax benefits related to a change in the U.K. tax rate, adopting ASU 2016-09 and net tax benefits associated with prior tax years. 
    
  Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016    
  Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2017 increased 9.9 percent to $5.5 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2017 increased 11.1 percent to $5.10 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 1.7 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation. 
    
  Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen and a lower effective tax rate. See  --Non-GAAP Measures  below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
  The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  
    
  These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because the Company s management has evaluated its financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when

analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented. 
    
  The Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in  constant currency,  which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $0.8 billion   (including   $0.2 billion   in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of   August 31, 2018  , compared to   $3.3 billion   (including   $1.8 billion   in non-U.S. jurisdictions) at   August 31, 2017  . Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds and AAA-rated money market funds. 
    
  The Company s long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in its core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce those core strategies and meet return requirements and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company s Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company s dividend policy to set forth the Company s current intention to increase its dividend each year.  
    
  Cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was   $8.3 billion   in fiscal   2018   compared to   $7.3 billion   in fiscal   2017   and   $7.8 billion   in fiscal   2016  . The   $1.0 billion     increase   in cash provided by operating activities includes lower income taxes paid and lower cash outflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by higher cash outflows from trade accounts payable and other non-current liabilities. Changes in income taxes paid are mainly due to the impact of the U.S. tax law changes. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities, trade accounts payable and other non-current liabilities are mainly driven by the timing of accruals and payments including cash inflows post acquisition of Rite Aid assets in fiscal   2018   and cash inflows from term changes on pharmaceutical related purchases in fiscal   2017  . 
    
  Net cash used for investing activities was   $5.5 billion   in fiscal   2018   compared to   $0.8 billion   in fiscal   2017   and   $3.5 billion   in fiscal   2016  . Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal   2018   were   $4.8 billion   compared to   $0.1 billion   for the year-ago period. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal   2018   include the acquisition of Rite Aid assets and the investment in GuoDa. Fiscal 2016 included the acquisition of an international beauty brand and prescription files, as well as an investment in AmerisourceBergen of $2.4 billion as a result of the exercise of warrants. 
    
  Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal   2018   were   $1.4 billion   compared to   $1.4 billion   in fiscal   2017   and   $1.3 billion   in fiscal   2016  . Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

Additionally, investing activities for fiscal   2018   did not include any proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions, compared to   $444 million   in the comparable prior year period. 
    
  Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal   2018   was   $5.3 billion   compared to net cash used for financing activities of   $12.9 billion   in fiscal   2017   and net cash provided by financing activities of   $2.6 billion   in fiscal   2016  . The Company repurchased shares as part of the stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling   $5.2 billion   in fiscal   2018   compared to   $5.2 billion   in fiscal   2017   and   $1.2 billion   in fiscal   2016  . Proceeds related to employee stock plans were   $174 million   in fiscal   2018   compared to   $217 million   in fiscal   2017   and   $235 million   in fiscal   2016  . Cash dividends paid were   $1.7 billion   in fiscal   2018   compared to   $1.7 billion   and   $1.6 billion   in fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  , respectively. In fiscal   2018   there were   $5.9 billion   in proceeds primarily from revolving facilities described below and commercial paper debt compared to no proceeds in   2017   and   $6.0 billion   in proceeds received from U.S. dollar denominated debt offerings in fiscal 2016 (a portion of which was redeemed in fiscal 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes, as described below).  
    
  The Company believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for the Company s foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. The Company s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. 
    
  See item 7A, qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks. 
    
  Stock repurchase programs 
  In April 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the  April 2017 stock repurchase program ), which authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the program s expiration on December 31, 2017. In May 2017, the Company completed the April 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 11.8 million shares. In June 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the program s expiration on August 31, 2018, which authorization was increased by an additional $1.0 billion in October 2017 (as expanded, the  June 2017 stock repurchase program ). In October 2017, the Company completed the June 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 77.4 million shares. In June 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program (the  June 2018 stock repurchase program ), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock of which the Company had repurchased   $2.7 billion   as of   August 31, 2018  . The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date.  
    
  The Company purchased   72 million   and   59 million   shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal   2018   and   2017   at a cost of   $4.9 billion   and   $4.8 billion  , respectively. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. 
    
  Commercial paper

The Company had   $430 million   commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of   August 31, 2018   and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of   August 31, 2017  . The Company had average daily short-term borrowings of   $1.4 billion   of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of   2.11%   for the fiscal year ended   August 31, 2018   and no activity under its commercial paper program for the fiscal year ended   August 31, 2017  .  
    
  Financing actions

On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the  2014 Revolving Credit Agreement ), which had available credit of $3.0 billion, of which $500 million was available for the issuance of letters of credit. The 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms and conditions as of August 29, 2018, and as of that date, there were no borrowings outstanding. The 2014 Revolving Credit Facility was terminated concurrently with the execution of the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement described below.  
    
  On November 18, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued several series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes totaling $8.0 billion, with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2044.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The information set forth in note   10  ,   commitments and contingencies  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. We use the following methods to determine our estimates: 
    
  Business combinations         We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. 
    
  For intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections. 
    
  Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. 
  
   -   52   - 

     Table of Contents  

Judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset s useful life. 
    
  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment     Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. 
    
  The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. 
    
  We also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the Company s fair value as implied by the market value of the Company s equity securities. This comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. However, future declines in the overall market value of the Company s equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value. 
    
  The fair values of the Company s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately   11%   to approximately   312%  . The fair value of our Boots reporting unit, within our Retail Pharmacy International division, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately   11%  . We will continue to monitor the U.K. industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the Boots reporting unit. See note   6  ,   goodwill and other intangible assets  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
    
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. 
    
  Our indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability. 
    
  Cost of sales and inventory     Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ( FIFO ) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments. 
    
  Equity method investments       We use the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions. 
    
  We evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee s financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.

Pension and postretirement benefits     We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our non-U.S. employees. We also have a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants  status, date of hire and or length of service. Our pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. In determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $354 million to our pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $21 million. 
    
  Our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. Our postretirement healthcare plan is not funded. 
    
  Income taxes     We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
    
  In determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS 
  The following table lists the Company s contractual obligations and commitments at   August 31, 2018   (in millions): 

* 
    Recorded on balance sheet. 
               1   
    Amounts do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes, where appropriate. These expenses     were $532 million for th  e fiscal year ended   August 31, 2018  . 
                3   
    Amounts do not include provisional one-time transition tax liability as a result of the U.S. tax law changes. The Company recorded a provisional one-time transition tax expense of $750 million during the fiscal year 2018.  The Company will make an election to pay the transition tax liability in installments over eight years and, therefore, $682 million of the resulting income taxes liability was recorded as noncurrent income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2018. 
       
  The information in the foregoing table is presented as of   August 31, 2018   and accordingly does not reflect obligations under agreements the Company entered into after that date.  

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  The Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, the Company does not have significant exposure to any off-balance sheet arrangements. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement  generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. 
    
  At   August 31, 2018  , the Company has issued   $218 million   in letters of credit, primarily related to insurance obligations. The Company also had   $45 million   of guarantees outstanding at   August 31, 2018  . The Company remains secondarily liable on   16   leases. The maximum potential undiscounted future payments related to these leases was   $22 million   at   August 31, 2018  .

Item 7A.  Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
  Interest rate risk 
  The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Primary exposures include LIBOR and commercial paper rates. From time to time, the Company uses interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. 
    
  Information regarding our transactions are set forth in note   8  ,   financial instruments  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On   August 31, 2018  , the Company had no material long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts. 
    
  Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
  The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British pound sterling and Euro,     and certain other foreign currencies, which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions).  
    
  The Company s foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivative held as of   August 31, 2018  , by approximately $21 million. The foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. 
    
  Equity price risk 
  Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in note   5  ,   equity method investments  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See  -- AmerisourceBergen Corporation relationship  above.

WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note   1  .    Summary of major accounting policies 
  Organization 
  Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries are a global, pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through   three   reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. See note   16  ,   segment reporting  , for further information. 
    
  Basis of presentation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. The Company uses the equity-method of accounting for equity investments in less than majority-owned companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ. 
    
  The influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, changes in laws and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Company s operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables, which generally settle within   two   to   seven   business days, of   $127 million   and   $98 million   were included in cash and cash equivalents at   August 31, 2018   and   2017  , respectively. 
    
  Restricted cash 
  The Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations. At   August 31, 2018   and   2017  , the amount of such restricted cash was   $190 million   and   $202 million  , respectively, and is reported in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Accounts receivable 
  Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily consist of trade receivables due from customers, including amounts due from third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies), clients and members. Trade receivables were   $5.4 billion   and   $5.5 billion   at   August 31, 2018   and   August 31, 2017  , respectively. Other accounts receivable balances, which consist primarily of receivables from vendors and manufacturers, including receivables from AmerisourceBergen (see note   17  ,   related parties  ), were   $1.2 billion   and   $1.1 billion   at   August 31, 2018   and   August 31, 2017  , respectively. 
    
  Charges to allowance for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts at   August 31, 2018   and   August 31, 2017   was   $75 million   and   $158 million  , respectively. 
    
  Inventories 
  The Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, overhead costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense. 
    
  The Company s Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out ( LIFO ) method. The total carrying value of the segment inventory accounted for under the LIFO method was   $6.7 billion   and   $5.9 billion   at   August 31, 2018   and   2017  , respectively. At   August 31, 2018   and   2017  , Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory would have been greater by   $3.0 billion  , if they had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out ( FIFO ) cost and net realizable value. 

-   63   - 

     Table of Contents  

The Company s Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments  inventory is primarily accounted for using the FIFO method. The total carrying value of the inventory for Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments was   $2.8 billion   and   $3.0 billion   at   August 31, 2018   and   2017  , respectively. 
    
  Property, plant and equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Leasehold improvements, equipment under capital lease and capital lease properties are amortized over their respective estimate of useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The majority of the Company s fixtures and equipment uses the composite method of depreciation. Therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating location is closed, substantially remodeled or impaired. The following table summarizes the Company s property, plant and equipment (in millions) and estimated useful lives (in years): 

The Company capitalizes application development stage costs for internally developed software. These costs are amortized over a   three   to   eight   year period. Amortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was   $254 million   in fiscal   2018  ,   $245 million   in fiscal   2017   and   $238 million   in fiscal   2016  . Unamortized costs at   August 31, 2018   and   2017   were   $1.5 billion   and   $895 million  , respectively. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense for property, plant and equipment including capitalized system development costs and software was   $1.4 billion   in fiscal   2018  ,   $1.3 billion   in fiscal   2017   and   $1.3 billion   in fiscal   2016  . 
    
  Leases 
  Initial terms for leased premises in the U.S. are typically   15   to   25   years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at   five  -year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a portion of sales. 
    
  Capital leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a capital lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.  
    
  See note   4  ,   leases  , for further information. 
    
  Business combinations 
  The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. If the Company obtains new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
    
  Goodwill and other intangible assets 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value. 

-   64   - 

     Table of Contents  

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company s impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. 
    
  Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. See note   6  ,   goodwill and other intangible assets  , for additional disclosure regarding the Company s intangible assets. 
    
  Equity method investments 
  The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company s ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions. 
    
  The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee s financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified. 
    
  See note   5  ,   equity method investments  , for further information. 
    
  Financial instruments 
  The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and currency risks arising from operating and financing activities. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  Derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies: 

Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same line item, generally interest expense, net. 
                
    Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings and is presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. 
                
    Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations. 
                
    Changes in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
     Cash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item. 
  
   -   65   - 

     Table of Contents  

For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between   80%   and   125%   of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. 
    
  Liabilities for facility closings 
  The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. The liability for facility closings, including locations closed under the Company s restructuring actions, was   $964 million   as of   August 31, 2018   and   $718 million   as of   August 31, 2017  . See note   4  ,   leases  , for further information. 
    
  Pension and postretirement benefits 
  The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants  status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. See note   13  ,   retirement benefits  , for further information. 
    
  Noncontrolling interests 
  The Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports the portion of its earnings or loss for noncontrolling interest as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 
    
  Currency 
  Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are generally included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For all periods presented, there were no material operational gains or losses from foreign currency transactions. 
    
  Commitments and contingencies 
  On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company s assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Management s assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management s assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving

these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved. See note   10  ,   commitments and contingencies  , for further information. 
    
  Revenue recognition 
  Revenue is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Company s reportable segments. 
    
  Retail Pharmacy USA and Retail Pharmacy International 
  The Company recognizes revenue, net of taxes and estimated returns, at the time it sells merchandise or dispenses prescription drugs to the customer. Returns are estimated using historical experience. The Company initially estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) for dispensing prescription drugs. The estimates are based on historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts. 
    
  Pharmaceutical Wholesale 
  Wholesale revenue is recognized, net of taxes, upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery. When the Company acts in the capacity of an agent or a logistics service provider, revenue is the fee received for the service and is recognized when the services have been performed. 
    
  Cost of sales 
  Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. 
    
  Vendor allowances and supplier rebates 
  Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors  products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors  products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. 
    
  Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier s products purchased by the Company. 
    
  Loyalty programs 
  The Company s loyalty rewards programs are accrued as a charge to cost of sales at the time a point is earned. Points are funded internally and through vendor participation and are credited to cost of sales at the time a vendor-sponsored point is earned. Breakage is recorded as points expire as a result of a member s inactivity or if the points remain unredeemed after a certain period in accordance with the terms of the loyalty rewards program. Breakage income, which is reported in cost of sales, was not significant in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters  expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances), wholesale warehousing costs and insurance. 
    
  Advertising costs 
  Advertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were   $665 million   in fiscal   2018  ,   $571 million   in fiscal   2017   and   $598 million   in fiscal   2016  . 
    
  Impairment of long-lived assets 
  The Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset or asset group may be impaired. Once identified, the amount of the impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value, which is primarily based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. Impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were   $57 million   in fiscal   2018  . Impairment charges recognized in fiscal   2017   and   2016   were   $234 million   and   $305 million  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

Stock compensation plans 
  Stock based compensation is measured at fair value at the grant date. The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units to the Company s non-employee directors, officers and employees. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive service period. See note   12  ,   stock compensation plans  , for more information on the Company s stock-based compensation plans. 
    
  Warrants 
  Until their exercise in fiscal 2016, the warrants to acquire shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation were accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company reports its warrants at fair value within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of warrants are recognized in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. A deferred credit from the day-one valuation attributable to the warrants granted to Walgreens was amortized over the life of the warrants. See note   8  ,   financial instruments  , for additional disclosure regarding the Company s warrants. 
    
  Insurance 
  The Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Company s U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers  compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Company s estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. 
    
  Income taxes 
  The Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. 
    
  In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. 
    
  The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. 
    
  Earnings per share 
  The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares. Outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled   10.1 million  ,   3.9 million   and   2.5 million   in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.

   -   68   - 

     Table of Contents  

Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU expands an entity s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components and reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. It eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance during the third fiscal quarter of 2018. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
    
  Measurement of inventory 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at  the lower of cost and net realizable value  rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis at the beginning of fiscal 2018 and adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
    
  New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
  Intangibles   goodwill and other   internal-use software 
  In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other- Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40). This ASU addresses customer s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract and also adds certain disclosure requirements related to implementation costs incurred for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Compensation   retirement benefits   defined benefit plans 
  In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement benefits (Topic 715-20). This ASU amends ASC 715 to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost over the next year. The ASU also removes the disclosure requirements for the effects of a one-percentage-point change on the assumed health care costs and the effect of this change in rates on service cost, interest cost and the benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits. This ASU is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 (fiscal 2022) and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial position. 
    
  Fair value measurement 
  In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). The ASU eliminates such disclosures as the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any eliminated or modified disclosures. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's disclosures. 
    
  Compensation   stock compensation 
  In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This ASU eliminated most of the differences between accounting guidance for share-based compensation granted to nonemployees and the guidance for share-based compensation granted to employees. The ASU supersedes the guidance for nonemployees and expands the scope of the guidance for employees to include both. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those years. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial position. 
    
  Accounting for reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income 
  
   -   69   - 

     Table of Contents  

In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU addresses the income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) which were originally recognized in other comprehensive income, rather than in income from continuing operations. Specifically, it permits a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for the adjustment of deferred taxes due to the reduction of the historical corporate income tax rate to the newly enacted corporate income tax rate resulting from the U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017. It also requires certain disclosures about these reclassifications. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied either on a prospective basis in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the U.S. tax law changes are recognized. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company s financial position. 
    
  Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
  In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost in the same line item in the statement of earnings as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the related employees during the period. The other net cost components are required to be presented in the statement of earnings separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. Additionally, the line item used in the statement of earnings to present the other net cost components must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). 
    
  Restricted cash 
  In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the Statement of Cash Flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Company s Statement of Cash Flows. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). 
    
  Tax accounting for intra-entity asset transfers 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. Topic 740, Income Taxes, prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. In addition, interpretations of this guidance have developed in practice for transfers of certain intangible and tangible assets. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in GAAP. To more faithfully represent the economics of intra-entity asset transfers, the amendments in this ASU require that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments in this ASU do not change GAAP for the pre-tax effects of an intra-entity asset transfer under Topic 810, Consolidation, or for an intra-entity transfer of inventory. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment recognized directly to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). 
    
  Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period  
  
   -   70   - 

     Table of Contents  

and the new guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Company s Statement of Cash Flows. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). 
    
  Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. Subsequently, the FASB has issued additional ASUs which further clarify this guidance. This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by requiring the capitalization of substantially all leases on the balance sheet and disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. Under this new guidance, at the lease commencement date, a lessee recognizes a right- of-use asset and lease liability, which is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments. For income statement purposes, a dual model was retained for lessees, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Under the operating lease model, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Under the finance lease model, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years. In transition, lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented (fiscal 2018) using a modified retrospective approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. In July 2018, a new ASU was issued to provide relief to the companies from restating the comparative period. Pursuant to this ASU, WBA will not restate comparative periods presented in the Company s financial statements in the period of adoption. 
    
  The Company will adopt this ASU on September 1, 2019 (fiscal 2020). The Company has begun evaluating and planning for adoption and implementation of this ASU, including implementing a new global lease accounting system, evaluating practical expedient and accounting policy elections and assessing the overall financial statement impact. This ASU will have a material impact on the Company s financial position. The impact on the Company s results of operations is being evaluated. The impact of this ASU is non-cash in nature and will not affect the Company s cash flows. 
    
  Classification and measurement of financial instruments 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Subsequently, the FASB has issued additional ASUs which further clarify this guidance. This ASU requires equity investments (except those under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of an investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, if any, and changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. This simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments previous held at cost. Separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category is required. This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted, for fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis, with the exception of the amendments related to the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which must be applied on a prospective basis. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). 
    
  Revenue recognition on contracts with customers 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU provides a single principles-based revenue recognition model with a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Subsequently, the FASB has issued additional ASUs which further clarify this guidance and also defer the effective date by one year to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will use the modified retrospective method as the transition approach when adopting this new accounting guidance on September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, the related amendments and the interpretive guidance on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and will be limited to immaterial changes to recognition of revenues related to loyalty programs and gift cards, in addition to disaggregated revenue disclosures. Specifically, the Company currently uses the cost approach to account for loyalty programs. Upon adoption, the Company will use the deferred revenue approach. Additionally, gift card breakage currently is recognized at point of sale by the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and upon expiration primarily within the Retail Pharmacy International segment. Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, all breakage will be recognized based on the pattern in which the

customer redeems the gift cards. 

Note   2  .    Acquisitions 
  Acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets 
  On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase   1,932   stores,   three   distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for   $4.375 billion   in cash and other consideration. The purchases of these stores have been accounted for as business combinations and occurred in waves during fiscal 2018. The Company purchased   1,932   stores for total cash consideration of   $4.2 billion   for the fiscal year ended   August 31, 2018  . The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining   two   distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement.  
    
  As of   August 31, 2018  , the Company had not completed the analysis to assign fair values to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and therefore the purchase price allocation has not been finalized. The preliminary purchase price allocation will be subject to further refinement and may result in material changes as the Company is awaiting additional information to complete its assessment. During the twelve months ended   August 31, 2018  , the Company recorded certain measurement period adjustments based on additional information primarily to deferred income taxes, other non-current liabilities and inventories, which did not have a material impact on goodwill. The following table summarizes the consideration for the purchases and the preliminary amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the fiscal year ended   August 31, 2018  . 

The preliminary identified definite-lived intangible assets were as follows: 

Consideration includes cash of   $4,157 million   and the fair value of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Company s group purchasing organization, Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH. The fair value for this option was determined using the income approach methodology.  The fair value estimates are based on the market compensation for such services and appropriate discount rate, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values. 
    
  The goodwill of   $1,344 million   arising from the business combinations primarily reflects the expected operational synergies and cost savings generated from the Store Optimization Program as well as the expected growth from new customers. See note   3  ,   exit and disposal activities  , for additional information. The goodwill was allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
    
  The fair value for customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. Real property fair values were determined using primarily the income approach and sales comparison approach. The fair value measurements of the intangible assets are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The fair value estimates for the intangible assets are based on projected discounted cash flows,

historical and projected financial information and attrition rates, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values. 
    
  The following table presents supplemental unaudited condensed pro forma consolidated sales for the fiscal years ended   2018   and   2017   as if all   1,932   stores were acquired on September 1, 2016. Pro forma net earnings of the Company, assuming these purchases had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. See note   3  ,   exit and disposal activities  , for additional information. The unaudited condensed pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of what the Company s results would have been had the purchases occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or results which may occur in the future.

The   1,932   Rite Aid stores acquired did not have a material impact on net earnings of the Company for the fiscal year ended   2018  . 
    
  AllianceRx Walgreens Prime 
  On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC ( Prime ) closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition of Prime s specialty pharmacy and mail services business as a business combination involving noncash purchase consideration of   $720 million   consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in AllianceRx Walgreens Prime. 
    
  The Company has completed the purchase accounting for the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime transaction. The following table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the transaction (in millions).

The identified intangible assets primarily include payer contracts. These contracts are estimated to have a weighted average useful life of   15   years. The goodwill of   $103 million   arising from the transaction consists of expected purchasing synergies, operating efficiencies by benchmarking performance and applying best practices across the combined company, consolidation of operations, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and combining workforces. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

  Store Optimization Program 
  On October 24, 2017, the Company s Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the  Store Optimization Program ) as part of an initiative to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately   600   stores and related assets within the Company s Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and are expected to take place over an   18   month period. 
    
  The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately   $450 million  , including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately   $270 million   for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately   $180 million   for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures.

AmerisourceBergen Corporation ( AmerisourceBergen ) investment 
  As of   August 31, 2018   and   2017  , the Company owned   56,854,867   AmerisourceBergen common shares, representing approximately   26%   of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock. The Company accounts for its equity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings attributable to the Company s investment being classified within the operating income of its Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen, the Company accounts for this equity method investment on a financial reporting lag of two months. Equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen are reported as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Level 1 fair market value of the Company s equity investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock at   August 31, 2018   was   $5.1 billion  . 
    
  As of   August 31, 2018  , the Company s investment in AmerisourceBergen carrying value exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of AmerisourceBergen by   $4.3 billion  . This premium of   $4.3 billion   was recognized as part of the carrying value in the Company s equity investment in AmerisourceBergen. The difference was primarily related to goodwill and the fair value of AmerisourceBergen intangible assets.

During the fiscal year ended   August 31, 2018  , the Company recorded an impairment of   $170 million   in its equity interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, which was included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The fair value of the Company s equity interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals was determined using the proposed sale price and thus represents Level 3 measurement. During the fiscal year ended   August 31, 2018  , the Company completed the sale of a   30 percent   interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals to its joint venture partner Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings resulting in a   $172 million   reduction in carrying value and a   $8 million   cumulative translation adjustment loss.

Note   6  .    Goodwill and other intangible assets 
  The fair values of the Company s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately   11%   to approximately   312%  . The fair value of the Boots reporting unit, within the Retail Pharmacy International segment, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately   11%  . The Company will continue to monitor the UK industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the Boots reporting unit. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both.

Other current liabilities 

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure associated with some of its fixed-rate borrowings and designates them as fair value hedges. From time to time, the Company uses forward starting interest rates swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure of some of its anticipated debt issuance.  
    
  The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant committed and highly probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company has significant non-US dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk. 
    
  Fair value hedges 
  The Company holds an interest rate swap converting   $250 million   of its   5.250%   fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the six-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread. All swap termination dates coincide with the notes  maturity date, January 15, 2019. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges. 
    
  The gains and losses due to changes in fair value on the swaps and on the hedged notes attributable to interest rate risk did not have a material impact on the Company s Financial Statements. The changes in fair value of the Company s debt that was

  Derivatives credit risk 
  Counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance, and the Company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty. 
    
  Derivatives offsetting 
  The Company does not offset the fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Note   9  .    Fair value measurements 
  The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad Levels: 
    
           Level 1 - 
    Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. 
              Level 2 - 
    Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. 
              Level 3 - 
    Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): 

1   
    Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor. 
                3   
    The fair value of forward currency contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current available forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable market rates. 
               4   
    The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the applicable observable yield curves. See note   8  ,   financial instruments  , for additional information. 
       
  There were   no   transfers between Levels in fiscal   2018   or   2017  . 
    
  The Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Company s debt in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless otherwise noted, the fair value for all notes was determined based upon quoted market prices and therefore categorized as Level 1. See note   7  ,   debt  , for further information. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. 

Note   10  .    Commitments and contingencies 
  The Company is involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Company s business, including the matters described below. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. The Company also may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties. In such actions, the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments, allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. 
    
  The results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit, and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position. However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do  
  
   -   83   - 

     Table of Contents  

sometimes occur. As a result, the Company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. 
    
  On December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co., and Walgreen Co. as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On April 10, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of a securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015. After a ruling issued on September 30, 2016 in the securities class action, which is described below, on November 3, 2016, the Court entered a stipulation and order extending the stay until the securities case is fully resolved.

On June 16, 2015, the Court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff. Pursuant to the Court s order, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on August 17, 2015, and defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 16, 2015. On September 30, 2016, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants  motion to dismiss. Defendants filed their answer to the amended complaint on November 4, 2016 and filed an amended answer on January 16, 2017. Plaintiff filed its motion for class certification on April 21, 2017. The Court granted plaintiff s motion on March 29, 2018 and merits discovery is proceeding. 
    
  As of August 31, 2017, the Company was aware of   two   putative class action lawsuits filed by purported Rite Aid stockholders against Rite Aid and its board of directors, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc. for claims arising out of the transactions contemplated by the original Merger Agreement (prior to its amendment on January 29, 2017) (such transactions, the  Rite Aid Transactions ).   One   Rite Aid action was filed in the State of Pennsylvania in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (the  Pennsylvania action ), and   one   action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the  federal action ). The Pennsylvania action primarily alleged that the Rite Aid board of directors breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions by, among other things, agreeing to an unfair and inadequate price, agreeing to deal protection devices that preclude other bidders from making successful competing offers for Rite Aid, and failing to disclose all allegedly material information concerning the proposed merger, and also alleged that Walgreens Boots Alliance and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc. aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. There has been no activity in this lawsuit since the complaint was filed. The federal action alleged, among other things, that Rite Aid and its board of directors disseminated an allegedly false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions. The plaintiffs in the federal action also filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Rite Aid shareholder vote relating to the Rite Aid Transactions. That motion was denied, and the matter was stayed. On March 17, 2017, plaintiffs moved to lift the stay to allow plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. That motion was granted, and plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on December 11, 2017, alleging that the Company and certain of its officers made false or misleading statements regarding the Rite Aid Transactions. On July 11, 2018, the Court denied the Company s motion to dismiss, but narrowed the time scope of the subject statements. The Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses on August 8, 2018, and on August 24, 2018 filed a new motion to dismiss based on the named plaintiff s lack of standing. 
    
  The Company was also named as a defendant in   eight   putative class action lawsuits filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the  Delaware actions ). Those actions were consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Rite Aid shareholder vote relating to the Rite Aid Transactions. That motion was denied and the plaintiffs in the Delaware actions agreed to settle this matter for an immaterial amount. The Delaware actions all have been dismissed. 
    
  In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes and others, alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation, captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in a subset of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. The Company also has been named as a defendant in several lawsuits brought in state courts relating to opioid matters. The relief sought by various plaintiffs is compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief. Additionally, the Company has received from the Attorney Generals of several states subpoenas, civil investigative demands, and/or other requests concerning opioid matters. 
    
  On September 28, 2018, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with the SEC to fully resolve an investigation into certain forward-looking financial goals and related disclosures by Walgreens. The disclosures at issue were

made prior to the strategic combination with Alliance Boots and the merger pursuant to which Walgreens Boots Alliance became the parent holding company on December 31, 2014. The settlement does not involve any of the Company s current officers or executives, nor does it allege intentional or reckless conduct by the Company. In agreeing to the settlement, the Company neither admitted nor denied the SEC s allegations. Pursuant to the agreement with the SEC, the Company consented to the SEC s issuance of an administrative order, and the Company paid a   $34.5 million   penalty, which was fully reserved for in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements as of August 31, 2018. 
    
  The Company has been responding to a civil investigation involving allegations under the False Claims Act by a United States Attorney s Office, working in conjunction with several states, regarding certain dispensing practices. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses against any action that might be brought against it. The Company is cooperating with this investigation, has entered into discussions with the government concerning a potential resolution of the matter, and has established reserves in relation to such a potential resolution.  

Note   11  .    Income taxes 
  U.S. tax law changes 
  The United States government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in December 2017. The accounting guidance on income taxes generally requires the effects of new tax legislation to be recognized in the period of enactment. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118 ), which provides for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date for companies to complete their accounting for the U.S. tax law changes. In accordance with the SEC staff guidance, companies must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the U.S. tax law changes for which the accounting is complete. To the extent a company s accounting for the income tax effect of certain provisions of the U.S. tax law changes is incomplete but the Company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, a provisional estimate must be recorded in the Company s financial statements. If companies cannot determine a provisional estimate for the effects of an aspect of the U.S. tax law changes, they should continue applying the accounting guidance on income taxes on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws in effect immediately before the U.S. tax law changes were enacted. 
    
  The U.S. tax law changes include broad and complex changes affecting the Company s fiscal 2018 results. Among other things, the U.S. tax law changes reduce the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and require companies to immediately accrue for a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over an eight year period. The U.S. tax law changes modify the taxation of foreign earnings, repeal of the deduction for domestic production activities, limit interest deductibility and establish a global intangible low tax income (GILTI) regime. 
    
  The lower corporate income tax rate of 21% became effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately   26%   for fiscal 2018 and   21%   for subsequent fiscal years, which provided a benefit to the Company s fiscal 2018 tax provision of approximately   $307 million  . 
    
  In connection with the Company s ongoing analysis of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, which is provisional and subject to change, the Company recorded a net tax   benefit   of   $125 million   during fiscal   2018  . This provisional net tax   benefit   arises from a benefit of   $648 million   from re-measuring the Company s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by the Company s accrual for the transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes of   $523 million  . The Company s estimated accrual for transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes decreased from   $679 million   as at May 31, 2018 to   $523 million   as at   August 31, 2018   due to additional foreign tax credits and refinement of the Company s estimated impact of tax law changes. 
    
  Based on the effective dates of certain aspects of the U.S. tax law changes as well as estimated data required to be used in the corresponding measurement calculations, the Company s analysis of the income tax effects of the U.S. tax law changes could not be finalized as of   August 31, 2018  . While the Company made reasonable estimates of the impact of the transition tax and the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, the final impact of the U.S. tax law changes may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in its interpretations and assumptions, technical clarifications from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS and actions the Company may take. The Company expects to finalize such provisional amounts within the time period prescribed by SAB 118. The U.S. tax law changes created new rules that allow the Company to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in taxable income as either a current period expense or reflect such inclusions related to temporary basis differences in the Company s measurement of deferred taxes. The Company s analysis of the new GILTI rules is not complete; therefore, the Company has not made a policy election regarding the tax accounting treatment of the GILTI tax. 
    
  The U.S. tax law changes have the potential to change the Company s assertions with respect to whether earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries should remain indefinitely reinvested. The Company continues to evaluate these changes, therefore, the Company has not made any changes to its indefinite reinvestment assertions.

As of   August 31, 2018  , the Company has recorded deferred tax assets for tax attributes of   $2.4 billion  , primarily reflecting the benefit of   $426 million   in U.S. federal,   $43 million   in state and   $8.5 billion   in non-U.S. ordinary and capital losses. In addition, these deferred tax assets include   $58 million   of income tax credits. Of these deferred tax assets,   $2.1 billion   will expire at various dates from 2019 through 2035. The residual deferred tax assets of   $227 million   have no expiry date. 
    
  The Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of   $2.2 billion   against those deferred tax assets as of   August 31, 2018  . 
    
  Income taxes paid, net of refunds were   $0.6 billion  ,   $1.1 billion   and   $1.1 billion   for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
    
  ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of   August 31, 2018  , unrecognized tax benefits of   $482 million   were reported as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while   $61 million   were reported as current tax liabilities. Both of these amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable. 
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

     Table of Contents  

At   August 31, 2018  ,   2017   and   2016  ,   $331 million  ,   $286 million   and   $237 million  , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next   twelve   months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to   $24 million   due to anticipated tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple tax jurisdictions. 
    
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At   August 31, 2018   and   August 31, 2017  , the Company had accrued interest and penalties of   $87 million   and   $43 million  , respectively. For the   year ended August 31, 2018  , the amount reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties was   $44 million  . 
                                                    
  The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examinations for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2014. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2007. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in Luxembourg prior to 2013, in Germany prior to 2014, in France prior to 2008 and in Turkey prior to 2014. With respect to the United Kingdom, a number of specific issues remain open to examination by the tax authorities back to 2000. 
                                                   
  The Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays are expected to extend through September 2022. The holidays had a beneficial impact of   $127 million   and   $142 million   during fiscal   2018   and   2017  , respectively. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above. 
    
  At   August 31, 2018  , it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration. 

Note   12  .    Stock compensation plans 
  The Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  Omnibus Plan ) which became effective in fiscal 2013, provides for incentive compensation to the Company s non-employee directors, officers and employees and consolidates several previously existing equity compensation plans into a single plan. 
    
  The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units under the Omnibus Plan. Performance shares issued under the Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive awards and equity-based awards to key employees. The fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at   100 percent  . If such goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any recognized compensation expense is reversed. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with performance requirements that are granted to key employees. The performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability. 
                                                    
  Total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016   was   $130 million  ,   $91 million   and   $115 million  , respectively. The recognized tax benefit was   $43 million  ,   $78 million   and   $21 million   for fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at   August 31, 2018   was   $147 million  , which will be recognized over   three years  . 

Note   13  .    Retirement benefits 
  The Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan. 
    
  Defined benefit pension plans (non-U.S. plans) 
  The Company has various defined benefit pension plans outside the United States. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan (the  Boots Plan ), which covers certain employees in the United Kingdom. The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010, with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis. 
    
  The investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold approximately   85%   of its assets in a diverse portfolio which aims to broadly match the characteristics of the plan s liabilities by investing in bonds, derivatives and other fixed income assets, with the remainder invested in predominantly return-seeking assets. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management.

    Equity securities, which mainly comprise investments in commingled funds, are valued based on quoted prices and are primarily exchange-traded. Securities for which official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are classified as Level 1 investments. If closing prices are not available, or the investments are in a commingled fund, 
     securities are valued at the last quoted bid price and typically are categorized as Level 2 investments. 
            2   
    Debt securities: government bonds comprise fixed interest and index linked bonds issued by central governments and are valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize pricing which considers readily available inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type, as well as dealer-supplied prices. Government bonds are classified as Level 2 investments.  
               3   
    Debt securities: corporate bonds comprise bonds issued by corporations in both segregated and commingled funds  
     and are valued using recently executed transactions, or quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. Corporate bonds are categorized as Level 2 investments. 
            4   
    Real estate comprises investments in certain property funds which are valued based on the underlying properties. These properties are valued using a number of standard industry techniques such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Real estate investments are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in

            5   
    Other investments mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and direct private placements. Cash is categorized as a Level 1 investment and cash in commingled funds is categorized as Level 2 investments. Cash equivalents are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Derivatives which are exchange-traded and for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market, or exchange on which they are traded, and are categorized as Level 1 investments. Over-the-counter derivatives typically are valued by independent pricing services and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Direct private placements are typically bonds valued by reference to comparable bonds and are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in Level 3 investments during fiscal   2018   were primarily driven by purchases during the year.

  Defined contribution plans 
  The principal retirement plan for U.S. employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing Retirement Trust, to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The Company s contribution is in the form of a guaranteed match which is approved annually by the Walgreen Co. Board of Directors and reviewed by the Compensation Committee and Finance Committee of the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision was an expense of   $217 million  ,   $221 million   and   $226 million   in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. The Company s contributions were   $366 million  , $  220 million   and $  225 million   in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
    
  The Company also has certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is the Alliance Healthcare   Boots Retirement Savings Plan, which is United Kingdom based and to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was   $142 million   in fiscal   2018  ,   $112 million   in fiscal   2017   and   $130 million   in fiscal   2016  .

The Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. An amendment to this plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 resulted in a reduction in the benefit plan obligation of   $201 million   and the recognition of a curtailment gain of   $112 million  . An amendment during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 resulted in the recognition of a curtailment gain of   $109 million  . The Company s postretirement health benefit plan obligation was   $146 million   and   $361 million   in fiscal   2018   and   2017   respectively and is not funded. The expected benefit to be paid net of the estimated federal subsidy during fiscal year   2019   is   $11 million  . 

Note   14  .    Capital stock 
  In connection with the Company s capital policy, the Board of Directors has authorized share repurchase programs. In April 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the  April 2017 stock repurchase program ), which authorized the repurchase of up to   $1.0 billion   of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the program s expiration on December 31, 2017. In May 2017, the Company completed the April 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing   11.8 million   shares. In June 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to   $5.0 billion   of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the program s expiration on August 31, 2018, which authorization was increased by an additional   $1.0 billion   in October 2017 (as expanded, the  June 2017 stock repurchase program ). The June 2017 stock repurchase program was completed in October 2017. In June 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to   $10.0 billion   of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock, which program has no specified expiration date. The Company purchased   72 million   and   59 million   shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal   2018   and   2017   at a cost of   $4.9 billion   and   $4.8 billion  , respectively. 
    
  The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. 
    
  In addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling   $289 million   were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal   2018   as compared to   $457 million   and   $1 billion   in fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  , respectively. At   August 31, 2018  ,   33 million   shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the Company s various employee benefit plans.

Note   16  .    Segment reporting 
  The Company has aligned its operations into   three   reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company s Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company s operating segments. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources, therefore the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included. 

The Retail Pharmacy USA segment consists of the Walgreens business, which includes the operation of retail drugstores, convenient care clinics and mail and central specialty pharmacy services. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty and personal care and consumables and general merchandise.  
                
    The Retail Pharmacy International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses and optical practices. These businesses include Boots branded stores in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty and personal care and other consumer products.

The Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment consists of the Alliance Healthcare pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses and an equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Wholesale operations are located in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Turkey, Spain, the Netherlands, Egypt, Norway, Romania, Czech Republic and Lithuania. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the wholesaling and distribution of a comprehensive offering of brand-name pharmaceuticals (including specialty pharmaceutical products) and generic pharmaceuticals, health and beauty products, home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to pharmacies and other healthcare providers. 
     The results of operations for each reportable segment includes procurement benefits and an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. The  Eliminations  column contains items not allocable to the reportable segments, as the information is not utilized by the chief operating decision maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources.

Management s Report on Internal Control 
    
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As permitted by the SEC, our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting excludes internal control over financial reporting of equity method investees. However, our assessment of internal control over financial reporting with respect to equity method investees did include controls over the recording of amounts related to our investment that are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including controls over the selection of accounting methods for our investments, the recognition of equity method earnings and losses and the determination, valuation and recording of our investment account balances. 
    
  Additionally, the scope of management s evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting of the acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets ( Rite Aid ) as described in note   2  ,   acquisitions  , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC Staff s general guidance that an assessment of a business may be omitted from management s report on internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018. The acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets represented approximately 4% of the Company s total assets as of August 31, 2018 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded and 4% of the Company s net sales for the year ended August 31, 2018. 
    
  Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   August 31, 2018  . Deloitte   Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in its report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  
    
  Opinion on the Financial Statements 
    
  We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
    
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 11, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Basis for Opinion 
    
  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 
    
  Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of August 31, 2018, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by COSO.  
    
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated October 11, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  
    
  As described in Management s Report on Internal Control, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of certain assets acquired from Rite Aid Corporation ( Rite Aid ) which were acquired during the year ended August 31, 2018. The certain assets acquired from Rite Aid represented approximately 4% of the Company s total assets as of August 31, 2018 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded and 4% of the Company s net sales for the year ended August 31, 2018. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting for the certain assets acquired from Rite Aid. 
    
  Basis for Opinion  
    
  The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
    
  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9A.  Controls and procedures 
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
  Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ). As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company had acquired 1,932 stores from Rite Aid. The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired Rite Aid stores. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management's assessment for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Report on internal control over financial reporting 
  Management s report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Deloitte   Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated in this Item 9A by reference. 
    
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
  In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2018 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the acquisition of Rite Aid stores, the Company has incorporated internal controls over significant processes specific to the acquisition that it believes to be appropriate and necessary in consideration of the level of related integration. As the post-closing integration continues, the Company will continue to review such internal controls and processes and may take further steps to integrate such controls and processes with those of the Company. 
    
  Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 
  Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

  This document (referred to below as this "Agreement") spells out the terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Unit Award (the "Award") granted to you by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan") on and as of the Grant Date designated above.  Except as otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the respective meanings set forth in the Plan.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Employer" means the entity (the Company or the Affiliate) that employs you on the applicable date.  The Plan, as it may be amended from time to time, is incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.   
  You and the Company agree as follows: 
  1.  Grant of Restricted Stock Units  .  Pursuant to the approval and direction of the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee"), the Company hereby grants you the number of Restricted Stock Units specified above (the "Restricted Stock Units"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement. 
  2.        Restricted Stock Unit Account and Dividend Equivalents  .  The Company will maintain an account (the "Account") on its books in your name to reflect the number of Restricted Stock Units awarded to you as well as any additional Restricted Stock Units credited as a result of Dividend Equivalents.  The Account will be administered as follows: 
  (a)        The Account is for recordkeeping purposes only, and no assets or other amounts shall be set aside from the Company's general assets with respect to such Account. 
  (b)        As of each record date with respect to which a cash dividend is to be paid with respect to shares of Company common stock par value US$.01 per share ("Stock"), the Company will credit your Account with an equivalent amount of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing the value of the cash dividend that would have been paid on your Restricted Stock Units if they had been shares of Stock, divided by the value of Stock on such date. 
  (c)        If dividends are paid in the form of shares of Stock rather than cash, then your Account will be credited with one additional Restricted Stock Unit for each share of  
  
   1 

(OGRSU18) 

Stock that would have been received as a dividend had your outstanding Restricted Stock Units been shares of Stock. 
  (d)        Additional Restricted Stock Units credited via Dividend Equivalents shall vest or be forfeited at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate.  
  3.        Restricted Period  .  The period prior to the vesting date with respect each Restricted Stock Unit is referred to as the  Restricted Period.   Subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, unless vested or forfeited earlier as described in Section 4, 5, 6 or 7 of this Agreement, as applicable, your Restricted Stock Units will become vested and be settled as described in Section 8 below, as of the vesting date or dates indicated in the introduction to this Agreement, provided the performance goal in this Section 3 ( Performance Goal ) is satisfied in the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.  The Performance Goal is attainment of 50% of Threshold Adjusted Operating Income established as a goal for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018, as determined under the Management Incentive Plan and certified by the Committee.  If the Performance Goal is not attained as of the end of the 2018 fiscal year, the Restricted Stock Units awarded hereunder shall be thereupon forfeited.   
  4.        Disability or Death  .  If during the Restricted Period you have a Termination of Service by reason of Disability or death, then the Restricted Stock Units will become fully vested as of the date of your Termination of Service and the Vesting Date shall become the date of your Termination of Service.  Any Restricted Stock Units becoming vested by reason of your Termination of Service by reason of Disability or death shall be settled as provided in Section 8. 
  5.        Retirement  .  If within 12 months of a Vesting Date you have a Termination of Service by reason of Retirement, then the Vesting Date shall become the date of your Termination of Service.  Any Restricted Stock Units becoming vested by reason of your Retirement shall be settled as provided in Section 8. 
  6.        Termination of Service Following a Change in Control  .  If during the Restricted Period there is a Change in Control of the Company and within the one-year period thereafter you have a Termination of Service initiated by your Employer other than for Cause (as defined in Section 7), then your Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested, and they shall be settled in accordance with Section 9.  For purposes of this Section 6, a Termination of Service initiated by your Employer shall include a Termination of Employment for Good Reason under - and pursuant to the terms and conditions of   the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, but only to the extent applicable to you as an eligible participant in such Plan. 
  7.        Other Termination of Service  .  If during the Restricted Period you have a voluntary or involuntary Termination of Service for any reason other than as set forth in Section 4, 5 or 6 above or Section 9 below, as determined by the Committee, then you shall thereupon forfeit any Restricted Stock Units that are still in a Restricted Period on your termination date.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means any one or more of the following, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion: 
    
  (a)    your commission of a felony or any crime of moral turpitude; 
    
  (b)    your dishonesty or material violation of standards of integrity in the course of fulfilling your duties to the Company or any Affiliate;  
  
   2 

(OGRSU18) 

(c)    your material violation of a material written policy of the Company or any Affiliate violation of which is grounds for immediate termination;  
    
  (d)    your willful and deliberate failure to perform your duties to the Company or any Affiliate in any material respect, after reasonable notice of such failure and an opportunity to correct it; or  
    
  (e)    your failure to comply in any material respect with the United States ("U.S.") Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and the U.S. Truth in Negotiations Act, or any rules or regulations thereunder. 
  8.        Settlement of Vested Restricted Stock Units  .  Subject to the requirements of Section 13 below, as promptly as practicable after the applicable Vesting Date, whether occurring upon your Separation from Service or otherwise, but in no event later than 75 days after the Vesting Date, the Company shall transfer to you one share of Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit becoming vested at such time, net of any applicable tax withholding requirements in accordance with Section 10 below; provided, however, that, if you are a Specified Employee at the time of Separation from Service, then to the extent your Restricted Stock Units are deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, settlement of which is triggered by your Separation from Service (other than for death), payment shall not be made until the date which is six months after your Separation from Service.   
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are resident or employed outside of the U.S., the Company, in its sole discretion, may provide for the settlement of the Restricted Stock Units in the form of: 
    
  (a)     a cash payment (in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Stock that corresponds with the number of vested Restricted Stock Units) to the extent that settlement in shares of Stock (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or an Affiliate to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or country of employment, if different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or an Affiliate or (iv) is administratively burdensome; or  
    
  (b)     shares of Stock, but require you to sell such shares of Stock immediately or within a specified period following your Termination of Service (in which case, you hereby agree that the Company shall have the authority to issue sale instructions in relation to such shares of Stock on your behalf). 
  9.        Settlement Following Change in Control  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may, in its sole discretion, fulfill its obligation with respect to all or any portion of the Restricted Stock Units that become vested in accordance with Section 6 above, by: 
  (a)        delivery of (i) the number of shares of Stock that corresponds with the number of Restricted Stock Units that have become vested or (ii) such other ownership interest as  
  
   3 

(OGRSU18) 

such shares of Stock that correspond with the vested Restricted Stock Units may be converted into by virtue of the Change in Control transaction; 
  (b)        payment of cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Stock that corresponds with the number of vested Restricted Stock Units at that time; or 
  (c)        delivery of any combination of shares of Stock (or other converted ownership interest) and cash having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of the Stock that corresponds with the number of Restricted Stock Units that have become vested at that time. 
  Settlement shall be made as soon as practical after the Restricted Stock Units become fully vested under Section 6, but in no event later than 30 days after such date. 
  10.        Responsibility for Taxes; Tax Withholding  .   
  (a)        You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or your Employer, the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ("Tax-Related Items"), is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or your Employer, if any.  You further acknowledge that the Company and/or your Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Award, the subsequent sale of shares of Stock acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any Dividend Equivalents and/or dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you acknowledge that the Company and/or your Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
    
  (b)    Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or your Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, you authorize the Company, your Employer or its agent to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding from the shares of Stock to be delivered upon settlement of the Award that number of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required by law to be withheld. For purposes of the foregoing, no fractional shares of Stock will be withheld or issued pursuant to the grant of the Restricted Stock Units and the issuance of shares of Stock hereunder. 
  The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable statutory minimum withholding rates (as determined by the Company in good faith and in its sole discretion) or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the share equivalent.  As the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding from the shares of Stock to be delivered upon settlement  
  
   4 

(OGRSU18) 

of the Award, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Stock subject to the vested Award, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. 
  You agree to pay to the Company or your Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or your Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares of Stock (or cash payment) or the proceeds from the sale of shares of Stock if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
  11.        Nontransferability  .  During the Restricted Period and thereafter until Stock is transferred to you in settlement thereof, you may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise alienate or hypothecate the Restricted Stock Units whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law, other than by beneficiary designation effective upon your death, or by will or by the laws of intestacy.   
  12.        Rights as Shareholder  .  You shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units until such time as a certificate of stock for the Stock issued in settlement of such Restricted Stock Units has been issued to you or such shares of Stock have been recorded in your name in book entry form. Until that time, you shall not have any voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units.  Except as provided in Section 9 above, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or distributions or other rights with respect to such shares for which the record date is prior to the date on which you become the holder of record thereof.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if a law or any regulation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or of any other body having jurisdiction shall require the Company or you to take any action before shares of Stock can be delivered to you hereunder, then the date of delivery of such shares may be delayed accordingly.   
  13.        Securities Laws  .  If a Registration Statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is not in effect with respect to the shares of Stock to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, you hereby represent that you are acquiring the shares of Stock for investment and with no present intention of selling or transferring them and that you will not sell or otherwise transfer the shares except in compliance with all applicable securities laws and requirements of any stock exchange on which the shares of Stock may then be listed. 
  14.        Not a Public Offering  .  If you are resident outside the U.S., the grant of the Restricted Stock Units is not intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (or country of employment, if different).  The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings with the local securities authorities (unless otherwise required under local law), and the grant of the Restricted Stock Units is not subject to the supervision of the local securities authorities. 
  15.        Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws  .  Your country of residence may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws that may affect your ability to acquire or sell shares of Stock under the Plan during such times you are considered to have "inside information" (as defined in the laws in your country).  These laws may be the same or different from any Company insider trading policy.  You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations, and you are advised to speak to your personal advisor on this matter. 
  
   5 

(OGRSU18) 

16.        Repatriation; Compliance with Law  .  If you are resident or employed outside the U.S., as a condition of the Award, you agree to repatriate all payments attributable to the shares of Stock and/or cash acquired under the Plan in accordance with applicable foreign exchange rules and regulations in your country of residence (and country of employment, if different).  In addition, you agree to take any and all actions, and consent to any and all actions taken by the Company and its Affiliates, as may be required to allow the Company and its Affiliates to comply with local laws, rules and/or regulations in your country of residence (and country of employment, if different).  Finally, you agree to take any and all actions as may be required to comply with your personal obligations under local laws, rules and/or regulations in your country of residence and country of employment, if different). 
  17.        No Advice Regarding Grant  .  No employee of the Company is permitted to advise you regarding your participation in the Plan or your acquisition or sale of the shares of Stock underlying the Restricted Stock Units.  You are hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors before taking any action related to the Plan. 
  18.        Change in Stock  .  In the event of any change in Stock, by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, split-up, merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, or of any similar change affecting Stock, the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee. 
  19.        Nature of the Award  .  In accepting the Award, you acknowledge, understand and agree that: 
  (a)        the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and limited in duration, and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time; 
  (b)        the grant of the Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted in the past;   
  (c)        all decisions with respect to future Awards or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the form and timing of the Award, the number of shares subject to the Award, and the vesting provisions applicable to the Award; 
  (d)        the Award and your participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be interpreted as forming an employment or service contract with the Company or any Affiliate and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, your Employer or an Affiliate, as applicable, to terminate your employment or service relationship; 
  (e)        you are voluntarily participating in the Plan; 
  (f)        the Award and the shares of Stock subject to the Award are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; 
  (g)        the Award, the shares of Stock subject to the Award and the value of same, is an extraordinary item of compensation outside the scope of your employment (and employment contract, if any) and is not part of normal or expected compensation for any

purpose, including, without limitation, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments; 
  (h)        the future value of the shares of Stock underlying the Award is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty; 
  (i)        unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, a Termination of Service shall be effective from the date on which active employment or service ends and shall not be extended by any statutory or common law notice of termination period; 
  (j)        no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Award resulting from a Termination of Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the Award to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, your Employer or any Affiliate, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, the Employer and all Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; 
  (k)        unless otherwise provided herein, in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Award and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Award or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of Stock of the Company; and 
  (l)        neither the Company nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the U.S. dollar that may affect the value of the Award or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Award or the subsequent sale of any shares of Stock acquired upon settlement of the Award.

  22.        Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality  .  As a condition to the receipt of the Award, you must agree to the Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A by executing that Agreement.  Failure to execute and  
  
   8 

(OGRSU18) 

return the Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement within 120 days of the Grant Date shall constitute your decision to decline to accept this Award.

     "Trade Secrets" are a form of intellectual property and may include all tangible and intangible forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs or codes, and may in particular include such things as pricing information, business records, software programs, algorithms, inventions, patent applications, and designs and processes not known outside the Company.  Trade Secrets may be stored, compiled, memorialized or contained in various forms or media, such as paper, electronic media or transmission (such as disc, email, file transfers, tape, or web site features), all other forms of audio and/or video transfer, or even oral communications. 
              b. 
    "Confidential Information" shall include Trade Secrets and, more broadly, any information or material which is not generally known to the public, and which (i) is generated or collected by or utilized in the operations of the Company and relates to the actual or anticipated business of the Company or the Company's actual or prospective vendors or clients; or (ii) is suggested by or results from any task assigned to me by the Company or work performed by me for or on  
     
   11 

(OGRSU18) 

behalf of the Company or any client of the Company.  Confidential Information shall not be considered generally known to the public if revealed improperly to the public by me or others without the Company's express written consent and/or in violation of an obligation of confidentiality to the Company.   Confidential Information may take a variety of forms including but not limited to paper, electronic, media or transmission (such as email, file transfers, tape or web site features), and all other forms of audio and/or video transfer. Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to, customer, referral source, supplier and contractor identification and contacts, confidential information about customers, business relationships, contract terms, pricing and margins, business, marketing and customer plans and strategies, financial data, techniques, formulations, technical know-how, formulae, research, development and production information, processes, designs, architectures, prototypes, models, software,  patent applications and plans, projections, proposals, discussion guides, personal or performance information about employees, or legal advice related to the foregoing.  
  The restrictions set forth in this paragraph are in addition to and not in lieu of any obligations I have by law with respect to the Company's Confidential Information, including any obligations I may owe under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (the "TSA") and any applicable state statutes.  Further, nothing herein shall prohibit me from divulging evidence of criminal wrongdoing to law enforcement or prohibit me from disclosing Confidential Information or Trade Secrets if compelled by order of court or an agency of competent jurisdiction or as required by law; however, I shall promptly inform the Company of any such situations and shall take reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets until the Company has been informed of such required disclosure and has had a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order. Pursuant to the TSA, I understand that     an individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Additionally  ,   I understand that     an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to his or her attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, so long as any document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and the individual does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.   Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with the TSA or create liability for disclosures of Trade Secrets that are expressly allowed by TSA. 
  2.      Non-Competition  .      I agree that during my employment with the Company and for one year after the termination of my employment, I will not, directly or indirectly, invest in, own, operate, finance, control, or provide Competing Services to any Competing Business Line, in both cases as defined below.  I understand that the restrictions in this paragraph apply no matter whether my employment is terminated by me or the Company and no matter whether that termination is voluntary or involuntary.  The above restrictions shall not apply to passive investments of less than 5% ownership interest in any entity. I understand that the term "Competing Business Line" used in this Agreement means any business that is in competition with any business engaged in by the Company with respect to which I provide substantial services during the last two years of my employment with the Company. 
  
   12 

(OGRSU18) 

I understand that I will be deemed to be providing "Competing Services" if the nature of such services are sufficiently similar in position, scope and geographic area to any position held by me during the last two years of my employment with the Company. 
  3.      Non-Solicitation  .      I agree that during my employment with the Company and for two years after the termination of my employment from the Company for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary: 
           (a)  
    I will not directly or indirectly, solicit any Restricted Customer for purposes of providing Competing Products or Services, or offer, provide or sell Competing Products or Services to any Restricted Customer.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Competing Products or Services" means products or services that are competitive with products or services offered by, developed by, designed by or distributed by the Company to any Restricted Customer, and "Restricted Customer" means any person, company or entity which was a customer, potential customer, vendor, supplier or referral source of the Company and with which I had direct contact or about which I learned confidential information at any time during the last two years of my employment with the Company; and 
              (b) 
    I will not, nor will I assist any third party to, directly or indirectly (i) raid, hire, solicit, or attempt to persuade any employee of the Company with whom I currently work or with whom I worked at any point during the last two years preceding the termination of my employment with the Company,  and who possesses or had access to confidential information of the Company, to leave the employ of the Company; (ii) interfere with the performance by any such employee of his/her duties for the Company; or (iii) communicate with any such employee for the purposes described in items (i) and (ii) in this paragraph. 
     4.      Non-Inducement  .  I will not directly or indirectly assist or encourage any person or entity in carrying out or conducting any activity that would be prohibited by this Agreement if such activity were carried out or conducted by me. 
  5.      Non-Disparagement  .      I agree (whether or not I am then an Employee) not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company, its Affiliates, or any of their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, agents or products other than in the good faith performance of my duties to the Company and its Affiliates while I am employed by the Company and its Affiliates and thereafter.  The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements in response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings). 
  6.      Intellectual Property.    The term "Intellectual Property" shall mean all trade secrets, ideas, inventions, designs, developments, devices, software, computer programs, methods and processes (whether or not patented or patentable, reduced to practice or included in the Confidential Information) and all patents and patent applications related thereto, all copyrights, copyrightable works and mask works (whether or not included in the Confidential Information) and all registrations and  applications for registration related thereto, all Confidential Information, and all other proprietary rights contributed to, or conceived or created by, or reduced to practice by Employee  
  
   13 

(OGRSU18) 

or anyone acting on his/her behalf (whether alone or jointly with others) at any time from the beginning of Employee's employment with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. to the termination of that employment plus ninety (90) days, that (i) relate to the business or to the actual or anticipated research or development of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.; (ii) result from any services that Employee or anyone acting on its behalf perform for Walgreens; or (iii) are created using the equipment, supplies or facilities of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. or any Confidential Information.  
           a. 
    Ownership  .  All Intellectual Property is, shall be and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company.  Employee hereby assigns to the Company all right, title and interest, if any, in and to the Intellectual Property; provided, however, that, when applicable, the Company shall own the copyrights in all copyrightable works included in the Intellectual Property pursuant to the "work-made-for-hire" doctrine (rather than by assignment), as such term is defined in the 1976 Copyright Act.  All Intellectual Property shall be owned by the Company irrespective of any copyright notices or confidentiality legends to the contrary which may be placed on such works by Employee or by others.  Employee shall ensure that all copyright notices and confidentiality legends on all work product authored by Employee or anyone acting on his/her behalf shall conform to the Company's practices and shall specify the Company as the owner of the work.  The Company hereby provides notice to Employee that the obligation to assign does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Employee's own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) to the business of the Company, or (ii) to the Company's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work performed by Employee for the Company. 
              b. 
    Keep Records  .  Employee shall keep and maintain, or cause to be kept and maintained by anyone acting on his/her behalf, adequate and current written records of all Intellectual Property in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, computer files, reports or other documents relating thereto.  Such records shall be and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company and shall be available to the Company at all times during the term of this Agreement. 
              c. 
    Assistance  . Employee shall supply all assistance requested in securing for Company's benefit any patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, license, right or other evidence of ownership of any such Intellectual Property, and will provide full information regarding any such item and execute all appropriate documentation prepared by Company in applying or otherwise registering, in Company's name, all rights to any such item or the defense and protection of such Intellectual Property. 
              d. 
    Prior Inventions  .  Employee has disclosed to the Company any continuing obligations to any third party with respect to Intellectual Property.  Employee claims no rights to any inventions created prior to his/her employment for which a patent application has not previously been filed, unless he/she has described them in detail on a schedule attached to this Agreement. 
              e. 
    Trade Secret Provisions  .  The provisions in Paragraph 1 with regard to Trade Secrets and the TSA shall apply as well in the context of the parties' Intellectual Property rights and obligations.

7.      Return of Company Property  .  I agree that I will not take any of the Company's property or information with me when I leave the Company's employ, no matter what form that property or information is in and no matter how I acquired it.  When my employment with the Company terminates, I will immediately return to the Company any and all Company information, documents, and electronics.  
  8.      Consideration and Acknowledgments  .  I acknowledge and agree that the covenants described in this Agreement are essential terms, and the underlying Restricted Stock Unit Award would not be provided by the Company in the absence of these covenants.  I further acknowledge that these covenants are supported by adequate consideration as set forth in this Agreement and are not in conflict with any public interest.  I further acknowledge and agree that I fully understand these covenants, have had full and complete opportunity to discuss and resolve any ambiguities or uncertainties regarding these covenants before signing this Agreement, and have voluntarily agreed to comply with these covenants for their stated terms.

           (a) 
    I agree that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests and that full compliance with the terms of this Agreement will not prevent me from earning a livelihood following the termination of my employment, and that these covenants do not place undue restraint on me.   
              (b) 
    Because the Company's current base of operations is in Illinois and my connections thereto, (i) this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, where this Agreement is entered into, without giving effect to any conflict of law provisions, and (ii) I consent to personal jurisdiction and the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of Illinois with respect to any claim, dispute or declaration arising out of this Agreement. 
              (c) 
    In the event of a breach or a threatened breach of this Agreement, I acknowledge that the Company will face irreparable injury which may be difficult to calculate in dollar terms and that the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all remedies otherwise available in law or in equity, to temporary restraining orders and preliminary and final injunctions enjoining such breach or threatened breach in any court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of posting a surety bond, as well as to obtain an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of any violation of this Agreement. 
              (d) 
    I agree that if a court determines that any of the provisions in this Agreement is unenforceable or unreasonable in duration, territory, or scope, then that court shall modify those provisions so they are reasonable and enforceable, and enforce those provisions as modified.   
              (e) 
    If any phrase or provision of this Agreement is declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that phrase, clause or  
     
   15 

(OGRSU18) 

provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement, and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement, which shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.   
           (f) 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Agreement, the non-competition provisions of Paragraph 2 above shall not restrict Employee from performing legal services as a licensed attorney for a Competing Business to the extent that the attorney licensure requirements in the applicable jurisdiction do not permit Employee to agree to the otherwise applicable restrictions of Paragraph 2. 
              (g) 
    Waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement by the Company in any particular instance shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any provision in any other instance and/or of the Company's other rights at law or under this Agreement. 
              (h) 
    I agree that the Company may assign this Agreement to its successors and assigns and that any such successor or assign may stand in the Company's shoes for purposes of enforcing this Agreement. 
              (i)  
    I agree to reimburse the Company for all attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses that it reasonably incurs in connection with enforcing its rights and remedies under this Agreement, but only to the extent the Company is ultimately the prevailing party in the applicable legal proceedings. 
              (j) 
    If I violate this Agreement, then the restrictions set out in Paragraphs 2 - 6 shall be extended by the same period of time as the period of time during which the violation(s) occurred. 
              (k) 
    I fully understand my obligations in this Agreement, have had full and complete opportunity to discuss and resolve any ambiguities or uncertainties regarding these covenants before signing this Agreement, and have voluntarily agreed to comply with these covenants for their stated terms. 
     10.      Relationship of Parties  .  I acknowledge that my relationship with the Company is "terminable at will" by either party and that the Company or I can terminate the relationship with or without cause and without following any specific procedures.  Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall be relied upon to alter the "terminable at will" relationship between the parties.  I agree that my obligations in this Agreement shall survive the termination of my employment from the Company for any reason and shall be binding upon my successors, heirs, executors and representatives. 
  11.      Modifications and Other Agreements  .  I agree that the terms of this Agreement may not be modified except by a written agreement signed by both me and the Company.  This Agreement shall not supersede any other restrictive covenants to which I may be subject under an employment contract, benefit program or otherwise, such that the Company may enforce the terms of any and all restrictive covenants to which I am subject.  The obligations herein are in addition to and do not limit any obligations arising under applicable statutes and common law.

    Exclusion of Claim  .  You acknowledge and agree that you will have no entitlement to compensation or damages insofar as such entitlement arises or may arise from your ceasing to have rights under or to be entitled to the Restricted Stock Units, whether or not as a result of your Termination of Service (whether such termination is in breach of contract or otherwise), or from the loss or diminution in value of the Restricted Stock Units.  Upon the grant of Restricted Stock Units, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any such entitlement.

  RUSSIA 
    
  1.  No Offering of Securities in Russia  .  The grant of the Restricted Stock Units is not intended to be an offering of securities within the territory of the Russian Federation, and you acknowledge and agree that you will be unable to make any subsequent sale of the shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units in the Russian Federation. 
    
  2.  Repatriation Requirements  .

Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable for any fines or penalties resulting from your failure to comply with applicable laws.  
    
  SPAIN 
    
  1.  Acknowledgement of Discretionary Nature of the Plan; No Vested Rights  . This provision supplements the terms of the Agreement: 
    
  In accepting the Award, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan. 
    
  You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and in its sole discretion granted Restricted Stock Units under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company or its Affiliates throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any of its Affiliates on an ongoing basis.  Consequently, you understand that the Restricted Stock Units are granted on the  
  
   21 

(OGRSU18) 

assumption and condition that the Restricted Stock Units and the shares of Stock acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any of its Affiliates) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever.  In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and conditions referenced above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, the Award shall be null and void. 
    
  Further, you understand and agree that the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units is expressly conditioned on your continued and active rendering of service, such that upon a Termination of Service, the Restricted Stock Units may cease vesting immediately, in whole or in part, effective on the date of your Termination of Service (unless otherwise specifically provided in Section 4, 5 or 6 of the Agreement).  This will be the case, for example, even if (a) you are considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause; (b) you are dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (c) you terminate service due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition, (d) you terminate service due to a unilateral breach of contract by the Company or an Affiliate.

Dear Marco, 
    
  Contract of Employment 
    
  In reviewing our current practices in light of WBA s rules regarding statutory directorships, we have concluded that clause 15.3.2 (b) in your contract of employment dated 1 June 2005 is no longer a term we wish to rely upon and we therefore propose to remove it entirely. 
    
  The wording of the clause is as follows: 
    
  This Agreement shall automatically terminate (without notice or payment in lieu of notice): 
    
  if the Executive is, at the relevant time, a director of the Company or any Group Company and the Executive ceases to hold such office of director because: 
    
           (b) 
    he resigns such office of director;  

Please notify your agreement to the removal of the clause by signing and returning a copy of this letter to me at the address below by no later than Friday 3 August 2018.  
    
  At WBA, we constantly strive to protect our legitimate business interests and confidential information within all the markets and sectors in which we operate. For that reason, I would urge that you regularly familiarize yourself with the WBA Code of Conduct and Business Ethics and the terms of your employment contract which govern your obligations both during and after your employment with WBA. As you would expect, WBA reserves the right to take action to protect its interests and your adherence to your obligations whenever it is considered appropriate to do so. 
    
  Those obligations include your agreement not to work for competitors of WBA for a defined period after your employment comes to an end. Non-exhaustive examples of those competitors (as defined in your contract of employment) will be notified to you from time to time as our markets and competitors evolve but include, without limitation, our competitors within industries such as retail pharmacy, health   beauty retail, pharmaceutical wholesale, pharmacy benefit management and healthcare insurance, pre-wholesale, pharmaceutical logistics and the development of branded health   beauty products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. 

Should you wish to discuss the contents of this letter or what this change means in more detail, please don t hesitate to call me or your HR Business Partner and we will be happy to assist.  

Yours sincerely,
