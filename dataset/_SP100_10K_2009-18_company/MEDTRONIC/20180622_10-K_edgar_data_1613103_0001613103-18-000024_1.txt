All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, objectives of management for future operations and current expectations or forecasts of future results, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the  Risk Factors  section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.  One must carefully consider forward-looking statements and understand that such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, and involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed in the sections entitled  Government Regulation and Other Considerations  within  Item 1.

OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS 
    
  Research and Development 
  The chart below illustrates our research and development (R D) expense and R D expense as a percentage of net sales during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  : 
  
  The markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances. Constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products are necessary to maintain market leadership. Our R D efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve in order to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products, and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. That commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. Furthermore, our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. We have not engaged in significant customer or government-sponsored research. 
  Our R D activities include improving existing products and therapies, expanding their indications and applications for use, and developing new therapies and procedures. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation, improving our R D productivity, driving growth in emerging markets, clinical evidence generation, and assessing our R D programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to our customers.  
  Intellectual Property 
  We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole.  
  We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. For additional information, see Note   19   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sales and Distribution 
  We sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the U.S. and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the U.S. For certain portions of our business, we also sell through distributors in the U.S. Our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals, surgi-centers and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, GPOs and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) primarily through third-party distributors, although we also have direct sales representatives. We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our four largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, and China. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain under-penetrated. 
  Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide. To achieve this objective, we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products.  
  We are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.  
  Competition, Industry and Cost Containment 
  We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in     more than 150     countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products. In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies. 
  Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, and publications about our products, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products. 
  Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These changes put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms. Hospitals, which purchase implants, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, centralized purchasing, and in some cases, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products. 
  Worldwide Operations 
  Our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country. Exchange rate fluctuations may affect revenues, earnings, and cash flows from operations. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as derivative contracts, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flow. See  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  and Note   9   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8.

Production and Availability of Raw Materials 
  We manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, due to the U.S. FDA s manufacturing requirements, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources.  
  For additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to  Item 2. Properties  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Quality Management and Product Liability 
  Our business success depends on the quality of our products, and we have global processes, procedures and programs, including our  Quality Begins with Me  program, that are intended to help us maintain the highest possible level of quality in all products.     We operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class.  
  Working Capital  
  Our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to meet the product delivery needs of our customers. We also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers. 
  Employees 
  On   April 27, 2018  , we employed more than 86,000 full-time employees. Our employees are vital to our success. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment. 
  Seasonality 
  Worldwide sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality. However, the number of medical procedures incorporating Medtronic products is generally lower during summer months due to summer vacation schedules in the northern hemisphere, particularly in European countries.  
  Government Regulation 
  Our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European regulatory authorities such as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom (U.K.)  and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), and other government agencies inside and outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. Our business is also affected by patient privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations.  
  Product Approval and Monitoring 
  Many countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality of our products. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally obtained in one of two ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. This process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process.  
  In the E.U., a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017 which will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. The regulation has a three-year implementation  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

period to May 2020. After that time, medical devices marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directives before May 2020, can be placed on the market until May 2024. 
  The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products.  Regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing practices, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers  required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors"   We are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operation  s.  
  In April 2015, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. FDA relating to our Pain Therapies division's SynchroMed drug infusion system and the Neuromodulation quality system. The consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the SynchroMed pump and the Neuromodulation quality system. The consent decree s limitations on our ability to manufacture and distribute the SynchroMed drug infusion system were lifted by the U.S. FDA in September 2017. Following the successful completion of the required third-party expert audits, and in coordination with the FDA, the consent decree will be vacated. The Company must undergo third-party audits and submit audit reports to the U.S. FDA through 2020. 
  In June 2016, TYRX received a Warning Letter from the U.S. FDA following an inspection at the TYRX facility in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey. The U.S. FDA completed its follow up inspection to the Warning Letter in March 2018 and issued a 483 with observations, although the U.S. FDA noted in its closing meeting that there had been significant improvements made since the prior inspection. We continue to make progress on our commitments and continuously report the progress to the U.S. FDA. In June 2014, HeartWare Inc. received a Warning Letter from the U.S. FDA following an inspection at the HeartWare facility in Miami Lakes, Florida. We acquired HeartWare in August 2016, and have been implementing actions and process improvements to address the items in the Warning Letter. Upon completing implementation of actions and process improvements to address the items in the Warning Letters and reinspection by the U.S. FDA, we expect that the TYRX and HeartWare Warning Letters will be lifted.  
  Trade Regulations 
  The movement of products, services, and investment across borders subject us to extensive trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across borders. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import, export and other business activities. We are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. Some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability. Such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business. 
  Anti-Boycott Laws 
  Under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.

Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
  As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, new compliance challenges, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce. 
  For example, in the U.S., the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, international and industry levels. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH),  govern the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by  Covered Entities,  (which are health care providers that submit electronic claims, health plans, and health care clearinghouses) and by their  Business Associates  (which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a Covered Entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the Covered Entity s workforce). Rules under HIPAA and HITECH include specific security standards and breach notification requirements. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (through the Office of Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against Covered Entities and Business Associates with regard to both the Security and Privacy Rules, including civil and criminal liability. With the exception of certain of its operations in its Diabetes and care management services businesses, Medtronic is generally not a Covered Entity. Medtronic also operates as a Business Associate to Covered Entities in a limited number of instances. There are comparable state laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by health care providers, and Medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses. 
  In addition to the regulation of personal health information, a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, or that are designed to protect credit card account data. State consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. 
  Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. We serve customers in more than 150 countries. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the E.U., increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that will have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018. The new E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies uniformly across the E.U. and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the E.U. to comply with E.U. privacy and data protection rules. 
  Because the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. 
  Regulations Governing Reimbursement 
  The delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by HHS and comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care. Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services. 
  U.S. federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally-funded health care programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and health care fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers. In some circumstances, insurance companies can attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.  
  Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. Further, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the  ACA ), the U.S. is implementing value-based payment methodologies and seeking to create alternate payment models, such as bundled payments, to continue to drive improved value. 
  Environmental Health and Safety Laws 
  We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials.

Risks Relating to the Company 
  We operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively. 
  We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small, specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, technologies, or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.  
  We believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including: 

product performance and reliability, 
                
    product technology and innovation, 
                
    product quality and safety, 
                
    breadth of product lines, 
                
    product support services, 
                
    customer support, 
                
    cost-effectiveness and price, and 
                
    reimbursement approval from health care insurance providers. 
     Competition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies. From time to time we have lost, and may in the future lose, market share in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts and publications about our products, which highlights the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems to our business. In the current environment of managed care, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. Further, our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop, acquire and market new and differentiated products, technologies and intellectual property, and as a result we also face competition for marketing, distribution, and collaborative development agreements, establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create, invest in or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, and manufacture and successfully market our products. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success. 
  Reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales. 
  The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. We manufacture the majority of our products at numerous manufacturing facilities worldwide. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, certain components and raw materials used in our products are obtained from a sole supplier. Although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, the supply of these components and raw materials may be interrupted or insufficient. In addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies, including the U.S. FDA, regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources. Furthermore, the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products, which are often volatile and outside of our control, could adversely impact our supply. We use resins, other petroleum-based materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products, and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner and could result in lost sales. 
  Other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes or wildfires, and other environmental factors, could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. For example, in June 2017 we experienced a global information technology systems  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

interruption that affected our customer ordering, distribution, and manufacturing processes. Furthermore, any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues. 
  In addition, several of our key products are manufactured at a particular manufacturing facility, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of such facilities, such as the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in September 2017, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at the previous levels or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost.  
  We are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. 
  Our medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the U.S. FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services-Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or the market s or U.S. FDA s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may: 
             
    take a significant amount of time, 
                
    require the expenditure of substantial resources, 
                
    involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance, 
                
    involve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products, and 
                
    limit the proposed uses of our products. 
     Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under U.S. FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA to determine compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on U.S. FDA s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such medical products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of non-U.S governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Furthermore, we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies, and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices, we cannot predict the timing, outcome or impact of any such investigations. Any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs and/or entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional, costly compliance obligations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
  In addition, the U.S. FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.  
  Governmental regulations outside the U.S. have, and may continue to, become increasingly stringent and common. In the European Union, for example, a new Medical Device Regulation was published in 2017 which, when it enters into full force in 2020, will  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company s business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. Future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us. 
  Our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Our devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and health care fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers. In certain circumstances, insurance companies can attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.  
  We are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies, and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the U.S. and around the world. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems, could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. 
  We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others. 
  We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
  While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents, trade secrets or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and these licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge. 
  In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in those countries. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

Quality problems and product liability claims could lead to recalls or safety alerts, reputational harm, adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure, and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. Component failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions, which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Due to the strong name recognition of the Medtronic and Covidien brands, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future. 
  Strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fail to meet these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precision-engineered components, subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation, competitive advantage and market share could be harmed. In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data. 
  Any of the foregoing problems, including future product liability claims or recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful. 
  Our mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller, healthier lives, which requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts, historically we have relied, and expect to continue to rely, upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas. 
  We expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses. Investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Health care policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us. 
  In response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the health care system, including U.S. health care reform legislation. Certain of these proposals could, among other things, limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses. 
  We have elected to self-insure most of our insurable risks across the Company, and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace. We manage and maintain a portion of our self-insured program through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. We continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with a third-party insurer that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the Company. We continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future. Although we believe, based on historical loss trends, that our self-insurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses, historical trends may not be indicative of future losses. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

If we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  We have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other third-party payers on our customers, increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers. If the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected. 
  We are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results. 
  We develop, manufacture, distribute and sell our products globally. Operations in countries outside of the U.S. are accompanied by certain risks. We intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional and greater risks. Our profitability and global operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: 
             
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates, 
                
    healthcare reform legislation, 
                
    the need to comply with different regulatory regimes worldwide that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products, 
                
    local product preferences and product requirements, 
                
    longer-term receivables than are typical in the U.S., 
                
    trade protection measures, tariffs and other border taxes, and import or export licensing requirements, 
                
    less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the U.S. than exists in the U.S., 
                
    different labor regulations and workforce instability, 
                
    political and economic instability, 
                
    the expiration and non-renewal of foreign tax rulings and/or grants, 
                
    potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, and 
                
    economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations. 
     On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as  Brexit .  As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. Similarly, from time to time proposals are made in the U.S. to significantly change existing trade agreements and relationships between the U.S. and other countries, although we cannot currently predict whether or how these changes will be implemented. Changes to trade policy may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  In addition, a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries. In light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Finally, changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues, expenses, and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes. 
  The failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions. 
  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-administered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. We also participate in public-private partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe. 
  Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors. It is our policy  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  

to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and prohibit improper practices. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business. 
  The U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations. 
  From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba and the region of Crimea. Certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices, and may provide related services, to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. 
  Many health care industry companies, including health care systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
  Health care industry cost-containment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components. 
  Most of our customers, and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. If third-party payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients, sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components. The cost-containment measures that health care providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals, and GPOs and IDNs have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies, including us.   
  We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation. 
  We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents in medical products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for medical devices. Our operations involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we violate these environmental laws and regulations, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens. 
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. 
  The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
  The continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals. 
  If we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals, many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability. The research, development, marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants, inventors and public speakers. If we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We rely on the proper function, security and availability of our information technology systems and data to operate our business, and a breach, cyber-attack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position  .    
  We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business, including to process, transmit and store sensitive data, and many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to our systems. Like other large multi-national corporations, we could experience, and in the past have experienced, attempted or actual interference with the integrity of, and interruptions in, our technology systems, as well as data breaches, such as cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference with the integrity of our products and data or other significant disruptions. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems. These third-party systems could also become vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference or other significant disruptions, and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. In addition, we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and, as a result, may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems, or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems. 
  Our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. The variety of U.S. and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in  Item 1. Business" -   Other Factors Impacting Our Operations - Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations  . For example, in the E.U. the Data Protection Directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the E.U., and the new General Data Protection Regulation may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of violations occurring after its implementation in May 2018. Furthermore, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyber-attacks. Any data security breaches, cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies and/or civil litigation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position.  
  In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating, protecting, upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities, continuing to build security into the design of our products, and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future.

If our information technology systems, products or services or sensitive data are compromised, patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality, and we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws, state laws, or the laws of other jurisdictions, experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, product failure, information technology outages or disruptions, or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation.  
  Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business. 
  At April 27, 2018, we had approximately   $2.1 billion   of current debt obligations and   $23.7 billion   of long-term debt outstanding. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including: 
             
    making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, 
                
    increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged, 
                
    limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, 
                
    limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, and 
                
    exposing us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under our floating rate notes and revolving credit facility is variable. 
     Our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business, acquisitions, and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. If our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt, which could harm our long-term business prospects. Our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.  
  Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business. 
  As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies, we have made several significant acquisitions in recent years, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so. Factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include: 
             
    the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies, 
                
    our ability or inability to integrate information technology systems of acquired companies in a secure and reliable manner, 
                
    adverse developments arising out of investigations by governmental entities of the business practices of acquired companies, including potential FCPA liability, 
                
    any decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies  product lines and sales and marketing practices, including price increases, 
                
    our ability to retain key employees, and 
                
    the ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies, such as increasing sales of the integrated company s products, achieving cost savings, and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. 
     We also could experience negative effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.

Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  We are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in the U.S., Ireland, and various other jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax laws in the U.S., Ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted   comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act")  , which resulted in a significant charge to tax expense during our quarter ending January 2018 associated with the U.S. taxation of accumulated foreign earnings as well as the requirement to revalue U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. 
  Certain elements of the   Tax Act   impact fiscal year 2018 while other portions of the legislation are not effective until future fiscal years. The U.S. Treasury has issued additional guidance subsequent to the enactment of the   Tax Act,   and we expect ongoing guidance to be provided which could change the impact on our tax reserves. We made reasonable estimates of the effect of the   Tax Act   and recorded provisional amounts in the financial statements for fiscal year 2018. Additional guidance, as well as future changes to these rules, may result in adjustments to these estimates which could materially affect our financial results. 
  In 2013, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published an action plan called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) with a view to tackling perceived tax abuse and inconsistency between taxing authorities and their approach to International tax matters. The final BEPS Action report was published in October 2015 and subsequently many taxing authorities have adopted the guidelines provided within their local laws. The EU expanded upon these guidelines with Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (ATAD) to be applied by its member states. We continue to monitor any and all changes to local country legislation resulting from this guidance. One specific change is a requirement for increased disclosures of financial information on a local and global basis. This information could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions.  
  We are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  
  We have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable, we would incur additional charges, and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  The Medtronic, Inc. tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. 
  In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report for Medtronic Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreements with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of our key manufacturing sites. An adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  See Note   19   to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  Future potential changes to the U.S. tax laws could result in us being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and the IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S federal income tax purposes. 
  Because Medtronic plc is organized under the laws of Ireland, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even so, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). 
  Under Section 7874 of the Code, if Medtronic Inc. s shareholders immediately prior to the Covidien transaction held 80% or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in Medtronic, Inc. immediately after the transaction (the ownership  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

test), and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction did not have substantial business activities in Ireland relative to its worldwide activities (the substantial business activities test), we would have been treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Based on the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code, Medtronic, Inc. s shareholders received approximately 70% of our ordinary shares (by both vote and value) by reason of holding stock in Medtronic, Inc. Therefore, under current law, we should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, there is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874, including the application of the ownership test. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation. 
  Legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business. 
  Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business. 
  Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation 
  We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. 
  Our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland. 
  As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the U.S. 
  As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval, which may limit Medtronic s flexibility to manage its capital structure. 
  Under Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution. Such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares. Accordingly, our articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, provisions authorizing the board to issue new shares, and to disapply statutory preemption rights. The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities. 
  A transfer of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty. 
  Transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (DTC) will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

value of the shares acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares. 
  In certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax. 
  In certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and other specified countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax. 
  Shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax, provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us). However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of their shares. 
  Shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in our Company (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who receive dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends. 
  Our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax. 
  Irish capital acquisitions tax (CAT) could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold which Irish Revenue typically updates annually in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents.

  Item 5. Market for Medtronic s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The Company s ordinary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  MDT.  
  The following table provides information about the shares repurchased by the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018:     

  In June 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized, subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves, the repurchase of 80 million of the Company s ordinary shares. As authorized by the Board of Directors, the Company's share repurchase program expires when the total number of authorized shares have been repurchased. This repurchase authorization was replaced in June 2017 with the repurchase authorization described below. As such, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the June 2015 share repurchase program is no longer applicable to the repurchase program in place.  
  In June 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $5.0 billion of the Company s ordinary shares. This authorization replaces the June 2015 authorization described above. There is no specific time-period associated with this repurchase authorization. 
  On June 20, 2018, there were approximately 29,965 shareholders of record of the Company s ordinary shares. Ordinary cash dividends declared and paid totaled 46.0 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year   2018   and 43.0 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year   2017  . The following prices are the high and low market sales quotations per share of the Company s ordinary shares for the fiscal years and quarters indicated:

  Irish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital  
  Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies. Except as indicated below, dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities. The Financial Transfers Act, 1992, provides that the Irish Minister for Finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. For the purposes of this Act,  financial transfers  include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the EU if they had been made between Member States of the EU. This Act has been used by the Minister for Finance to implement European Council Directives, which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries, organizations and people including the Al-Qaeda network and the Taliban, Afghanistan, Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), Democratic People s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Republic of Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine.

Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law. 
  Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders  
  Dividends paid by Medtronic will generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 percent) unless an exemption applies. 
  Dividends paid to U.S. residents will not be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax provided that: 

in the case of a beneficial owner of Medtronic shares held in the Depository Trust Company (DTC), the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the United States and this information is provided by the broker to the Company s qualifying intermediary; or 

in the case of a record owner, the record owner has provided to the Company s transfer agent a valid U.S Certification of Residence (Form 6166) or valid Irish Non-Resident Form V2. 
     Irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on Medtronic s ordinary shares. A U.S. resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold Medtronic shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any Irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by Medtronic. In addition, if a U.S. shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax, the withholding payment discharges any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder furnishes to the Irish Revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed. 
  While the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data 
  Our fiscal year-end is the last Friday in April, and therefore, the total weeks in a fiscal year fluctuates between 52 and 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2018, 2017, 2015, and 2014 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year, with the additional week occurring in the first quarter. The table below illustrates operating results and other selected financial data for fiscal years 2014 to 2018:

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. You should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017   and for each of the three fiscal years ended   April 27, 2018   (fiscal year 2018),   April 28, 2017   (fiscal year 2017), and   April 29, 2016   (fiscal year   2016  ), which are presented within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year-end is the last Friday in April, and therefore, the total weeks in a fiscal year fluctuates between 52 and 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year, with the additional week occurring in the first quarter.  
  Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that we use to evaluate the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" and are intended to supplement, and should not be considered as superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We generally use non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry. 
    
  As presented in the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations section below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends, and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments).  
    
  In the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported. Because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the income tax provision, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments. 
    
  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting property, plant, and equipment additions from operating cash flows. 
    
  Refer to the  GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations," "Income Taxes," and "Free Cash Flow" sections for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
   
  EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW 
  Medtronic is among the world's largest medical technology, services, and solutions companies - alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. Our primary products include those for cardiac rhythm disorders, cardiovascular disease, advanced and general surgical care, respiratory and monitoring solutions, renal care, neurological disorders, spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma, urological and digestive disorders, and ear, nose, and throat and diabetes conditions. 
  The table below presents net income attributable to Medtronic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  : 

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year   2018   as compared to fiscal year   2017   was unfavorably affected by the net $2.4 billion tax charge related to the enactment of U.S. comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which had a significant effect on the income tax provision in fiscal year   2018  . Further, diluted EPS for fiscal year   2018   was unfavorably affected by an investment loss related to the impairment of certain cost and equity method investments of    $227 million  , along with impairments of IPR D of   $68 million  . Additionally, for fiscal year   2018  , diluted EPS was unfavorably affected by the July 29, 2017 sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. Net sales of these businesses for fiscal years   2018   and   2017   were $0.6 billion and $2.4  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

billion, respectively. For fiscal year   2018  , diluted EPS was partially offset by a   $697 million   gain on the sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses. 
  Diluted EPS for fiscal year 2017 as compared to 2016 was favorably affected by the recognition of certain tax adjustments of $417 million, including a charge of $442 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily related to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from our completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy Covidien businesses that reduced the cash and investments held by our U.S. controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries, partially offset by a benefit related to the establishment of a deferred tax asset on the tax basis in excess of book basis of a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of which we disposed. Further, diluted EPS was also affected by a $226 million charge in fiscal year 2016 related to the recognition of the fair value step-up of acquired Covidien inventory.  
  GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations   The tables below present reconciliations of our Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  :

NET SALES 
  Segment and Division  
  The table below illustrates net sales by segment and division for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  : 

(1) 
    During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Surgical Solutions and Patient Monitoring   Recovery divisions of the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group were realigned into the Surgical Innovations and Respiratory, Gastrointestinal,   Renal divisions. Refer to the "Minimally Invasive Therapies Group" discussion within this Management's Discussion and Analysis for more information on the composition of the Surgical Innovations and Respiratory, Gastrointestinal,   Renal divisions.  
     For fiscal year   2018  , total net sales were unfavorably affected by the divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group which closed on the first day of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. Our performance continues to be fueled by our three growth strategies: therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value. We are creating competitive advantages and capitalizing on the long-term trends in healthcare: namely the desire to improve clinical outcomes, the growing demand for expanded access to care, and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems. In our therapy innovation growth strategy, we continue to see clear acceleration in our innovation cycle, with several meaningful new product launches during fiscal year 2018 across all of our segments. We advanced a pipeline of groundbreaking medical technology, and we are creating new markets, disrupting existing markets, and leading in several of the fastest growth markets. In globalization, net sales in emerging markets grew   12%   during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. Our consistent emerging market performance continues to benefit from geographic diversification, with strong, balanced results around the world. In our third growth strategy, economic value, we continue to execute our value-based healthcare signature programs and aggressively develop unique, value-based healthcare solutions that directly link our therapies to improving outcomes across each of our segments. We remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume.

Cardiac and Vascular Group's net sales for fiscal year   2018  , as compared to fiscal year 2017, benefited from strong net sales in all three divisions. See the more detailed discussion of each division's performance below. 
  Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure net sales for fiscal year   2018   were   $5.9 billion  , an increase of   5   percent as compared to fiscal year 2017. Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure net sales growth for fiscal year   2018   was driven by strong growth in Arrhythmia Management and Heart Failure. The strong growth in Arrhythmia Management was largely due to growth in AF Solutions, driven by the continued global acceptance of our Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter (Arctic Front) system, growth in Diagnostics, driven by the continued adoption of the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor, as well as strong adoption of the Micra transcatheter pacing system and TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. The strong growth in Heart Failure was driven by growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support from sales of the HVAD system, as well as continued demand for the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system, which launched in the U.S. in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  
  Coronary   Structural Heart net sales for fiscal year   2018   were   $3.6 billion  , an increase of   14   percent as compared to fiscal year 2017. Coronary   Structural Heart net sales growth for fiscal year   2018   was largely driven by the continued strong customer adoption of the Evolut PRO Transcatheter Aortic Valve system (Evolut PRO) and the Evolut R 34mm transcatheter aortic heart valve, as well as continued penetration into intermediate risk in the U.S., which received approval late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Net sales growth was also driven by the continued strong demand for the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the U.S. and Japan, which launched in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.   
  Aortic   Peripheral Vascular net sales for fiscal year   2018   were   $1.8 billion  , an increase of   6   percent as compared to fiscal year 2017. Aortic   Peripheral Vascular net sales growth for fiscal year 2018 was driven by growth in Valiant Captivia Thoracic stent grafts, Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) balloons and drug-coated balloons, as well as success of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System.  Net sales growth was further driven by strong performance in EndoVenous due to accelerated growth of the VenaSeal vein closure system, for which approval for reimbursement payment in the U.S. from the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services (CMS) was initiated in January 2018.  
  The Cardiac and Vascular Group's net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $10.5 billion  , an increase of   3   percent as compared to fiscal year 2016. The Cardiac and Vascular Group s net sales for fiscal year 2017 were unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter fiscal year 2016. The Cardiac and Vascular Group's net sales for fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016, benefited from strong net sales in Arrhythmia Management within Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure, largely due to growth in AF Solutions and Diagnostics, Coronary   Structural Heart, largely due to the transcatheter aortic heart valve in the U.S. and Europe, and in Aortic   Peripheral Vascular, as well as the acquisition of HeartWare in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. See the more detailed discussion of each division's performance below. 
  Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure net sales for fiscal year 2017 were   $5.6 billion  , an increase of   3 percent   as compared to fiscal year 2016. Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure net sales growth for fiscal year 2017 was driven by strong growth in Arrhythmia Management, largely due to growth in AF Solutions and Diagnostics. The strong growth in AF Solutions was driven by the continued global acceptance of our Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter (Arctic Front) system, including strong growth in Japan. The strong growth in Diagnostics was driven by the continued adoption of the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac

monitor. Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure also benefited from the acquisition of HeartWare, which was acquired during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
  Coronary   Structural Heart net sales for fiscal year 2017 were   $3.1 billion  , an increase of   1 percent   as compared to fiscal year 2016. Coronary   Structural Heart net sales growth for fiscal year 2017 was largely driven by the continued launch of the Evolut R 34mm transcatheter aortic heart valve in the U.S. and Europe. Net sales growth was partially offset by challenges with drug-eluting stents in both the U.S. and Japan due to competitive pressures related to the anticipated approval of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stents in these countries, which received U.S. FDA approval, as well as approval in Japan, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Net sales growth was also partially offset by continued pricing pressures and competition worldwide in our Coronary business. 
  Aortic   Peripheral Vascular net sales for fiscal year 2017 were   $1.7 billion  , an increase of   6 percent   as compared to fiscal year 2016. Aortic   Peripheral Vascular net sales growth for fiscal year 2017 was driven by the continued strong worldwide growth of the IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon as well as success of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System and the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft. Net sales growth as compared to fiscal year 2016 was also driven by the launch of the HawkOne 6 French directional atherectomy system in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
  Looking ahead, we expect our Cardiac and Vascular Group could be affected by the following: 
             
    Continued acceptance and growth of the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system, which received CE Mark approval in February 2017 and launched in Europe during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.

  Specialty Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2018   were   $1.6 billion  , an increase of   4   percent as compared to fiscal year   2017  .     Specialty Therapies net sales growth was driven by growth in ENT, Pelvic Health, and Transformative Solutions. 
  Pain Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2018   were   $1.2 billion  , an increase of   3   percent as compared to fiscal year   2017  . Pain Therapies net sales growth was driven by Interventional from the OsteoCool RF Spinal Tumor ablation system. Within Spinal Cord Stimulation, the Intellis Platform launch and ongoing roll-out of the Evolve workflow algorithm contributed to net sales in fiscal year   2018   and helped mitigate competitive pressures in the U.S. and Europe. 
  Spine net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $2.6 billion  , flat as compared to fiscal year   2016  . Spine net sales were driven by growth in BMP due to strong U.S. sales, offset by declines in Europe due to the InductOs stop shipment due to suspension in the E.U. Core Spine had net sales growth in the U.S due to new product launches including the Solera Voyager and Elevate expandable cage in conjunction with the "Speed to Scale" initiative, offset by market softness in Europe and the Middle East driven by the macro-economic conditions. Inductos returned to the European market in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

Brain Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $2.1 billion  , an increase of   6 percent   as compared to fiscal year   2016  . The increase in net sales was driven by strong growth in both Neurovascular and Neurosurgery. Neurovascular net sales growth was driven by growth in coils from the Axium Prime Extra Soft detachable coil, growth in flow diversion from the Pipeline Flex embolization device, and growth in stents due to the Solitaire revascularization device, partially offset by declines due to a voluntary recall of certain product lines in the second quarter. Neurosurgery net sales growth was driven by strong sales of navigation capital equipment, disposables, and the O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. Despite competitive pressure, Brain Modulation drove net sales growth with U.S. sales of the MR Conditional Activa DBS portfolio and through updated Parkinson s Disease labeling for patients with Recent Onset of Motor Complications. 
  Specialty Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $1.5 billion  , an increase of   5 percent   as compared to fiscal year   2016  . The increase in net sales was driven by strong growth in Transformative Solutions and Pelvic Health and growth in ENT. Net sales growth in Transformative Solutions was driven by the sales of the Aquamantys Transcollation and PEAK PlasmaBlade products. Net sales growth in Pelvic Health was driven by strong InterStim implant growth in the U.S. Net sales growth in ENT benefited from strong adoption of new products, including NuVent balloons and Fusion Compact navigation.  
  Pain Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $1.1 billion  , a decrease of   4 percent   as compared to fiscal year   2016  . The decrease in net sales was driven by declines in sales of spinal cord stimulation products due to competitive pressures in the U.S., partially offset by growth in Interventional from the OsteoCool RF Spinal Tumor ablation system.  
  Looking ahead, we expect our Restorative Therapies Group could be affected by the following:  
             
    Continued acceptance and growth of the Solitare FR revascularization device for treatment of acute ischemic stroke and the Pipeline Embolization Devices, endovascular treatments for large or giant wide-necked brain aneurysms.

Diabetes Group      
  The Diabetes Group's products include insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, insulin pump consumables, and therapy management software. The Diabetes Group s net sales for fiscal year   2018   were   $2.1 billion  , an increase of   11   percent as compared to fiscal year 2017. The Diabetes Group's net sales increased for fiscal year   2018  , primarily as a result of an increase in sales in the U.S. due to continued growth in our customer base through the continued adoption of the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. Further, we experienced continued growth in international markets due to strong sales of the MiniMed 640G system in Europe and Asia Pacific.  
  The Diabetes Group s net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $1.9 billion  , an increase of   3   percent as compared to fiscal year   2016  . The Diabetes Group's net sales for fiscal year   2017   benefited from growth in both the U.S. and international markets due to strong U.S. sales of the MiniMed 630G system and interest in the Priority Access Program for the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system, as well as strong international sales in Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific of the MiniMed 640G system with the Enhanced Enlite sensor.  
  Looking ahead, we expect our Diabetes Group could be affected by the following: 
             
    Continued increases in sensor manufacturing capacity to benefit from rapidly growing demands. In the fourth quarter of 2018, sensor expansion efforts were met with unconstrained capacity and completed with no back orders. We expect to keep sensor utilization strong and continue commercial expansion into the new fiscal year.  
                
    Continued acceptance and growth of the MiniMed 670G system, the first hybrid closed loop system in the world. The system features our most advanced SmartGuard algorithm, which enables improved glucose control with reduced user input. The MiniMed 670G system received U.S. FDA approval during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and launched in the U.S. in June 2017.  
                
    Changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs, along with payor coverage of the MiniMed 670G system.  
                
    Continued acceptance and growth of the MiniMed 640G system with SmartGuard Suspend before Low technology, which has launched in Europe, Australia, and select countries in Latin America and Asia, and the MiniMed 620G system, the first integrated system customized for the Japanese market. The MiniMed 640G system received regulatory approval in Japan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.  
                
    Continued acceptance and growth of Guardian Connect CGM system which displays information directly to a smartphone. This system received CE mark in 2016 and has launched both internationally and now in the U.S. after receiving FDA approval in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.  
                
    Continued partnership with UnitedHealthcare as the preferred in-network provider of insulin pumps, giving their members access to our advanced diabetes technology and comprehensive support services. 
                
    Continued partnership and growth of our outcomes-based agreement with Aetna, where a component of our pump reimbursement is based on successfully meeting clinical improvement thresholds as part of our value-based healthcare solutions.  
      
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  We have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
  Our critical accounting estimates include the following: 
  Litigation Contingencies     We are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, income tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations. The outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions. Estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. Our significant legal proceedings are discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Income Tax Reserves and U.S. Tax Reform     We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is (i) a completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue, (iii) a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iv) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows. 
  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which significantly revises U.S. corporate income taxation by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate, broadening the base of taxation, and implementing a territorial tax system. We have a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recognition of the related tax impacts. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from the provisional amounts recognized in the current period, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in our interpretation of the Tax Act, legislative or administrative actions to clarify the intent of the statutory language provided that differ from our current interpretation, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the impacts, including changes to current year earnings estimates and applicable foreign exchange rates. 
  Valuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill     When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price consideration over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets primarily include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and IPR D. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks. 
  The test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates to determine fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value, including projected future cash flows. We assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. 
  We test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired. Our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, appropriate discount rates, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. We use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant's view of the assets being evaluated. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including, among others, changes in competitive conditions, timing of regulatory approval, results of clinical trials, changes in worldwide economic conditions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  
  We assess the impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Our impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangibles require us to make several estimates to determine fair value, including projected future cash flows and discount rates.

  COSTS AND EXPENSES 
  The following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales: 

Cost of Products Sold     We continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management, manufacturing improvements, and optimizing our manufacturing network.  
  Cost of products sold was   $9.1 billion  ,   $9.3 billion  , and   $9.1 billion   during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. The decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of sales from fiscal year 2018 as compared to 2017 was due primarily to the divestiture of lower-margin products in conjunction with the divestiture of our Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses during fiscal year 2018 and a $38 million charge during fiscal year   2017   related to the recognition of the fair value step-up taken on inventory acquired in connection with the HeartWare acquisition. The decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of sales due to the divestiture and fair-value step-up on HeartWare inventory was partially offset by $17 million of costs recognized in relation to restoring operations at four Puerto Rico manufacturing sites after Hurricane Maria, including idle facility costs, asset write-downs, and other facility-related costs, and the infusion set recall in our Diabetes Group. The decrease in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was largely due to a $226 million charge in fiscal year 2016 related to the recognition of the fair value step-up of acquired Covidien inventory. 
  Research and Development Expense     We remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence. We are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare. 
  Research and development expense was   $2.3 billion  ,   $2.2 billion  , and   $2.2 billion   during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. Research and development expense remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales with a slight decrease from fiscal year   2016   to   2018   due, in part, to the timing of clinical trials and product approvals, as well as our sales increasing at a slower rate than the increase in research and development following the divestiture of our Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses.  
  Selling, General, and Administrative Expense     Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives and to continue to realize cost synergies expected from our acquisitions. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consist of salaries and wages, as well as other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses.  
  Selling, general, and administrative expense was   $10.0 billion  ,   $9.7 billion  , and   $9.5 billion   during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased a percentage of net sales from fiscal year   2017   to   2018  , as we incurred expenses associated with new product launches and Transition Service Agreements (TSAs). In conjunction with the divestiture of our Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses on July 29, 2017, we entered into TSAs with Cardinal to ensure and facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations. Expenses associated with the TSA agreements are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses; however, TSA revenue is recognized in   other expense, net  , thereby contributing to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue.  
  Selling, general, and administrative expense remained fairly flat as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, with a slight decrease due to cost savings associated with selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives.

The following is a summary of other costs and expenses: 

Amortization of Intangible Assets     Amortization of intangible assets     includes the amortization expense of our definite-lived intangible assets, consisting of purchased patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and other intangible assets. Amortization expense was   $1.8 billion  ,   $2.0 billion  , and   $1.9 billion   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. The decrease in amortization expense from fiscal year   2017   to fiscal year   2018   is primarily attributable to the discontinuation of amortization on the definite-lived intangible assets classified as assets held for sale at April 28, 2017 and through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 related to the divestiture of our Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses. This divestiture was completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.  
   
  Restructuring 
  Enterprise Excellence 
  In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we announced a multi-year global Enterprise Excellence Program designed to drive long-term business growth and sustainable efficiency. The Enterprise Excellence Program is expected to further leverage our global size and scale as well as enhance the customer and employee experience. 
  The Enterprise Excellence Program is focused on three objectives: 
             
    Global Operations - integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes, systems and site presence to improve quality, delivery cost and cash flow 
                
    Functional Optimization - enhancing and leveraging global operating models and systems across several enabling functions to improve productivity and employee experience 
                
    Commercial Optimization - optimizing certain processes, systems and models to improve productivity and the customer experience 
       
  The Enterprise Excellence Program is designed to drive operating margin improvement, as well as fund investment in strategic growth initiatives, with expected annual gross savings of more than   $3.0 billion   from cost reductions and leverage of our fixed infrastructure by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately   $500 million   to   $700 million   of gross annual savings are expected to be achieved each fiscal year through the end of fiscal year 2022. 
    
  The Enterprise Excellence Program is expected to result in pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately   $1.6 billion   to   $1.8 billion  , the vast majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022 and result in cash outlays to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023. Approximately half of the estimated restructuring charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining restructuring charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses. We expect these costs to be recognized within   restructuring charges, net, cost of products sold,   and   selling, general and administrative expense   in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  During fiscal year   2018  , we recognized restructuring charges of   $96 million  . For fiscal year   2018  , restructuring charges included   $35 million   of employee termination benefits recognized within   restructuring charges, net   in the consolidated statements of income. For fiscal year   2018  , restructuring charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including   $28 million   recognized within   cost of products sold   and   $33 million   recognized within   selling, general and administrative expense   in the consolidated statements of income.

Cost Synergies 
    
  In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we achieved   $850 million   in cost synergies related to the acquisition of Covidien. The cost synergies related to administrative office optimization, manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, and certain general and administrative savings. Cash outlays for the cost synergies program are scheduled to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2019. 
    
  During fiscal year   2018  , we recognized restructuring charges of   $45 million  , partially offset by accrual adjustments of   $34 million  . Accrual adjustments relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within Medtronic, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination benefits being less than initially estimated. For fiscal year   2018  , restructuring charges included   $29 million   of employee termination benefits and contract termination costs recognized within   restructuring charges, net   in the consolidated statements of income. Restructuring charges also included other costs of   $12 million   recognized within   cost of products sold   and   $4 million   recognized within   selling, general and administrative expense. 
    
  For fiscal years     2017     and 2016, we recognized restructuring charges of     $441 million     and     $332 million  , respectively, partially offset by accrual adjustments of     $68 million     and     $18 million  , respectively. Accrual adjustments relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within Medtronic, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination benefits being less than initially estimated. For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, restructuring charges included asset write-downs of     $17 million     and     $14 million  , respectively, related to property, plant, and equipment impairments, and     $10 million     and     $9 million  ,     respectively, related to inventory write-offs recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, fiscal year 2017 restructuring charges included   $73 million   of incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages.  
    
  For additional information, see Note   4   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Acquisition-Related Items     Acquisition-related items includes expenses incurred in connection with the integration of Covidien, our $50.0 billion acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, transaction expenses incurred in connection with business combinations, and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. During fiscal year   2018  , we recognized acquisition-related items expense of   $132 million  , including   $28 million   recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. During fiscal year   2018  , acquisition-related items expense includes   $172 million   of costs associated with the integration of Covidien manufacturing, distribution, and administrative facilities as well as information technology system implementation and benefits harmonization, partially offset by the change in fair value of contingent consideration as a result of revised revenue forecasts and the timing of anticipated regulatory milestones. 
  During fiscal year   2017  , we recognized acquisition-related items expense of $230 million, including $10 million recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. During fiscal year   2017  , acquisition-related items expense primarily includes $225 million of costs associated with the integration of Covidien manufacturing, distribution, and administrative facilities as well as information technology system implementation and benefits harmonization, $23 million of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense, and expenses incurred in connection with the HeartWare acquisition and planned divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein, Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses, partially offset by the change in fair value of contingent consideration as a result of revised revenue forecasts and the timing of anticipated regulatory milestones. 
  During fiscal year 2016, we recognized acquisition-related items expense of $283 million, including $219 million of costs associated with the integration of Covidien manufacturing, distribution, and administrative facilities as well as information technology system implementation and benefits harmonization and $58 million of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense.  
  Certain Litigation Charges     We classify litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges. During fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , we recognized   $61 million  ,   $300 million  , and   $26 million  , respectively, of certain litigation charges related to probable and estimable damages for significant legal matters. 
  Divestiture-Related Items    Divestiture-related items include expenses incurred in connection with the divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses. During fiscal year   2018  , we recognized divestiture-related items expense of   $114 million  , primarily comprised of expenses incurred for professional services, including banker, legal, tax, and advisory fees, and $16 million of accelerated stock compensation expense related to the acceleration of the vesting period for employees that transferred with the divestiture. There was no divestiture-related items expense for fiscal years   2017   and   2016  . 
  Gain on Sale of Businesses    We recognized a pre-tax gain of   $697 million   on the sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses during fiscal year   2018  . No businesses were sold during fiscal years   2017   or   2016  .

Special Charge       Continuing our commitment to improve the health of people and communities throughout the world, we recognized a charge of   $80 million   in fiscal year   2018   and $  100 million   in fiscal year   2017   for charitable contributions to the Medtronic Foundation. 
   
  Other Expense, Net     Other expense, net includes royalty income and expense, realized equity security gains and losses, TSA income, intangible asset impairments, currency transaction and derivative gains and losses, and Puerto Rico excise tax. In fiscal year   2018  , other expense, net was $  505 million   as compared to $  222 million   in fiscal year   2017  . The increase from fiscal year   2017   to fiscal year   2018   was primarily attributable to remeasurement and our hedging programs, which resulted in a $176 million loss for fiscal year 2018 as compared to an $81 million gain in fiscal year 2017, losses of   $68 million   related to the impairment of IPR D assets in fiscal year 2018, and $15 million of humanitarian aid provided to our employees affected by Hurricane Maria in fiscal year 2018. The increase from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was partially offset by $74 million of TSA income. 
  In fiscal year   2017  , other expense, net was $  222 million   as compared to $  107 million   in fiscal year   2016  .  The increase from fiscal year 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to remeasurement and our hedging programs, which resulted in an $81 million gain for fiscal year 2017 as compared to a $314 million gain in fiscal year 2018, partially offset by the decrease in U.S. medical device tax due to the suspension of the U.S. medical device tax beginning January 1, 2016.  
  Investment Loss    We recognized losses of $227 million and $70 million during fiscal years   2018   and   2016  , respectively, related to the impairment of certain cost and equity method investments. We remain committed to future strategic and focused investments in the areas of medical device technologies, services, and solutions.  
   
  Interest Expense, Net     Interest expense, net includes interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts, amortization of gains or losses on terminated or de-designated interest rate derivative instruments, charges recognized in connection with the early redemption of senior notes, and ineffectiveness on interest rate derivative instruments. In fiscal year   2018  , interest expense, net was   $749 million   as compared to   $728 million   in fiscal year   2017  . The increase in interest expense, net for fiscal year   2018   was primarily driven by modestly higher average interest rates on total debt obligations outstanding and a $38 million charge recognized in connection with the early redemption of approximately $1.2 billion of Medtronic Inc. senior notes, partially offset by a slight increase in interest income as compared to fiscal year   2017  .  
  In fiscal year fiscal year   2017  , interest expense, net was   $728 million   as compared to $  955 million   in fiscal year 2016.  The decrease in interest expense, net for fiscal year   2017   was the result of a   $183 million   charge recorded in connection with the cash tender offer and redemption of certain debt securities in fiscal year 2016 and a   $45 million   loss on interest rate swaps which were entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that was no longer anticipated in fiscal year 2016.  
   
  INCOME TAXES 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which significantly revises U.S. corporate income taxation by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent, broadening the base of taxation, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent results in a blended statutory tax rate of 30.5 percent for our fiscal year ended   April 27, 2018  .

     Table of Contents  

Many of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our blended U.S. statutory rate, thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the U.S. statutory rate of 30.5 percent for fiscal year   2018  . A significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, and Ireland. The statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 12.5 percent to 45.1 percent. Our earnings in Puerto Rico and Switzerland are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than the country statutory tax rates. Unless our tax incentive grants are extended, they expire between fiscal years 2019 and 2029. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year   2018   did not have a material impact on our financial results. See Note   14   to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Our effective tax rate for fiscal year   2018   was   45.5 percent  , as compared to   12.6 percent   in fiscal year   2017  . The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from U.S. tax reform, the divestiture of our Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses, the utilization of non-U.S. special deductions, the net tax cost associated with an internal reorganization, excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, and the tax effect from the intercompany sales of certain intellectual property.   
  Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year   2018   was   14.7 percent  , as compared to   16.2 percent   in fiscal year   2017  . The decrease in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year   2018   as compared to fiscal year   2017   was primarily due to operational tax benefits and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction. 
  During fiscal year   2018  , we recognized     $135 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $61 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and a $74 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances. 
  Our effective tax rate for fiscal year   2017   was   12.6 percent  , as compared to   18.4 percent   in fiscal year   2016  . The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year   2017   as compared to fiscal year   2016   was due to the net tax impact of inventory step-up, debt tender premium, certain litigation payments, certain tax adjustments, operational tax benefits described below, and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction. 
  Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year   2017   was   16.2 percent  , as compared to   15.8 percent   in fiscal year   2016  . The increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year   2017   as compared to fiscal year   2016   was primarily due to operational tax benefits and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction. 
  During fiscal year   2017  , we recognized $95 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $44 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses and a $51 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.  
  An increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years    2018  ,   2017  , and   2016   of approximately     $77 million, $76 million, and $74 million, respectively. 
  Certain Tax Adjustments 
  During fiscal year   2018  , certain tax adjustments of $1.9 billion, recognized in   income tax provision   in the consolidated statement of income, included the following: 
             
    A net charge of $2.4 billion associated with U.S. tax reform, inclusive of the transition tax, remeasurement of U.S. Federal deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate. Our income tax provision associated with the impact of the Tax Act for fiscal year   2018   is based on a reasonable estimate and will be finalized within the measurement period in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See Note   14   to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
                
    A charge of $73 million associated with an internal reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries. 
                
    A net benefit of $579 million associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property.   
     During fiscal year   2017  , certain tax adjustments of $202 million, recognized in   income tax provision   in the consolidated statement of income, included the following: 
             
    A charge of $404 million associated with the IRS resolution for the Ardian, CoreValve, Inc., Ablation Frontiers, Inc., PEAK Surgical, Inc. and Salient Surgical Technologies, Inc. acquisition-related issues and the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for certain businesses. This resolution does not include the businesses that are the subject of the Medtronic, Inc. U.S. Tax Court case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. 
     
   47 

     Table of Contents  

A net charge of $125 million associated with the divestiture of our Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal.  The net charge primarily relates to the tax effect from the recognition of the outside basis difference of certain subsidiaries which were included in the divestiture.  
                
    A charge of $86 million associated with the IRS s disallowance of the utilization of certain net operating losses, along with the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net operating loss deferred tax asset, was recognized during the year.  
                
    A charge of $18 million as a result of the redemption of an intercompany minority interest during the year.   
                
    A benefit of $431 million as the result of the resolution of Covidien's previously disclosed Tyco International plc intercompany debt issues with the U.S. Tax Court and the Appeals Division of the IRS.  
     During fiscal year   2016  , certain tax adjustments of $417 million, recognized in   income tax provision   in the consolidated statement of income, included the following: 
             
    A charge of $442 million primarily related to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from our completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy Covidien businesses that reduced the cash and investments held by our U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of this internal reorganization, approximately $9.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities previously held by U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries became available for general corporate purposes.  
                
    A $25 million tax benefit associated with the disposition of a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary.  
     Certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods. Therefore, we consider these Non-GAAP Adjustments. Refer to the "Executive Level Overview" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these adjustments. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Our liquidity and capital structure is evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning process. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, property, plant, and equipment, and other operating costs. We also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, satisfying maturing debt, and acquiring businesses and technology. 
  Summary of Cash Flows 
  The following is a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, and the net change in cash and cash equivalents: 

Operating Activities     The $2.2 billion decrease in net cash provided in fiscal year   2018   as compared to fiscal year   2017   was primarily driven by an increase in cash paid for taxes of $1.5 billion, an increase in net cash outflows for collateral related to our derivative instruments of $145 million, cash paid for divestiture-related expenses of approximately $100 million, an increase in certain litigation payments of $60 million, and a decrease in cash collected from customers. The increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of a $1.1 billion pre-payment we elected to make to the U.S. IRS related to in-process litigation on Puerto Rico transfer pricing, tax payments related to the intercompany sale of intellectual property and sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses as well as settlement payments for U.S. federal income taxes for fiscal years 2012 to 2014 and audit settlements outside of the U.S.  
  The $1.7 billion increase in net cash provided in fiscal year   2017   as compared to fiscal year   2016   was primarily attributable to an increase in cash collected from customers, as well as a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest of $350 million and  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  

$132 million, respectively, and a $191 million payment in fiscal year 2016 related to the Covidien Tax Sharing Agreement. The increase in cash collected from customers was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue. The decrease in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of payments made for the resolution of the Kyphon acquisition-related matters, as well as Covidien income tax extension payments in fiscal year 2016. We did not make any significant tax audit settlement payments or significant extension payments in fiscal year 2017. The decrease in cash paid for interest was the result of less debt, on average, in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016.  
  Investing Activities    The $7.4 billion increase in net cash provided in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to the sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses on July 29, 2017, resulting in net proceeds of $6.1 billion, a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1.2 billion, primarily due to the acquisition of Heartware during fiscal year 2017, and a decrease in additions to property, plant, and equipment. 
  The $3.8 billion increase in net cash used in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from purchases and sales and maturities of investments in fiscal year 2017. 
  Financing Activities       The $8.7 billion increase in net cash used in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to the repayment of our senior unsecured term loan, including accrued interest, for $3.0 billion in August 2017, the repayment of our 6.000 percent ten-year 2008 CIFSA senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.2 billion in October 2017, the repayment of our 3.500 percent seven-year 2010 HTWR senior notes, including accrued interest, for $43 million in December 2017, the repayment of our 1.500 percent three-year 2015 senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.0 billion in March 2018, repayment of our 1.375 percent five-year 2013 senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.0 billion in April 2018, repayment of our 4.450 percent ten-year 2010 senior notes, including accrued interest and early redemption premium, for $795 million in April 2018, and repayment of our 5.600 percent ten-year 2009 senior notes, including accrued interest and early redemption premium, for $413 million in April 2018. The increase in net cash used was also due to the issuance of $2.0 billion of Senior Notes in fiscal year 2017 and a reduction of commercial paper borrowings in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017, partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of $1.4 billion. 
  The $6.3 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to the issuance of $2.0 billion of Senior Notes in fiscal year 2017, an increase in commercial paper borrowings, and lower payments on maturing and extinguished debt, partially offset by increases in dividends to shareholders and repurchases of ordinary shares.  
  Free Cash Flow  
  Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows:

Debt and Capital 
  Our capital structure consists of equity and interest-bearing debt. We use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our short-term financing needs. Current debt, including the current portion of our long-term debt and capital lease obligations, at   April 27, 2018   was   $2.1 billion   as compared to   $7.5 billion   at   April 28, 2017  . Historically, we have issued Senior Notes to meet our long-term financing needs. Long-term debt at   April 27, 2018   was   $23.7 billion   as compared to   $25.9 billion   at   April 28, 2017  .  
  Total debt at   April 27, 2018   was   $25.8 billion  , as compared to   $33.4 billion   at   April 28, 2017  . The decrease in total debt was primarily driven by the repayment of our senior unsecured term loan and senior notes detailed below, along with a reduction in our commercial paper borrowings of   $203 million  . 
  During fiscal year 2018, we repaid our senior unsecured term loan, including accrued interest, for $3.0 billion, our 6.000 percent ten-year 2008 CIFSA senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.2 billion, our 3.500 percent seven-year 2010 HTWR senior notes, including interest, for $43 million, our 1.500 percent three-year 2015 senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.0 billion, our 1.375 percent five-year 2013 senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.0 billion, our 4.450 percent ten-year 2010 senior notes, including accrued interest and early redemption premium, for $795 million, and our 5.600 percent ten-year 2009 senior notes, including accrued interest and early redemption premium, for $413 million. 
  We maintain a commercial paper program for short-term financing, which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.5 billion. At   April 27, 2018  , we had   $698 million   of commercial paper outstanding as compared to   $901 million   at   April 28, 2017  . During fiscal years   2018   and   2017  , the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately   28   and   39   days, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate was   1.46 percent   and   0.89 percent  , respectively. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit, as explained below. 
  We also have a $3.5 billion syndicated line of credit facility (Credit Facility) which expires in January 2020. The Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional $500 million at any time during the term of the agreement. At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility, but not more than twice prior to the maturity date, we could also request a one-year extension of the maturity date. At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , no amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit. 
  Interest rates on advances of our Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix, based on our long-term debt ratings assigned by S P and Moody s. For additional information on our credit ratings status by S P and Moody's, refer to the "Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. The agreements also contain customary covenants, all of which we were in compliance with at   April 27, 2018  . 
  We repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In June 2015, our Board of Directors authorized, subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves, the repurchase of 80 million of our ordinary shares. At   April 28, 2017  , we had used 51 million of the 80 million shares authorized under the June 2015 share repurchase program. In June 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $5.0 billion for new share repurchases, replacing the previous 2015 repurchase authorization to redeem up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares. During fiscal years   2018   and   2017  , we repurchased a total of   25 million   and   43 million   shares, respectively, under these programs at an average price of   $83.71   and   $83.03  , respectively. At   April 27, 2018  , we had approximately $4.0 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors.

Liquidity 
  The following table is a summary of our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, working capital, and current ratio:    

           (1) 
    The ratio of current assets to current liabilities. The current ratio at April 28, 2017 excludes current assets and current liabilities held for sale.  
     Our liquidity sources at   April 27, 2018   include $3.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $7.6 billion of current investments.  Additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program ($698 million of commercial paper outstanding at April 27, 2018) and Credit Facility. See discussion above regarding changes in our cash and cash equivalents and commercial paper program and Credit Facility. 
  Our current investments include marketable debt and equity securities that are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Our debt and equity securities include U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, debt funds, equity securities, and auction rate securities. Some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand. Our auction rate security holdings continue to experience reduced liquidity due to low investor demand. Although our auction rate securities are currently illiquid and other securities could become illiquid, we believe we could liquidate a substantial amount of our portfolio without incurring a material impairment loss. 
  For fiscal year   2018  , the total other-than-temporary impairment losses on available-for-sale debt securities and funds were not significant. Based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested, we believe we have recognized all necessary other-than-temporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell, before recovery of the amortized cost. At   April 27, 2018  , we have   $321 million   of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate available-for-sale debt securities and funds of   $7.6 billion  . If market conditions deteriorate, some of these holdings may experience other-than-temporary impairment in the future, which could adversely affect our financial results. We are required to use estimates and assumptions in our valuation of investments, which requires a high degree of judgment, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from estimates. See Note   6   to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  
  Our working capital and current ratio at   April 27, 2018   increased as compared to   April 28, 2017  , primarily due to the receipt of $6.1 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses on July 29, 2017, partially offset by repayments of current and long-term debt obligations and a $1.1 billion income tax pre-payment we elected to make to the U.S. IRS related to in-process litigation on Puerto Rico transfer pricing in fiscal year 2018. 
  The following table is a summary of our Standard and Poor's Rating Services (S P) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings: 

(1) 
    Agency ratings are subject to change, and there is no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings and/or maintain its current ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
       
  S P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at   April 27, 2018   were unchanged as compared to the ratings at   April 28, 2017  . We do not expect the S P and Moody's ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet and Credit Facility and related commercial paper program.

We have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business. We believe our off-balance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. Refer to the "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Long-Term Contractual Obligations" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for more information on these obligations and commitments.  
  Note   19   to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 
  We record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries (to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax); however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, we have removed our permanently reinvested assertion on the historical earnings through   April 27, 2018   for legal entities with accumulated earnings subject to the transition tax. We continue to evaluate our permanently reinvested assertion for certain legal entities. We expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future. In addition, we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations, and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure, we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations. 
  We believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and that our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, as well as our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and related commercial paper program (  $698 million   of commercial paper outstanding at   April 27, 2018  ), will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs for at least the next 12 months. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements.  
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
  In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. Our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated, and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table below. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements.

Presented below is a summary of our off-balance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at   April 27, 2018  , as well as long-term contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at   April 27, 2018  . 

(1) 
    Includes commitments related to the funding of cost or equity method investments, estimated milestone payments, and royalty obligations. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in the table reflect our best estimates.  
              (2) 
    Includes the contractual interest payments on our outstanding debt and excludes the impacts of debt premium and discount amortization and interest rate swap agreements. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements. 
              (3) 
    Includes inventory purchase commitments and research and development arrangements which are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities or spending amounts. These purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. Excludes open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year. 
              (4) 
    Includes the current and non-current portion of our Senior Notes and bank borrowings. Excludes debt premium and discount, the fair value impact of outstanding interest rate swap agreements, unamortized gains from terminated interest rate swap agreements, and commercial paper. See Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements and interest rate swap agreements, respectively. 
              (5) 
    Includes the fair value of our current and non-current portions of contingent consideration. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect our best estimates.  
              (6) 
    Represents the tax obligations associated with the transition tax that resulted from U.S. Tax Reform. The transition tax will be paid over an eight-year period and will not accrue interest. See Note   14   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 
              (7) 
    Excludes defined benefit plan obligations, guarantee obligations, uncertain tax positions, non-current tax liabilities, and litigation settlements for which we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement. For further information, see Notes   14  ,   16  , and   19   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8.

  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK 
  Due to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes. 
  The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017   was   $11.5 billion   and   $10.8 billion  , respectively. At   April 27, 2018  , these contracts were in a net unrealized loss position of $159 million. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at   April 27, 2018   indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase/decrease by approximately $879 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.  
  INTEREST RATE RISK 
  We are subject to interest rate risk on our short-term investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at   April 27, 2018   was comprised of debt predominately denominated in U.S. dollars, of which approximately 95% is fixed rate debt and approximately 5% is floating-rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities, fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, and forward starting interest rate swap agreements.  
  A sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates, as compared to interest rates at   April 27, 2018  , indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by $81 million.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
    
  To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Medtronic plc: 
    
  Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Medtronic plc and its subsidiaries as of April 27, 2018 and April 28, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 27, 2018, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended April 27, 2018 appearing under Item 15(a)(1) (collectively referred to as the  consolidated financial statements ).  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 27, 2018, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).   
    
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 27, 2018 and April 28, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 27, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 27, 2018, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013) issued by the COSO. 
    
  Basis for Opinions 
    
  The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.   
    
  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
    
  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 1963.

1  .   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Nature of Operations     Medtronic plc (Medtronic or the Company) is a global leader in medical technology   alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. The Company provides innovative products and therapies to serve hospitals, physicians, clinicians, and patients. Medtronic was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.  
  Principles of Consolidation     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medtronic plc, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been fully eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year.  
  Certain consolidated balance sheet amounts related to prior periods have been revised to correct the Company s application of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, with respect to its accrual for the costs of post-implant support services which are inconsequential deliverables within the arrangements. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, Materiality, and ASC 250, Presentation of Financial Statements, the Company assessed the materiality of this correction and concluded that the accrual for the costs of post-implant support services was not material to prior periods, and therefore, amendments of previously filed reports are not required.  
    
  As such, in accordance with ASC 250, the Company revised the previously reported consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of equity. The correction had no impact on the previously reported consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, or consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented, as this error originates in periods prior to those presented. The table below presents the impact of the revision on the Company's previously reported consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of equity, and related amounts disclosed in Notes 14, 21, and 22 as follows: 

As this error originates in periods prior to those presented, previously reported amounts at April 24, 2015 and April 29, 2016 of retained earnings (  $20,305 million   and   $21,704 million  , respectively), total shareholders' equity (  $53,230 million   and   $52,063 million  , respectively) and total equity (  $53,230 million   and   $52,063 million  , respectively), have been reduced by   $86 million   to reflect the correction above within the consolidated statements of equity. 
  Use of Estimates     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting for items such as  income taxes, contingencies, intangible asset, and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. 
  Fiscal Year-End     The Company utilizes a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending the last Friday in April, for the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017   and for each of the three fiscal years ended   April 27, 2018   (fiscal year   2018  ),   April 28, 2017   (fiscal year   2017  ), and   April 29, 2016   (fiscal year   2016  ). Fiscal years   2018   and   2017   were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year, with the additional week occurring in the first quarter.  
  Cash Equivalents     The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Investments     Investments in marketable equity securities and certain debt securities, which include corporate debt securities, government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, debt funds, and auction rate securities, are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value for available-for-sale securities is recorded, net of taxes, as a component of   accumulated other comprehensive loss   on the consolidated balance sheets. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. The classification of marketable securities as current or long-term is based on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in current operations consistent with the Company's management of its capital structure and liquidity.  
  Certain of the Company s investments in equity and other securities are long-term, strategic investments in companies that are in various stages of development. These investments are included in   other assets   on the consolidated balance sheets. If an investment has no quoted market price, the Company accounts for these investments under the cost or the equity method of accounting. Certain of these investments are publicly traded companies and are accounted for as available-for-sale. The valuation of equity and other securities accounted for under the cost method considers all available financial information related to the investee, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. If an unrealized loss for any investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period the determination is made. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company s investment and are adjusted each period for the Company s share of the investee s income or loss and dividends paid. Securities accounted for under the cost and equity methods are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company s investment may not be recoverable. See Note   6   for a discussion of the gains and losses recognized on equity and other securities. 
  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts     The Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. When evaluating allowances for doubtful accounts, the Company considers various factors, including historical experience and customer-specific information. Uncollectible accounts are written-off against the allowance when it is deemed that a customer account is uncollectible. 
  Inventories     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories for items that are potentially excess, obsolete, or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments, or other economic factors.  
  Property, Plant, and Equipment     Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment asset groupings may not be recoverable. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the various assets. The cost of interest that is incurred in connection with ongoing construction projects is capitalized using a weighted average interest rate. These costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and amortized over the useful life of the related asset.  
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets    Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level. There were no changes in reporting units during fiscal year 2018. The test for impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The Company calculated the excess of each reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount, including goodwill, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.  
  Intangible assets include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and in-process research and development (IPR D). Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives ranging from   three   to   20 years  . Amortization is recognized within   amortization of intangible assets   in the consolidated statements of income. Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable, the Company calculates the excess of an intangible asset's carrying value over its undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The inputs used in the fair value analysis fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in  
  
   63 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis. 
  Acquired IPR D represents the fair value assigned to those research and development (R D) projects in development that were acquired in a business combination for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. IPR D is capitalized at its fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and any development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The fair value of IPR D is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each R D project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. Upon achieving regulatory approval or commercial viability for the related technology or product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related technology or product. If the R D project is not completed or the related R D project is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment related to the IPR D which is charged to expense.  
  Contingent Consideration     Certain of the Company s business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. The Company records contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred, estimated as the probability-weighted future cash flows, discounted back to present value. The fair value of contingent consideration is measured using projected payment dates, discount rates, probabilities of payment, and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected revenues are based on the Company s most recent internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies. Changes in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates, and projected payment dates may result in adjustments to the fair value measurements. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is recognized as income or expense within   acquisition-related items   in the consolidated statements of income. Contingent consideration payments made soon after the acquisition date are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Contingent consideration payments not made soon after the acquisition date that are related to the acquisition date fair value are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and amounts paid in excess of the original acquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  Derivatives        The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging, and presents assets and liabilities associated with derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. See Note   9   for more information on the Company's derivative instruments and hedging programs. 
  Fair Value Measurements     The Company follows the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability, based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows: 
             
    Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
                
    Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. 
     Financial assets that are classified as Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds within U.S. government and agency securities and marketable equity securities for which quoted market prices are available. In addition, the Company classifies currency forward contracts as Level 1 since they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets which have identical assets or liabilities. 
  
   64

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The valuation for most fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2. Financial assets that are classified as Level 2 include corporate debt securities, government and agency securities, other asset-backed securities, debt funds, and mortgage-backed securities whose value is determined using inputs that are observable in the market or may be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data such as pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, cash flow models with yield curves, and benchmark securities. In addition, interest rate swaps and total return swaps are included in Level 2 as the Company uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis. 
  Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Financial assets that are classified as Level 3 financial assets include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation, certain corporate debt securities and auction rate securities. With the exception of auction rate securities, these securities are valued using third-party pricing sources that incorporate transaction details such as contractual terms, maturity, timing, and amount of expected future cash flows, as well as assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation adjustments by market participants. The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated by the Company using a discounted cash flow model, which incorporates significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s auction rate securities are years to principal recovery and the illiquidity premium that is incorporated into the discount rate.  
  Certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient include certain debt funds, equity and fixed income commingled trusts, and registered investment companies. 
  Self-Insurance     The Company self-insures the majority of its insurable risks, including medical and dental costs, disability coverage, physical loss to property, business interruptions, workers  compensation, comprehensive general, and product liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company uses claims data and historical experience, as applicable, to estimate liabilities associated with the exposures that the Company has self-insured.  
  Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions     The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. See Note   16   for assumptions used in determining pension and post-retirement benefit costs.  
  The Company utilizes a full yield curve approach methodology to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the Company s pension and other post-retirement benefits. The full yield curve approach applies specific spot rates along the yield curve to their underlying projected cash flows in estimation of the cost components.  
  Revenue Recognition     The Company sells its products through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. Additionally, a portion of the Company s revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals or with field representatives. The Company recognizes revenue when control is transferred to a customer. For products sold through direct sales representatives and independent distributors, control is transferred upon shipment or upon delivery, based on the contract terms and legal requirements. For consignment inventory, revenue is recognized at the time the product has been used or implanted.  
  The amount of revenue recognized reflects estimated sales rebates and returns, which are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. The Company adjusts reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and records such adjustment as increases or decrease of revenue in the period of adjustment. 
  In certain circumstances, the Company enters into arrangements in which multiple deliverables are provided to customers. Under multiple deliverable arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the principles described above and allocates the revenue based on the relative selling price of each deliverable, which is based on vendor specific objective evidence.  
  Shipping and Handling     Shipping and handling costs incurred to physically move product from the Company's premises to the customer's premises are recognized in   selling, general, and administrative expense   in the consolidated statements of income and were   $363 million  ,   $370 million  , and   $316 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. Other shipping and handling costs incurred to store, move, and prepare products for shipment are recognized in   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Research and Development     Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs include costs of other research, engineering, and technical activities to develop a new product or service or make significant improvement to an existing product or manufacturing process. Research and development costs also include pre-approval regulatory and clinical trial expenses. 
  Contingencies    The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. Insurance recoveries related to potential claims are recognized up to the amount of the recorded liability when coverage is confirmed and the estimated recoveries are probable of payment. These recoveries are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation. 
  Income Taxes    The Company has deferred taxes that arise as a result of the different treatment of transactions for U.S. GAAP and income tax accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years for which the Company has already recognized the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense for which payment has been deferred or expense has already been taken as a deduction on the Company s tax return but has not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income.  
  Other Expense, Net       Other expense, net   includes royalty income and expense, realized equity security gains and losses, intangible asset impairments, currency transaction and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise tax, and other income not central to the Company's operations. 
  Currency Translation     Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the currency impacts arising from the translation of the assets and liabilities are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment, a component of   accumulated other comprehensive loss,   on the consolidated balance sheets. Elements of the consolidated statements of income are translated at the average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in   other expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income. 
  Stock-Based Compensation     The Company measures stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are expected to vest. The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revises the estimates in subsequent periods. 
  New Accounting Standards 
  Recently Adopted 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions by requiring all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in income tax expense or benefit in earnings; eliminating the requirement to classify the excess tax benefits and deficiencies as additional paid-in capital. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits are to be classified in operating activities in the statement of cash flows rather than financing. Under the new guidance, an entity makes an accounting policy election to either estimate the expected forfeiture awards or account for forfeitures as they occur. The standard also allows an entity to withhold up to the maximum statutory tax rate and classify the awards as equity. The Company prospectively adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company has elected to continue to estimate forfeitures. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires the tax effect of intra-entity transactions, other than sales of inventory, to be recognized when the transaction occurs. Previously, U.S. GAAP prohibited the recognition of current and deferred income taxes associated with an intra-entity asset transfer until an asset had been sold to a third-party. This update requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, such as equipment or intangibles, when the transfer occurs. The adoption of this guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company has early-adopted this guidance, as permitted, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. As a result of this adoption, the Company increased its beginning retained earnings by   $296 million  .

In February 2018, the FASB issued accounting guidance which allows for reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the enactment of comprehensive U.S. tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), and can be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to all applicable periods. The Company early-adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and reclassified the stranded income tax effects of the Tax Act, increasing the accumulated other comprehensive loss by   $203 million   with a corresponding increase to retained earnings. The reclassification was primarily comprised of amounts relating to retirement benefit plans and available-for-sale securities. In accordance with its accounting policy, the Company releases other disproportionate income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss once the reason the tax effects were established ceases to exist. 
  In March 2018, the FASB issued accounting guidance which incorporates Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 into U.S. GAAP, allowing a measurement period, not to exceed one year, to finalize the accounting for the income tax impacts of the Tax Act. This guidance is effective immediately and requires adjustments to provisional amounts that were previously recorded as new information becomes available. The Company has adopted this standard and will continue to evaluate indicators that may give rise to a change in the tax provision as a result of the Tax Act. 
  Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued amended revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and may be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). The Company will adopt this guidance under the modified retrospective method. The Company does not expect the adoption of the amended guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company will make additional revenue related disclosures in the footnotes to the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The guidance also includes a simplified impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values and presentation and disclosure changes. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company expects a reclassification of approximately   $83 million  , net of taxes, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the lease guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and anticipates recording additional assets and corresponding liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets related to operating leases within its lease portfolio upon adoption of the guidance. 
   
  2  .   Acquisitions and Acquisition-Related Items    
  The Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities of businesses acquired are recorded and consolidated on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to future yet to be defined technologies, new customer relationships, existing workforce of the acquired businesses, and synergies expected to arise after the Company's acquisition of the business. The pro forma impact of acquisitions during fiscal year   2018   was not significant, either individually or in the aggregate, to the results of the Company. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in the Company s consolidated statements of income since the date each business was acquired.

On August 23, 2016, the Company's Cardiac and Vascular Group acquired HeartWare International, Inc. (HeartWare), a medical device company that develops and manufactures miniaturized implantable heart pumps, or ventricular assist devices, to treat patients around the world suffering from advanced heart failure. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately   $1.1 billion  . Based upon an acquisition valuation, the Company acquired   $602 million   of technology-based and customer-related intangible assets and   $23 million   of tradenames, with estimated useful lives of   15   and   5   years, respectively, and   $481 million   of goodwill. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company acquired   $245 million   of debt through the acquisition, of which the Company redeemed   $203 million   as part of a cash tender offer in August 2016, and the remaining   $42 million   of debt acquired was repaid in December 2017. During the measurement period, which ended on August 22, 2017, adjustments were made to finalize the allocation of purchase price related to other assets, goodwill, and contingent liabilities. 
  The acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities acquired were as follows:

Acquisition-Related Items 
  Acquisition-related items includes expenses incurred in connection with the integration of Covidien, the Company's   $50.0 billion   acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, transaction expenses incurred in connection with business acquisitions, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. During fiscal year   2018  , the Company recognized acquisition-related items expense of   $132 million  , including   $28 million   recognized within   cost of products sold  ,     in the consolidated statements of income. During fiscal year   2018  , acquisition-related items expense includes   $172 million   of costs associated with the integration of Covidien manufacturing, distribution, and administrative facilities, as well as information technology system implementation and benefits harmonization, partially offset by changes in fair value of contingent consideration as a result of revised revenue forecasts and the timing of anticipated regulatory milestones. 
  During fiscal year   2017  , the Company recognized acquisition-related items expense of   $230 million  , including   $10 million   recognized within   cost of products sold  ,     in the consolidated statements of income. During fiscal year   2017  , acquisition-related items expense includes   $225 million   of costs associated with the integration of Covidien manufacturing, distribution, and administrative facilities, as well as information technology system implementation and benefits harmonization,   $23 million   of  accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense, and expenses incurred in connection with the HeartWare acquisition and planned divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein, Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses, partially offset by changes in fair value of contingent consideration as a result of revised revenue forecasts and the timing of anticipated regulatory milestones.  
  During fiscal year 2016, the Company recognized acquisition-related items expense of   $283 million  , including   $219 million   of costs associated with the integration of Covidien manufacturing, distribution, and administrative facilities, as well as information technology system implementation and benefits harmonization, and   $58 million   of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense. 
  Contingent Consideration 
  The fair value of contingent consideration at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017   was   $173 million   and   $246 million  , respectively. At   April 27, 2018  ,   $65 million   was reflected in   other liabilities   and   $108 million   was reflected in   other accrued expenses   in the consolidated balance sheets. At   April 28, 2017  ,   $180 million   was reflected in   other liabilities   and   $66 million   was reflected in   other accrued expenses   in the consolidated balance sheets.

3  .   Divestiture and Divestiture-Related Items    
  Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency Businesses 
  In April 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group segment to Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal).  The divestiture was completed on July 29, 2017. As a result of the transaction, the Company received proceeds of   $6.1 billion  , which was recorded in     proceeds from sale of businesses     in the consolidated statements of cash flows and recognized a before-tax gain of     $697 million  , which was recognized within     gain on sale of businesses     in the consolidated statements of income. Among the product lines included in the divestiture were the dental and animal health, chart paper, wound care, incontinence, electrodes, SharpSafety, thermometry, perinatal protection, blood collection, compression, and enteral feeding offerings. The divestiture also included     17     dedicated manufacturing sites. In connection with the transaction, the Company entered into Transition Service Agreements (TSAs) and Transition Manufacturing Agreements (TMAs) with Cardinal designed to ensure and facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations. The TSAs are primarily related to administrative services and continue for     12     months from the divestiture date, with some TSAs extendable beyond the original     12     month period per the original agreement. Certain of the TSAs have been extended beyond the initial     12     month period in accordance with the provisions of the original agreement. Under the TMAs, both the Company and Cardinal will manufacture and supply certain products to each other for a transition period of up to     5     years. 
  The divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations, and as such, the results of operations of these businesses were included within net income through the date of the divestiture. The Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, at which time the Company ceased depreciation and amortization of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets classified as held for sale. The following table presents information related to the assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets: 

Divestiture-Related Items 
  Divestiture-related items include expenses incurred in connection with the divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses. During fiscal year     2018  , the Company recognized divestiture-related items expense of     $114 million  , primarily comprised of expenses incurred for professional services, including banker, legal, tax, and advisory fees, and     $16 million     of accelerated stock compensation expense related to the acceleration of the vesting period for employees that transferred with the divestiture.   There was   no   divestiture-related items expense for fiscal years   2017   or   2016  .

4  .   Restructuring Charges    
  Enterprise Excellence 
  In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company announced its Enterprise Excellence restructuring program, which is expected to leverage the Company's global size and scale, as well as enhance the customer and employee experience, with a focus on three objectives: global operations, functional optimization, and commercial optimization. Primary activities of the restructuring program include integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes, systems and site presence, enhancing and leveraging global operating models across several enabling functions, and optimizing certain commercial processes, systems, and models. 
  The Company estimates that, in connection with its Enterprise Excellence restructuring program, it will recognize pre-tax exit and disposal costs and other costs associated with the restructuring program across all segments of approximately   $1.6 billion   to   $1.8 billion  , the majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately half of the estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining restructuring charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses. These charges are recognized within   restructuring charges, net, cost of products sold,   and   selling, general, and administrative expense   in the consolidated statements of income. During fiscal year 2018, the Company recognized   $96 million   in charges. 
  The following table summarizes the activity related to the Enterprise Excellence restructuring program for fiscal year   2018  :  

(1) 
    Associated costs include costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses. For fiscal year 2018,   $28 million   was recognized within   cost of products sold   and   $33 million   was recognized within   selling, general, and administrative expense   in the consolidated statements of income. 
     Cost Synergies 
  The cost synergies program related to administrative office optimization, manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, and certain general and administrative savings was achieved as part of the Covidien integration and completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Restructuring charges incurred throughout the life of the initiative affecting all segments were primarily related to employee termination costs and costs related to manufacturing and facility closures.

A summary of the restructuring accrual and related activity is presented below: 

For fiscal year     2018  , the Company recognized   $45 million   in charges, partially offset by accrual adjustments of   $34 million  . Accrual adjustments related to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within the Company, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination benefits being less than initially estimated. For fiscal year   2018  , charges included   $12 million   recognized within   cost of products sold   and   $4 million   recognized within   selling, general and administrative expense   in the consolidated statements of income. 
  For fiscal year   2017  , the Company recognized   $441 million   in charges, which included   $73 million   of incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages. These costs are not included in the table summarizing the restructuring costs above, because they are associated with costs that are accounted for under the pension and post-retirement rules. See Note   16   for further discussion on the incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses. The charges recognized during fiscal year   2017   were partially offset by accrual adjustments of   $68 million  . Accrual adjustments relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within the Company, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination benefits being less than initially estimated. For fiscal year   2017  , asset write-downs included   $17 million   of property, plant, and equipment impairments. Fiscal year    2017   asset write-downs also included   $10 million   of inventory write-offs of discontinued product lines recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. 
  For fiscal year 2016, the Company recognized   $332 million   in charges, partially offset by accrual adjustments of   $18 million  . Accrual adjustments relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within the Company, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination benefits being less than initially estimated. For fiscal year 2016, asset write-downs included   $14 million   of property, plant, and equipment impairments. Fiscal year 2016 assets write-downs also included   $9 million   of inventory write-offs of discontinued product lines recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. 
   
  5  .   Special Charge     
  Continuing the Company's commitment to improve the health of people and communities throughout the world, the Company recognized a charge of   $80 million   in fiscal year   2018   and   $100 million   in fiscal year   2017   for charitable contributions to the Medtronic Foundation.

  The following tables present the gross unrealized losses and fair values of the Company s available-for-sale securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position deemed to be temporary, aggregated by investment category, at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  :

The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurs. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during fiscal years   2018   or   2017  . When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

The following tables provide a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of items measured at fair value on a recurring basis that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

Activity related to the Company s investment portfolio was as follows:   

           (1) 
    Includes available-for-sale debt securities and debt funds. 
              (2) 
    Includes marketable equity securities, cost method, equity method, exchange-traded funds, and other investments. 
     Credit losses represent the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected on certain mortgage-backed securities and auction rate securities and the amortized cost of these securities. Based on the Company s assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which the Company is invested, the Company believes it has recognized all necessary other-than-temporary impairments as the Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, before recovery of the amortized cost.  
  At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , the credit loss portion of other-than temporary impairments on debt securities was   no  t significant. The total reductions for available-for-sale debt securities sold during fiscal years   2018   and   2017     were   no  t significant.  
  The   April 27, 2018   balance of available-for-sale debt securities, excluding debt funds which have no single maturity date, by contractual maturity is shown in the following table. Within the table, maturities of mortgage-backed securities have been allocated based upon timing of estimated cash flows assuming no change in the current interest rate environment. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities, because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties. 

The Company holds investments in marketable equity securities, which are classified as   other assets   in the consolidated balance sheets. At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , the aggregate carrying amount of these investments was   $162 million   and   $103 million  , respectively. The Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges related to marketable equity securities during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , or   2016  .

Cost Method, Equity Method, and Other Investments 
  The Company holds investments in equity and other securities that are accounted for using the cost or equity method, which are classified as   other assets   in the consolidated balance sheets. At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , the aggregate carrying amount of equity and other securities accounted for using the cost or equity method was   $353 million   and   $589 million  , respectively. Cost and equity method investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company s investment may not be recoverable are assessed quarterly. If events or changes in circumstances are identified that may have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, the investment is assessed for impairment. Cost and equity method investments are included within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. To determine the fair value of these investments, the Company uses all pertinent financial information available related to the investees, including financial statements, market participant valuations from recent and proposed equity offerings, and other third-party data.  
  During fiscal year   2018  , the Company received bids from potential buyers and investors for some or all of its ownership in a portfolio of selected investments, which indicated that the fair values of certain of the underlying cost and equity method investments in the portfolio may be below the respective carrying values. The Company determined that the decline in the fair values was other-than-temporary given the uncertainty regarding the Company s intent to hold the investments for a period of time that would be sufficient to recover the carrying values. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges of   $227 million   during fiscal year   2018  , which were recognized within   investment loss   in the consolidated statements of income. The fair values of the investments were determined based on Level 3 inputs. The carrying value of the investments prior to recognizing the impairment charges was   $317 million  . In April 2018, the Company transferred the portfolio of investments into a newly created, wholly-owned entity. In a subsequent transaction, the Company sold a significant interest in the new entity in exchange for cash proceeds of   $72 million  . The Company s remaining investment in the entity of   $18 million   is accounted for using the equity method.   No   gain or loss was recognized on the transaction. 
  During fiscal year   2016  , the Company recognized an impairment charge of   $70 million   related to the impairment of a debt investment accounted for using the cost method, which was recognized within   investment loss   in the consolidated statements of income. There were no other significant impairment charges recognized during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  .  
   
  7  .   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    
  Goodwill 
  The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment:  

The Company did   no  t recognize any goodwill impairments during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , or   2016  .

Intangible Assets 
  The following table presents the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets: 

The Company did   no  t recognize any definite-lived intangible asset impairments during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , or   2016  . During fiscal year   2018  , the Company recognized impairment losses on indefinite-lived intangibles of   $68 million   as a result of the discontinuation of certain IPR D projects within the Restorative Therapies Group segment, which were recognized within   other expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income. The Company did   no  t recognize any significant indefinite-lived asset impairments during fiscal years   2017   or   2016  . Due to the nature of IPR D projects, the Company may experience future delays or failures to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, failures of such clinical trials, delays or failures to obtain required market clearances or other failures to achieve a commercially viable product, or the discontinuation of certain projects, and as a result, may recognize impairment losses in the future.  
  Amortization 
  Intangible asset amortization expense for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016   was   $1.8 billion  ,   $2.0 billion  , and   $1.9 billion  , respectively. Estimated aggregate amortization expense by fiscal year based on the current carrying value and remaining estimated useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets at   April 27, 2018  , excluding any possible future amortization associated with acquired IPR D which has not met technological feasibility, is as follows:

8  .   Financing Arrangements    
  Current debt obligations consisted of the following:   

  Bank Borrowings     Outstanding bank borrowings at   April 27, 2018   were short-term advances to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries under credit agreements with various banks. Bank borrowings consist primarily of borrowings in Japanese Yen at interest rates ranging from   0.17%   to   0.21%  , and the borrowing is a natural hedge of currency and exchange rate risk.  
  Commercial Paper    On January 26, 2015, Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A. (Medtronic Luxco), an entity organized under the laws of Luxembourg, entered into various agreements pursuant to which Medtronic Luxco may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the 2015 Commercial Paper Program) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of   $3.5 billion  . The Company and Medtronic, Inc. have guaranteed the obligations of Medtronic Luxco under the 2015 Commercial Paper Program.  
  Commercial paper outstanding at   April 27, 2018   was   $698 million  , as compared to   $901 million   at   April 28, 2017  . During fiscal years   2018   and   2017  , the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately   28 days   and   39 days  , respectively, and the weighted average interest rate was   1.46 percent   and   0.89 percent  , respectively. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under the Company's existing Credit Facility, defined below.  
  Line of Credit     The Company has a   $3.5 billion     five   year revolving syndicated line of credit facility (Credit Facility), by and among Medtronic, Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic Luxco, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and issuing bank, which expires in January 2020. The Credit Facility provides the Company with the ability to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional   $500 million   at any time during the term of the agreement. At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility, but not more than twice prior to the maturity date, the Company could also request a   one  -year extension of the maturity date. The Company, Medtronic Luxco, and Medtronic, Inc. guarantee the obligations under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  ,   no   amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit. 
  Interest rates on advances on the Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix, based on the Company s long-term debt ratings, assigned by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services and Moody s Investors Service. Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. The agreements also contain customary covenants, all of which the Company remained in compliance with at   April 27, 2018  . 
  Term Loan     On January 26, 2015, Medtronic, Inc. borrowed   $3.0 billion   for a term of   three   years under a senior unsecured term loan credit agreement (the  Term Loan Credit Agreement ), among Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic, Medtronic Luxco, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement was entered into to finance, in part, the cash component of the acquisition of Covidien and certain transaction expenses. Medtronic and Medtronic Luxco provided guarantees of the obligations of Medtronic, Inc. under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. During fiscal year   2018  , the Company repaid its senior unsecured term loan, including interest, for   $3.0 billion  .

Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

Senior Notes     The Company has outstanding unsecured senior obligations, described as senior notes in the tables above (collectively, the Senior Notes). The Senior Notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indentures under which the Senior Notes were issued contain customary covenants, all of which the Company remained in compliance with at   April 27, 2018  . The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes primarily for general corporate purposes, which includes the repayment of other indebtedness of the Company. 
  In April 2018, the Company completed an early redemption of approximately   $1.2 billion   of Senior Notes for   $1.2 billion   of total consideration. The Company recognized a loss on the debt redemption of   $38 million  , which included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs. The loss was recognized in   interest expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income.  
  In March 2017, Medtronic Luxco issued   two   tranches of Senior Notes with an aggregate face value of   $1.850 billion   (collectively, the   2017 Senior Notes  ). The first tranche consisted of   $1.0 billion   of   1.700 percent   Senior Notes due in fiscal year 2019. The

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

second tranche consisted of   $850 million   of   3.350 percent   Senior Notes due in fiscal year 2027. Concurrent with the offering by Medtronic Luxco, Medtronic, Inc. issued   $150 million   in principal amount of its   4.625 percent   Senior Notes due in fiscal year 2045 (the   Reopening Notes  ). The   Reopening Notes   are a further issuance of, and form a single series with, the   $4.0 billion   principal amount of Medtronic, Inc.'s previously outstanding   4.625 percent   Senior Notes due in fiscal year 2045. Interest on the   2017 Senior Notes   and the   Reopening Notes   is payable semi-annually. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the   2017 Senior Notes   and the   Reopening Notes   for general corporate purposes.  
  In April 2016, the Company completed a cash tender offer and redemption of   $2.7 billion   of Senior Notes for   $3.0 billion   of total consideration. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of   $163 million  , which included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in   interest expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income. In addition to the loss on debt extinguishment, we recognized a loss of   $20 million   due to the acceleration of net losses on forward starting interest rate derivatives, which were terminated at the time of original debt issuances relating to the portion of debt extinguished in the tender offer, which was recognized in   interest expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income.   
  At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , the Company had interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges of certain underlying fixed-rate obligations, including the Company s   $500 million     4.125 percent   2011 Senior Notes and   $675 million     3.125 percent   2012 Senior Notes. Refer to Note   9   for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements. 
  Contractual maturities of debt for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, excluding deferred financing costs, debt premium, net, and the fair value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements are as follows: 

Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value 
  At   April 27, 2018  , the estimated fair value of the Company s Senior Notes was   $25.1 billion   compared to a principal value of   $24.5 billion  . At   April 28, 2017   the estimated fair value was   $30.4 billion   compared to a principal value of   $28.9 billion  . The fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the publicly registered Senior Notes, which are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values and principal values consider the terms of the related debt and exclude the impacts of debt discounts and hedging activity. 
   
  9  .   Derivatives and Currency Exchange Risk Management    
  The Company uses operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk related to certain debt. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, the Company enters into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The cash flows related to all of the Company's derivative instruments are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary currencies of the derivative instruments are the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. The Company does not enter into currency exchange rate derivative contracts for speculative purposes.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding was   $11.5 billion   and   $10.8 billion   at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , respectively. 
  The following information explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by the Company, reasons the Company uses such instruments, and the impact such instruments have on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. 
  Freestanding Derivative Contracts  
  Freestanding derivative contracts are primarily used to offset the Company s exposure to the change in value of specific foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities and to offset variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The gross notional amount of the Company's currency exchange rate contracts outstanding at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017   was   $5.2 billion   and   $4.9 billion  , respectively. The Company's freestanding currency exchange rate contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign-currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows.  
  The Company also entered into total return swaps in fiscal year   2018  , which are used to hedge the liability of a non-qualified, deferred compensation plan. The gross notional amount of the Company's total return swaps outstanding at   April 27, 2018   was   $210 million  . The Company's total return swaps are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these instruments are recognized in earnings.  
  The amounts and classification of the gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of income related to derivative instruments, not designated as hedging instruments, for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016   are as follows: 

Cash Flow Hedges 
  Currency Exchange Rate Risk    
  Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of   accumulated other comprehensive loss  . The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings and is included in   other expense, net   or   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  
  No   gains or losses relating to ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges were recognized in earnings during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , or   2016  . No components of the hedge contracts were excluded in the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness, and no hedges were derecognized or discontinued during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , or   2016  . The gross notional amount of these contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, outstanding at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017   was   $6.3 billion   and   $5.8 billion  , respectively, and will mature within the subsequent   two  -year period.

Forecasted Debt Issuance Interest Rate Risk        
  Forward starting interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are designed to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt. The effective portion of the gains or losses on forward starting interest rate derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are reported as a component of   accumulated other comprehensive loss  . Beginning in the period in which the planned debt issuance occurs and the related derivative instruments are terminated, the effective portion of the gains or losses are then reclassified into   interest expense, net   over the term of the related debt. Any portion of the gains or losses that are determined to be ineffective is immediately recognized in   interest expense, net  . 
  During fiscal year   2017  , in connection with the issuance of the 2017 Senior Notes, the Company terminated   $300 million   of fixed pay, forward starting interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed rate of   3.10 percent  . During fiscal year   2016  , the Company terminated forward starting interest rate derivatives with a consolidated notional amount of   $500 million  , which were previously entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that was no longer expected. During fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , there were   $21 million   and   $23 million  , respectively, of unrealized gains recorded in   accumulated other comprehensive loss  .  
  No   gains or losses related to the ineffectiveness of forward starting interest rate derivative instruments were recognized in   interest expense, net   during fiscal years   2017   and   2016  . Additionally, during fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , no components of the forward starting interest rate derivative instruments were excluded in the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness and no hedges were derecognized or discontinued. The reclassification of the effective portion of the net losses from   accumulated other comprehensive loss   to   interest expense, net   was not significant.  
  At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , the Company had   $(207) million   and   $37 million  , respectively, in after-tax net unrealized (losses) gains associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in   accumulated other comprehensive loss  . The Company expects that   $111 million   of after-tax net unrealized losses at   April 27, 2018   will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the next 12 months. 
  Fair Value Hedges 
  Interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are designed to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.

  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in   interest expense, net  , and are offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt instrument. The gains (losses) from terminated interest rate swap agreements are recorded in   long-term debt  , increasing (decreasing) the outstanding balances of the debt, and amortized as a reduction of (addition to)   interest expense, net   over the remaining life of the related debt.  
  At both   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , the Company had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of   $1.2 billion  , designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed-rate senior note obligations, including the Company s   $500 million     4.125   percent 2011 Senior Notes due fiscal year 2021 and the   $675 million     3.125 percent   2012 Senior Notes due fiscal year 2022.  
  At   April 27, 2018  , the market value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements was an unrealized loss of   $6 million  , as compared to an unrealized gain of   $41 million   at   April 28, 2017  . At   April 27, 2018  , the market value of the hedged items was an unrealized gain of   $6 million  , as compared to an unrealized loss of   $41 million  . The amounts were recorded in   other assets   with the offsets recorded in   long-term debt   on the consolidated balance sheets.  
  No   significant hedge ineffectiveness was recognized as a result of these fair value hedges for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , or   2016  . In addition, the Company did   no  t recognize any gains or losses during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , or   2016   on firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges.

The following table provides information by level for the derivative assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The Company has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis, even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. The following table provides information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria as stipulated by the terms of the master netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. Derivatives not subject to master netting arrangements are not eligible for net presentation.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of interest-bearing investments, forward exchange derivative contracts, and trade accounts receivable. Global concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.  
  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, and certain other financial instruments (including currency exchange rate and interest rate derivative contracts) with various major financial institutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standings of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. In addition, the Company has collateral credit agreements with its primary derivatives counterparties. Under these agreements, either party is required to post eligible collateral when the market value of transactions covered by the agreement exceeds specific thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties. At   April 27, 2018  , the Company posted net securities collateral of   $76 million   to its counterparties. At   April 28, 2017  , the Company received net cash collateral of   $60 million   from its counterparties. The cash collateral received was recorded in   cash and cash equivalents  , with the offset recorded as an increase in   other accrued expenses   on the consolidated balance sheets. The security collateral posted remained in   investments   on the consolidated balance sheets.

  Inventory balances, net of reserves, were as follows:

  Property, plant, and equipment balances and corresponding estimated useful lives were as follows: 

Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense of   $821 million  ,   $937 million  , and   $889 million   was recognized in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. Upon retirement or disposal of property, plant, and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds, is recognized in earnings.

  The authorized share capital of the Company includes   127.5 million   of Preferred Shares, with a par value of   $0.20   per share. At   April 27, 2018  ,   no   Preferred Shares were issued or outstanding. 
  A Preferred Shares 
  The authorized share capital of the Company includes   500 thousand   A Preferred Shares, with a par value of   $1.00   per share. At   April 27, 2018  ,   1,872   A Preferred Shares were outstanding. The holders of A Preferred Shares are entitled to payment of dividends prior to any other class of shares in the Company equal to twice the dividend to be paid per Company ordinary share. On a return of assets, whether on liquidation or otherwise, the A Preferred Shares are entitled to repayment of the capital paid up thereon in priority to any repayment of capital to the holders of any other shares and the holders of the A Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any further participation in the assets or profits of the Company. The holders of the A Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive notice of, nor to attend, speak, or vote at any general meeting of the Company.  
  Dividends 
  The timing, declaration, and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary and A Preferred shares falls within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, the Company's earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.

Ordinary Share Repurchase Program 
  Shares are repurchased from time to time to support the Company s stock-based compensation programs and to return capital to shareholders. During fiscal years   2018   and   2017  , the Company repurchased approximately   25 million   and   43 million   shares, respectively, at an average price of   $83.71   and   $83.03  , respectively.  
  In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves, the repurchase of   80 million   of the Company's ordinary shares. As described below, this authorization was replaced in June 2017. During fiscal year 2018, prior to the June 2017 repurchase program which became effective on June 26, 2017, the Company purchased approximately   13 million   shares authorized under the June 2015 repurchase program. 
  In June 2017, the Company s Board of Directors replaced the June 2015 authorization to repurchase up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares with an authorization to expend up to an aggregate amount of   $5.0 billion   beginning June 26, 2017 to repurchase the Company s ordinary shares. At   April 27, 2018  , the Company had used approximately   $1.0 billion   of the   $5.0 billion   authorized under the repurchase program, leaving approximately   $4.0 billion   available for future repurchases. The Company accounts for repurchases of ordinary shares using the par value method and shares repurchased are canceled. 
   
  13  .   Stock Purchase and Award Plans    
  The Medtronic, Inc. 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan was originally approved by the Company's shareholders in August 2013. In January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an amendment to and assumption of the Medtronic, Inc. 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, which created the Medtronic plc 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (2013 Plan). In fiscal year   2018  , the Company granted stock awards under the 2013 Plan. The 2013 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock and cash-based awards. At   April 27, 2018  , there were approximately   63 million   shares available for future grants under the 2013 Plan. 
  Share Options     Options are granted at the exercise price, which is equal to the closing price of the Company s ordinary share on the grant date. The majority of the Company s options are non-qualified options with a   10  -year life and a   4  -year ratable vesting term. In fiscal year   2018  , the Company granted share options under the 2013 Plan. The Company also grants shares of performance-based share options that typically cliff vest after   three   years only if the Company has also achieved certain performance objectives. Performance awards are expensed over the performance period based on the probability of achieving the performance objectives.  
  Restricted Stock     Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively referred to as restricted stock) are granted to officers and key employees. At   April 27, 2018  , the Company does   no  t have any outstanding restricted stock awards. Beginning in fiscal year   2018  , restricted stock units have a   4  -year ratable vesting term. Restricted stock units issued prior to fiscal year   2018   cliff vest after   four   years. The expense recognized for restricted stock units is equal to the grant date fair value, which is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Restricted stock units are expensed over the vesting period and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. The Company also grants shares of performance-based restricted stock units that typically cliff vest after   three   years only if the Company has also achieved certain performance objectives. Performance awards are expensed over the performance period based on the probability of achieving the performance objectives.  
  Restricted stock units are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Dividend equivalent units are accumulated on restricted stock units during the vesting period. In fiscal year   2018  , the Company granted restricted stock units under the 2013 Plan. At   April 27, 2018  , all restricted stock outstanding were restricted stock units.  
  Employees Stock Purchase Plan     The Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2014 Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) allows participating employees to purchase the Company's ordinary shares at a discount through payroll deductions. The expense recognized for shares purchased under the Company s ESPP is equal to the   15 percent   discount the employee receives at the end of the calendar quarter purchase period. 
  Employees may contribute between   2   percent and   10 percent   of their wages or the statutory limit under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code toward the purchase of newly-issued ordinary shares of the Company at   85 percent   of its market value at the end of the calendar quarter purchase period. Employees purchased   2 million   shares at an average price of   $69.41   per share in fiscal year   2018  . At   April 27, 2018  , plan participants had approximately   $11 million   withheld to purchase the Company's ordinary shares at   85 percent   of its market value on June 29, 2018, the last trading day before the end of the calendar quarter purchase period. At   April 27, 2018  , approximately   16 million   ordinary shares were available for future purchase under the ESPP.

Stock Option Valuation Assumptions    The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) to determine the fair value of stock options at the grant date. The fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, volatility of the Company s stock price, and expected dividends. 
  The following table provides the weighted average fair value of options granted to employees and the related assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model: 

(1) 
    The Company analyzes historical employee stock option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption. The Company calculates the expected life assumption using the midpoint scenario, which combines historical exercise data with hypothetical exercise data, as the Company believes this data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option. 
              (2) 
    The rate is based on the grant date yield of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the option. 
              (3) 
    Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and an implied volatility of the Company s ordinary shares. Implied volatility is based on market traded options of the Company s ordinary shares. 
              (4) 
    The dividend yield rate is calculated by dividing the Company s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. 
     Stock-Based Compensation Expense     The following table presents the components and classification of stock-based compensation expense recognized for stock options, restricted stock, and ESPP in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  :

14  .   Income Taxes    
  The income tax provision is based on income before income taxes reported for financial statement purposes. The components of income before income taxes, based on tax jurisdiction, are as follows: 

The income tax provision consists of the following: 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which significantly revises U.S. corporate income taxation by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from   35.0 percent   to   21.0 percent   effective January 1, 2018, broadening the base of taxation, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted.  The decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from   35.0 percent   to   21.0 percent   results in a blended statutory tax rate of   30.5 percent   for the Company's fiscal year   2018  . As discussed in Note   1  , the Company adopted guidance related to the finalization of the accounting for the income tax impacts of the Tax Act. Until the accounting for the income tax impacts of the Tax Act is complete, the reported amounts are based on reasonable estimates and are disclosed as provisional.  
  As of   April 27, 2018  , the Company had not fully completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act. The Company s income tax provision for fiscal year   2018   is based on a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and expected reversal of existing deferred tax balances. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company has removed its permanently reinvested assertion on historical earnings through   April 27, 2018   for legal entities with accumulated earnings subject to the transition tax. The Company continues to evaluate its permanently reinvested assertion for certain legal entities. For the amounts which the Company was able to reasonably estimate, the Company recognized a provisional net tax charge of   $2.4 billion   within   income tax provision   in the consolidated statements of income. The components of the provisional tax amounts are as follows: 
             
    A provisional tax charge of   $2.6 billion   for the transition tax liability. The Company has not yet completed the calculation of the total post-1986 foreign earnings   profits (E P) and the income tax pools for all foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign E P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. In addition, further interpretations from U.S. federal and state governments and regulatory organizations may change the provisional tax liability or the accounting treatment of the provisional tax liability. 
                
    A provisional net tax benefit of   $114 million   associated with the change in the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate for the year and the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets, liabilities, and valuation allowances.

Because of the complexity of the new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax rules, the Company continues to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act. The Company is allowed to make an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred (the  period cost method ) or (2) factoring such amounts into the Company's measurement of its deferred taxes (the  deferred method ). The Company's selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing its global income to determine whether it can reasonably estimate the tax impact. The Company is currently in the process of analyzing its structure and is not yet able to determine the effect of this provision of the Tax Act. Therefore, the Company has not yet made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred tax on GILTI and has not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in its consolidated financial statements. 
  Tax assets (liabilities), shown before jurisdictional netting of deferred tax assets (liabilities), are comprised of the following:

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

No deferred taxes have been provided on the approximately   $61.0 billion   and   $31.8 billion   of undistributed earnings of the Company s subsidiaries at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , respectively, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. During fiscal year   2018  , the Company removed its permanently reinvested assertion on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries with a U.S. parent which were subject to the transition tax. The assertion was removed for all earnings of such subsidiaries through   April 27, 2018  . Due to the number of legal entities and jurisdictions involved, the complexity of the legal entity structure of the Company, and the complexity of the tax laws in the relevant jurisdictions, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate, within any reasonable range, the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon distribution of these undistributed earnings. 
  At   April 27, 2018  , the Company had approximately   $28.4 billion   of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which     $25.2 billion   have no expiration, and the remaining   $3.2 billion   will expire during fiscal years 2019 through 2038. Included in these net operating loss carryforwards are   $19.7 billion   of net operating losses related to a subsidiary of the Company, substantially all of which were recorded in fiscal 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from certain non-U.S. taxing authorities. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against these net operating losses, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized. Certain of the remaining non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of   $8.7 billion   have a valuation allowance recorded against the carryforwards, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized.    
  At   April 27, 2018  , the Company had   $963 million   of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, which will expire during fiscal years 2019 through 2036. For U.S. state purposes, the Company had   $981 million   of net operating loss carryforwards at   April 27, 2018  , which will expire during fiscal years 2019 through 2038.  
  At   April 27, 2018  , the Company also had   $174 million   of tax credits available to reduce future income taxes payable, of which     $58 million   have no expiration. The remaining credits expire during fiscal years 2019 through 2038.  
  The Company has established valuation allowances of   $7.2 billion   and   $6.3 billion   at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , respectively, primarily related to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets which are primarily comprised of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal year   2018   is primarily related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against current year generated losses, as well as the effects of currency fluctuations. These valuation allowances would result in a reduction to the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income if they are ultimately not required. 
  During fiscal year   2018  , the Company received a tax ruling confirming the treatment of various intercompany transactions, which  have the effect of utilizing the   $12.0 billion   of non-U.S. special deductions previously disclosed. The ruling allowed the Company to offset some of the gain on the sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group segment, as well as recognize an income tax benefit associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property and the associated elimination of a deferred tax liability.

The Company s effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as follows: 

(1) 
    Adjustments include the impact of restructuring charges, net, acquisition- and divestiture-related items, certain litigation charges, special charge, debt redemption premium, inventory step-up, loss on previously held forward starting interest rate swaps, interest expense, net, and certain tax adjustments, net.  
     During fiscal year   2018  , certain tax adjustments of   $1.9 billion  , recognized in   income tax provision   in the consolidated statements of income, included the following: 
             
    A net charge of   $2.4 billion   associated with U.S. tax reform, inclusive of the transition tax, remeasurement of U.S. Federal deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate. The Company s income tax provision associated with the impact of the Tax Act for fiscal year   2018   is based on a reasonable estimate and will be finalized within the measurement period.  
                
    A charge of   $73 million   associated with an internal reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries.  
                
    A net benefit of   $579 million   associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property.   
     During fiscal year   2017  , certain tax adjustments of   $202 million  , recognized in   income tax provision   in the consolidated statements of income, included the following:  
             
    A charge of   $404 million   associated with the IRS resolution for the Ardian, CoreValve, Inc., Ablation Frontiers, Inc., PEAK Surgical, Inc. and Salient Surgical Technologies, Inc. acquisition-related issues and the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for certain businesses. This resolution does not include the businesses that are the subject of the Medtronic, Inc. U.S. Tax Court case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.  
                
    A net charge of   $125 million   associated with the divestiture of a portion of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal.  The net charge primarily relates to the tax effect from the recognition of the outside basis difference of certain subsidiaries, which are included in the expected divestiture.  
                
    A charge of   $86 million   associated with the IRS s disallowance of the utilization of certain net operating losses, along with the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net operating loss deferred tax asset, which were recognized during the year.  
                
    A charge of   $18 million   as a result of the redemption of an intercompany minority interest during the year.   
                
    A benefit of   $431 million   as the result of the resolution of Covidien's previously disclosed Tyco International plc intercompany debt issues with the U.S. Tax Court and the Appeals Division of the IRS.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

During fiscal year   2016  , certain tax adjustments of   $417 million  , recognized in   income tax provision   in the consolidated statements of income, included the following: 
             
    A charge of   $442 million   primarily related to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the Company's completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy Covidien businesses that reduced the cash and investments held by its U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries (the Internal Reorganization). As a result of the Internal Reorganization, approximately   $9.7 billion   of cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities previously held by U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries became available for general corporate purposes.  
                
    A   $25 million   tax benefit associated with the disposition of a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary. 
     Currently, the Company s operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Israel have various tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by   $446 million  ,   $475 million  , and   $474 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively, and earnings per diluted share by   $0.33  ,   $0.34  , and   $0.33   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. Unless these grants are extended, they will expire between fiscal years 2019 and 2029. The Company s historical practice has been to renew, extend, or obtain new tax incentive grants upon expiration of existing tax incentive grants. If the Company is not able to renew, extend, or obtain new tax incentive grants, the expiration of existing tax incentive grants could have a material impact on the Company s financial results in future periods. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year   2018   did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  The Company had   $1.7 billion  ,   $1.9 billion  , and   $2.7 billion   of gross unrecognized tax benefits at   April 27, 2018  ,   April 28, 2017  , and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016   is as follows: 

If all of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits at   April 27, 2018  ,   April 28, 2017  , and   April 29, 2016   were recognized,   $1.7 billion  ,   $1.8 billion  , and   $2.1 billion   would impact the Company s effective tax rate, respectively. Although the Company believes that it has adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate in future periods. The Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, net of cash advance, of   $868 million   as a noncurrent liability. The Company estimates that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that its uncertain tax positions, excluding interest, could decrease by as much as   $25 million  , net as a result of the resolution of tax matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities as well as statute of limitation lapses. 
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in   income tax provision   in the consolidated statements of income and records the liability in the current or noncurrent   accrued income taxes   in the consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. The Company had   $128 million  ,   $360 million  , and   $609 million   of accrued gross interest and penalties at   April 27, 2018  ,   April 28, 2017  , and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. During fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , the Company recognized gross  
  
   96 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

interest expense (income) of approximately   $84 million  ,   $(208) million  , and   $80 million  , respectively, in   income tax provision   in the consolidated statements of income. 
  During fiscal year   2018  , the Company made a   $1.1 billion   advance payment to the IRS in connection with certain tax matters for fiscal years 2005 through 2014. This payment is comprised of   $859 million   of tax and   $285 million   of interest. 
  The Company s reserves for uncertain tax positions relate to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. These reserves are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment. Resolution of these significant unresolved matters, or positions taken by the IRS or other tax authorities during future tax audits, could have a material impact on the Company s financial results in future periods. The Company continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and that it has meritorious defenses for its tax filings and will vigorously defend them during the audit process, appellate process, and through litigation in courts, as necessary. 
  The major tax jurisdictions where the Company conducts business which remain subject to examination are as follows:   

See Note   19   for additional information regarding the status of current tax audits and proceedings. 
   
  15  .   Earnings Per Share        
  Earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, as the Company's A Preferred Shares are considered participating securities. Accordingly, earnings are allocated to both ordinary shares and participating securities in determining earnings per ordinary share. Due to the limited number of A Preferred Shares outstanding, this allocation had no effect on the ordinary earnings per share; therefore, it is not presented below. Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding, increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive ordinary shares been issued, and reduced by the number of shares the Company could have repurchased from the proceeds from issuance of the potentially dilutive ordinary shares. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares include stock-based awards granted under the stock-based compensation plans and shares committed to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.  
  
   97 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

The calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding excludes options to purchase approximately   10 million  ,   7 million  , and   4 million   ordinary shares in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive on the Company s earnings per share. 
   
  16  .   Retirement Benefit Plans    
  The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. The expense related to these plans was   $552 million  ,   $602 million  , and   $584 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. 
  In the U.S., the Company maintains a qualified pension plan designed to provide guaranteed minimum retirement benefits to all eligible U.S. employees. Pension coverage for non-U.S. employees is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. In addition to the benefits provided under the qualified pension plan, retirement benefits associated with wages in excess of the IRS allowable limits are provided to certain employees under a non-qualified plan. U.S. and Puerto Rico employees are also eligible to receive a medical benefit component, in addition to normal retirement benefits, through the Company s post-retirement benefits.  
  At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , the net underfunded status of the Company s benefit plans was   $942 million   and   $1.3 billion  , respectively. The   $1.3 billion   underfunded status at   April 28, 2017   included   $12 million   of liabilities classified as held for sale. The liabilities classified as held for sale consisted of   $9 million   related to pension benefits and   $3 million   related to post-retirement benefits. Pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities held for sale at   April 28, 2017   were divested during fiscal year   2018   as part of the sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses.  
  During fiscal year   2017  , the Company offered certain eligible U.S. employees voluntary early retirement packages. The acceptance of this offer by eligible U.S. employees caused incremental expenses of   $73 million   to be recognized during fiscal year   2017  . Of this amount,   $60 million   related to U.S. pension benefits,   $7 million   related to U.S. post-retirement benefits,   $4 million   related to defined contribution plans, and   $2 million   related to cash payments and administrative fees.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

In certain countries outside the U.S., fully funding pension plans is not a common practice, as funding provides no income tax benefit. Consequently, certain pension plans were partially funded at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  . U.S. and non-U.S. plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following: 

Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following: 

The net periodic benefit cost of the plans include the following components: 

The other changes in plan assets and projected benefit obligations recognized in   accumulated other comprehensive loss   for fiscal year   2018   are as follows:

The actuarial assumptions are as follows: 

The Company changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, effective April 30, 2016. Previously, the Company estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the market-observed yield curves of high-quality fixed income securities used to measure the pension benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The current yield curves represent high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company s pension obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The Company accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. 
  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are determined using a building block approach, considering historical averages and real returns of each asset class. In certain countries, where historical returns are not meaningful, consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns. 
  Retirement Benefit Plan Investment Strategy     The Company sponsors trusts that hold the assets for U.S. pension plans and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans, primarily retiree medical benefits. For investment purposes, the legacy Medtronic U.S. pension and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans are managed in an identical way, as their objectives are similar. 
  The Company has a Qualified Plan Committee (the Plan Committee) that sets investment guidelines for U.S. pension plans and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans with the assistance of external consultants. These guidelines are established based on market conditions, risk tolerance, funding requirements, and expected benefit payments. The Plan Committee also oversees the investment allocation process, selects the investment managers, and monitors asset performance. As pension liabilities are long-term in nature, the Company employs a long-term total return approach to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets for a prudent level of risk. An annual analysis on the risk versus the return of the investment portfolio is conducted to justify the expected long-term rate of return assumption. 
  The investment portfolios contain a diversified allocation of investment categories, including equities, fixed income securities, hedge funds, and private equity. Securities are also diversified in terms of domestic and international, short- and long-term, growth and value styles, large cap and small cap stocks, active and passive management, and derivative-based styles. 
  Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. There is significant variation in policy asset allocation from country to country. Local regulations, funding rules, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The weighted average target asset allocations at   April 27, 2018   for the plans are   38%   equity securities,   29%   debt securities, and   33%   other.

The plans did not hold any investments in the Company s ordinary shares at   April 27, 2018   or   April 28, 2017  . 
  The Company s U.S. plans target asset allocations at   April 27, 2018  , compared to the U.S. plans actual asset allocations at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017   by asset category, are as follows: 

Retirement Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values     The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for retirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value:  
  Short-term investments:   Valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded. 
  U.S. government securities:   Certain U.S. government securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded. Other U.S. government securities are valued based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable. 
  Corporate debt securities:   Valued based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable. 
  Equity commingled trusts:   Comprised of investments in equity securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of equity commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.  
  Fixed income commingled trusts:   Comprised of investments in fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of fixed income commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.  
  Partnership units:   Valued based on the year-end net asset values of the underlying partnerships. The net asset values of the partnerships are based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the partnerships. Quoted market prices are used to value the underlying investments of the partnerships, where the partnerships consist of the investment pools which invest primarily in common stocks. Partnership units include partnerships, private equity investments, and real asset investments. Partnerships primarily include long/short equity and absolute return strategies. These investments may be redeemed monthly with notice periods ranging from   45   to   95   days. At   April 27, 2018  , there are   no   funds in the process of liquidation. Private equity investments consist of common stock and debt instruments of private companies. For private equity funds, the sum of the unfunded commitments at   April 27, 2018   is   $168 million  , and the estimated liquidation period of these funds is expected to be   one   to   15 years  . Real asset investments consist of commodities, derivatives, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and illiquid real estate holdings. These investments have redemption and liquidation periods ranging from   30 days   to   10 years  . At   April 27, 2018  , there are   no   real estate investments in the process of liquidation. The Company expects to receive the proceeds over the next year. Other valuation procedures are utilized to arrive at fair value if a quoted market price is not available for a partnership investment. 
  Registered investment companies:   Valued at net asset values which are not publicly reported. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets. The underlying assets are valued at the quoted market prices of shares held by the plan at year-end in the active market on which the individual securities are traded. 
  Insurance contracts:   Comprised of investments in collective (group) insurance contracts, consisting of individual insurance policies. The policyholder is the employer and each member is the owner/beneficiary of their individual insurance policy. These policies are a part of the insurance company s general portfolio and participate in the insurer s profit-sharing policy on an excess yield basis.

The methods described above may produce fair values that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 
  There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during fiscal years   2018   or   2017  . 
  The following tables provide information by level for the retirement benefit plan assets that are measured at fair value, as defined by U.S. GAAP. See Note 1 for discussion of the fair value measurement terms of Levels 1, 2, and 3. In accordance with authoritative guidance adopted in fiscal year 2017, certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are not presented within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented for these investments are intended to permit reconciliation to the total fair value of plan assets at April 27, 2018 and April 28, 2017.

Non-U.S. Pension Benefits 

The following tables provide a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of non-U.S. pension benefit assets measured at fair value that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

Retirement Benefit Plan Funding     It is the Company s policy to fund retirement costs within the limits of allowable tax deductions. During fiscal year   2018  , the Company made discretionary contributions of approximately   $215 million   to the U.S. pension plan. Internationally, the Company contributed approximately   $90 million   for pension benefits during fiscal year   2018  . The Company anticipates that it will make contributions of   $91 million   and   $85 million   to its U.S. pension benefit plans and non-U.S. pension benefit plans, respectively, in fiscal year   2019  . Based on the guidelines under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the various guidelines which govern the plans outside the U.S., the majority of anticipated fiscal year 2019 contributions  
  
   104 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

will be discretionary. The Company believes that, along with pension assets, the returns on invested pension assets, and Company contributions, the Company will be able to meet its pension and other post-retirement obligations in the future. 
  Retiree benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are anticipated to be paid as follows: 

Post-retirement Benefit Plans   The net periodic benefit cost associated with the Company s post-retirement benefit plans was income of   $9 million   in fiscal year   2018   and expense of   $11 million   and   $12 million   in fiscal years    2017   and   2016  , respectively. The Company s projected benefit obligation for all post-retirement benefit plans was   $317 million   and   $323 million   at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , respectively. The Company s fair value of plan assets for all post-retirement benefit plans was   $303 million   and   $289 million   at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , respectively. The activity during fiscal year   2018   related to the change in projected benefit obligation was not material. The decrease of   $46 million   in the Company's projected benefit obligation during fiscal year   2017   was due to the U.S. post-retirement benefit plan being frozen, effective January 1, 2018. The activity during fiscal years   2018   and   2017   related to the change in fair value of plan assets was not material. 
  Defined Contribution Savings Plans    The Company has defined contribution savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees. The general purpose of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings. Company contributions to the plans are based on employee contributions and Company performance. Expense recognized under these plans was   $374 million  ,   $347 million  , and   $269 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. 
  Effective May 1, 2005, the Company froze participation in the original defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. and implemented   two   new plans: an additional defined benefit pension plan, the Personal Pension Account (PPA), and a new defined contribution plan, the Personal Investment Account (PIA). Employees in the U.S. hired on or after May 1, 2005 but before January 1, 2016 had the option to participate in either the PPA or the PIA. Participants in the PPA receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus on which they will receive an annual guaranteed rate of return, which is based on the   ten  -year Treasury bond rate. Participants in the PIA also receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus; however, they are allowed to determine how to invest their funds among identified fund alternatives. The cost associated with the PPA is included in U.S. Pension Benefits in the tables presented earlier. The defined contribution cost associated with the PIA was approximately   $56 million  ,   $58 million  , and   $58 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company froze participation in the existing defined benefit (PPA) and contribution (PIA) pension plans in the U.S. and implemented a new form of benefit under the existing defined contribution plan for legacy Covidien employees and employees in the U.S. hired on or after January 1, 2016. Participants in the Medtronic Core Contribution (MCC) also receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus and are allowed to determine how to invest their funds among identified fund alternatives. The defined contribution cost associated with the MCC was approximately $  49 million  ,   $45 million  , and   $12 million   and in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively. 
   
  17  .   Leases    
  The Company leases office, manufacturing, and research facilities and warehouses, as well as transportation, data processing, and other equipment under capital and operating leases. A substantial number of these leases contain options that allow the Company to renew at the fair rental value on the date of renewal.

Future minimum payments under capitalized leases and non-cancelable operating leases at   April 27, 2018   are: 

Rent expense for all operating leases was   $319 million  ,   $294 million  , and   $269 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , respectively.

  The income tax on gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016   was an expense of   $26 million  , an expense of   $41 million  , and a benefit of   $94 million  , respectively. During fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of   $4 million   fiscal year   2018   and   $8 million   in fiscal years   2017   and   2016  . When realized, gains and losses on available-for-sale securities reclassified from AOCI are recognized within   other expense, net  . Refer to Note   6   for additional information. 
  During fiscal year   2018  , there was no tax impact on cumulative translation adjustments. However, due to recently enacted U.S. Tax Reform and change in permanently reinvested assertion with respect to certain earnings, the Company continues to evaluate the tax impact these events may have on cumulative translation adjustments. During fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , taxes were not provided on cumulative translation adjustments as substantially all translation adjustments relate to earnings that were intended to be definitely reinvested outside the U.S.

The net change in retirement obligations in other comprehensive income includes net amortization of prior service costs and actuarial losses included in net periodic benefit cost. The income tax on the net change in retirement obligations in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016   was an expense of   $14 million  , an expense of   $41 million  , and a benefit of   $85 million  , respectively. During fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , the gains and losses on defined benefit and pension items reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of   $27 million  ,   $23 million  , and   $39 million  , respectively. Refer to Note   16   for additional information. 
  The income tax on unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016   was a benefit of   $132 million  , an expense of   $130 million  , and a benefit of   $51 million  , respectively. During fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  , gains and losses on derivative financial instruments reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of   $22 million  ,   $61 million  , and   $121 million  , respectively. When realized, cash flow hedge gains and losses reclassified from AOCI are recognized within   other expense, net   or   cost of products sold,   and forward starting interest rate derivative financial instrument gains and losses reclassified from AOCI are recognized within   interest expense, net  .

  19  .   Commitments and Contingencies    
  Legal Matters 
  The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, income tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations, including those described below. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. As a result, interaction with governmental agencies is ongoing. The Company's standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.  
  The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. At   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  , accrued litigation was approximately   $0.9 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in   other accrued expenses   and   other liabilities   on the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 
  Product Liability Matters 
  Sprint Fidelis 
  In 2007, a putative class action was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly related to the Company's Sprint Fidelis family of defibrillation leads. On October 20, 2009, the court certified a class proceeding but denied class certification on plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages. Pretrial proceedings are underway. The Company has recognized an expense for probable and estimable damages related to this matter, and accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.

INFUSE Litigation 
  The Company estimated law firms representing approximately   6,000   claimants asserted or intended to assert personal injury claims against Medtronic in the U.S. state and federal courts involving the INFUSE bone graft product. As of June 1, 2017, the Company had reached agreements to settle substantially all of these claims, resolving this litigation. The Company's accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued litigation as discussed above. 
  Pelvic Mesh Litigation 
  The Company is currently involved in litigation in various state and federal courts against manufacturers of pelvic mesh products alleging personal injuries resulting from the implantation of those products.   Two   subsidiaries of Covidien supplied pelvic mesh products to   one   of the manufacturers, C.R. Bard (Bard), named in the litigation. The litigation includes a federal multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia and cases in various state courts and jurisdictions outside the U.S. Generally, complaints allege design and manufacturing claims, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraud, violations of state consumer protection laws and loss of consortium claims. In fiscal year 2016, Bard paid the Company   $121 million   towards the settlement of   11,000   of these claims. In May 2017, the agreement with Bard was amended to extend the terms to apply to up to an additional   5,000   claims. That agreement does not resolve the dispute between the Company and Bard with respect to claims that do not settle, if any. As part of the agreement, the Company and Bard agreed to dismiss without prejudice their pending litigation with respect to Bard s obligation to defend and indemnify the Company. The Company estimates law firms representing approximately   15,800   claimants have asserted or may assert claims involving products manufactured by Covidien s subsidiaries. As of June 1, 2018, the Company had reached agreements to settle approximately   14,400   of these claims. The Company's accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued litigation as discussed above. 
  Patent Litigation 
  Ethicon 
  On December 14, 2011, Ethicon filed an action against Covidien in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging patent infringement and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On January 22, 2014, the district court entered summary judgment in Covidien's favor, and the majority of this ruling was affirmed by the Federal Circuit on August 7, 2015.  Following appeal, the case was remanded back to the District Court with respect to   one   patent. On January 21, 2016, Covidien filed a second action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, seeking a declaration of non-infringement with respect to a second set of patents held by Ethicon. The court consolidated this second action with the remaining patent issues from the first action. Following consolidation of the cases, Ethicon dismissed   six   of the asserted patents, leaving a single asserted patent. In addition to claims of non-infringement, the Company asserts an affirmative defense of invalidity. The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with this matter because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter.  
  Shareholder Related Matters 
  INFUSE 
  West Virginia Pipe Trades and Phil Pace, on June 27, 2013 and July 3, 2013, respectively, filed putative class action complaints against Medtronic, Inc. and certain of its officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleging that the defendants made false and misleading public statements and engaged in a scheme to defraud regarding the INFUSE Bone Graft product during the period of December 8, 2010 through August 3, 2011. The matters were consolidated in September, 2013, and in the consolidated complaint plaintiffs alleged a class period of September 28, 2010 through August 3, 2011. On September 30, 2015, the District Court granted defendants  motion for summary judgment in the consolidated matters. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and in December of 2016 the Eighth Circuit Court reversed and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. On January 30, 2018, the District Court issued an order certifying a class for the period of September 8, 2010 through June 28, 2011. 
  COVIDIEN ACQUISITION 
  On July 2, 2014, Lewis Merenstein filed a putative shareholder class action in Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court seeking to enjoin the then-potential acquisition of Covidien. The lawsuit named Medtronic, Inc., Covidien, and each member of the Medtronic, Inc. Board of Directors at the time as defendants, and alleged that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders with regard to the then-potential acquisition. On August 21, 2014, Kenneth Steiner filed a putative shareholder class action in Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court, also seeking an injunction to prevent the potential Covidien acquisition. In

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

September 2014, the   Merenstein   and   Steiner   matters were consolidated and in December 2014, the plaintiffs filed a preliminary injunction motion seeking to enjoin the Covidien transaction. On December 30, 2014, a hearing was held on plaintiffs  motion for preliminary injunction and on defendants  motion to dismiss. On January 2, 2015, the District Court denied the plaintiffs  motion for preliminary injunction and on January 5, 2015 issued its opinion. On March 20, 2015, the District Court issued its order and opinion granting Medtronic s motion to dismiss the case. In May of 2015, the plaintiffs filed an appeal, and, in January of 2016, the Minnesota State Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In February of 2016, the Company petitioned the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the decision of the Minnesota State Court of Appeals, and on April 19, 2016 the Minnesota Supreme Court granted the Company s petition on the issue of whether most of the original claims are properly characterized as direct or derivative under Minnesota law. In August of 2017, the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Minnesota State Court of Appeals, sending the matter back to the trial court for further proceedings. The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with this matter, because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters. 
  HEARTWARE 
  On January 22, 2016, the St. Paul Teachers  Retirement Fund Association filed a putative class action complaint (the  Complaint ) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against HeartWare on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of HeartWare from June 10, 2014 through January 11, 2016 (the  Class Period ). The Complaint was amended on June 29, 2016 and claims HeartWare and one of its executives violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making false and misleading statements about, among other things, HeartWare s response to a June 2014 U.S. FDA warning letter, the development of the Miniaturized Ventricular Assist Device (MVAD) System and the proposed acquisition of Valtech Cardio Ltd. The Complaint seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers or acquirers of HeartWare s stock during the Class Period. In August of 2016 the Company acquired HeartWare. The Company's accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued litigation as discussed above. 
  Environmental Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. 
  The Company is a successor to a company which owned and operated a chemical manufacturing facility in Orrington, Maine from 1967 until 1982, and is responsible for the costs of completing an environmental site investigation as required by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP). MDEP served a compliance order on Mallinckrodt LLC and U.S. Surgical Corporation, subsidiaries of Covidien, in December 2008, which included a directive to remove a significant volume of soils at the site. After a hearing on the compliance order before the Maine Board of Environmental Protection (Maine Board) to challenge the terms of the compliance order, the Maine Board modified the MDEP order and issued a final order requiring removal of   two   landfills, capping of the remaining   three   landfills, installation of a groundwater extraction system and long-term monitoring of the site and the   three   remaining landfills. 
  The Company has proceeded with implementation of the investigation and remediation at the site in accordance with the MDEP order as modified by the Maine Board order. 
  The Company has also been involved in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Maine People s Alliance. Plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring Covidien to conduct extensive studies of mercury contamination of the Penobscot River and Bay and options for remediating such contamination, and to perform appropriate remedial activities, if necessary. 
  On July 29, 2002, following a March 2002 trial, the District Court entered an opinion and order which held that conditions in the Penobscot River and Bay may pose an imminent and substantial endangerment and that Covidien was liable for the cost of performing a study of the river and bay. The District Court subsequently appointed an independent study panel to oversee the study and ordered Covidien to pay costs associated with the study. A report issued by the study panel contains recommendations for a variety of potential remedial options which could be implemented individually or in a variety of combinations, and included preliminary cost estimates for a variety of potential remedial options, which the report describes as  very rough estimates of cost,  ranging from   $25 million   to   $235 million  . The report indicates that these costs are subject to uncertainties, and that before any remedial option is implemented, further engineering studies and engineering design work are necessary to determine the feasibility of the proposed remedial options. In June of 2014, a trial was held to determine if remediation was necessary and feasible, and on

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

September 2, 2015, the District Court issued an order concluding that further engineering study and engineering design work is appropriate to determine the nature and extent of remediation in the Penobscot River and Bay. In January of 2016, the Court appointed an engineering firm to conduct the next phase of the study. The study is targeted for completion in calendar year 2018. 
  The Company's accrued expenses for environmental proceedings are included within accrued litigation as discussed above. 
  Government Matters 
  Since 2011, the Company has responded to requests from the U.S. Department of Justice for information about business practices relating to several neurovascular products. The requests seek information dating back to 2010, in connection with neurovascular products developed and first marketed by Covidien or one of its predecessors, including ev3. The Company has fully cooperated and continues to cooperate with the requests, which are at various stages. The Company s accrued expenses for the matters are included within accrued litigation as discussed above. 
  Since 2014, the Company has responded to requests from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Justice for information about business practices relating to several peripheral vascular products. The requests seek information dating back to 2009, in connection with peripheral vascular products developed and first marketed by Covidien or one of its predecessors, including ev3. The Company has fully cooperated and continues to cooperate with the requests, which are at various stages. The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with this matter because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter. 
  Income Taxes   
  In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The U.S. Tax Court reviewed this dispute, and on June 9, 2016, issued its opinion with respect to the allocation of income between the parties for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The U.S. Tax Court generally rejected the IRS s position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. On April 21, 2017, the IRS filed their Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals (the Court) for the 8th Circuit regarding the Tax Court Opinion. Oral argument for the Appeal occurred on March 14, 2018.  
  In October 2011, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company finalized its agreement with the IRS on the proposed adjustments associated with the tax effects of the Company's acquisition of Kyphon Inc. (Kyphon). The settlement was consistent with the certain tax adjustment recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, an expected settlement was reached with the IRS for all outstanding issues for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 except for the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. 
  In April 2014, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, an expected settlement was reached with the IRS for all outstanding issues for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 except for the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. 
  In May 2017, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The significant issues that remain unresolved relate to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, and proposed adjustments associated with the utilization of certain net operating losses. The Company disagrees with the IRS and will attempt to resolve these matters at the IRS Appellate level. 
  Medtronic, Inc. s fiscal years 2015 and 2016 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS. 
  Covidien and the IRS have concluded and reached agreement on its audit of Covidien s U.S. federal income tax returns for all tax years through 2012. The statute of limitations for Covidien s 2013 U.S. federal income tax returns lapsed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Covidien s fiscal year 2015 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS.

While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the income tax matters discussed above, the Company believes it is possible that charges associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 
  See Note   14   for additional discussion of income taxes. 
  Guarantees 
  As a result of the acquisition of Covidien, the Company has a guarantee commitment related to certain contingent tax liabilities as a party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that was entered into on June 29, 2007, between Covidien, Tyco International (now Johnson Controls), and Tyco Electronics (now TE Connectivity), associated with the spin-off from Tyco. The Tax Sharing Agreement covers certain income tax liabilities for periods prior to and including the spin-off. Medtronic s share of the income tax liabilities for these periods is   42   percent, with Johnson Controls and TE Connectivity share being   27   percent and   31   percent, respectively. If Johnson Controls and TE Connectivity default on their obligations to the Company under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these tax liabilities are being shared equally among the parties. The most significant amounts at risk under this Tax Sharing Agreement were resolved with the U.S. Tax Court and IRS Appeals resolutions reached in May 2016. However, the Tax Sharing Agreement remains in place with respect to income tax liabilities that are not the subject of such resolution, including certain state and international tax matters that remain open. 
  The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to periods prior to the 2007 separation, including amounts subject to or impacted by the provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement. The actual amounts that the Company may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement, however, could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters. Final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods, primarily related to tax years that remain open for examination. These balances will also be impacted by the filing of final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien and/or Tyco Electronics legal entities for periods prior to the 2007 separation. 
  As part of the Company s Minimally Invasive Therapies Group sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal on July 29, 2017, the Company has indemnified Cardinal for certain contingent tax liabilities related to the divested businesses that existed prior to the date of divestiture. The actual amounts that the Company may be required to ultimately accrue or pay could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters. 
  In the normal course of business, the Company and/or its affiliates periodically enter into agreements that require one or more of the Company and/or its affiliates to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of the Company or its affiliates  products, the negligence of the Company's personnel, or claims alleging that the Company's products infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property. The Company also offers warranties on various products. The Company s maximum exposure under these guarantees is unable to be estimated. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of guarantees. 
  The Company believes the ultimate resolution of the above guarantees is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position, or cash flows.

  The Company s organizational structure is based upon   four   principal operating and reportable segments: the Cardiac and Vascular Group, the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, the Restorative Therapies Group, and the Diabetes Group. The Company's management has chosen to organize the entity based upon therapy solutions. The   four   principal segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately, as each one develops and manufactures products and provides services oriented toward targeted therapy solutions.  
  The primary products and services from which the Cardiac and Vascular Group segment derives its revenues include products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiac rhythm disorders and cardiovascular disease, as well as services to diagnose, treat, and manage heart- and vascular-related disorders and diseases.  
  The primary products and services from which the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group segment derives its revenues include those focused on diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, renal system, lungs, pelvic region, kidneys, obesity, and other preventable complications.

Segment disclosures are on a performance basis, consistent with internal management reporting. Net sales of the Company's segments include end-customer revenues from the sale of products the segment develops, manufactures, and distributes. There are certain corporate and centralized expenses that are not allocated to the segments. The Company's management evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources based on net sales and segment earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization ("Segment EBITA"). Segment EBITA represents income before income taxes, excluding interest expense, net, amortization of intangible assets, centralized distribution costs, certain corporate charges, and other items not allocated to the segments.  
  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note   1  . Certain depreciable assets may be recorded by one segment, while the depreciation expense is allocated to another segment. The allocation of depreciation expense is based on the proportion of the assets used by each segment.  
  The following tables present reconciliations of financial information from the segments to the applicable line items in the Company's consolidated financial statements:

  The following presents the Company s consolidating statements of comprehensive income and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows as of and for the fiscal years ended   April 27, 2018  ,   April 28, 2017  , and   April 29, 2016  , and condensed consolidating balance sheets at   April 27, 2018   and   April 28, 2017  . The guarantees provided by the parent company guarantor and subsidiary guarantors are joint and several. Condensed consolidating financial information for Medtronic plc, Medtronic Luxco, Medtronic, Inc., CIFSA, and CIFSA Subsidiary Guarantors, on a stand-alone basis, is presented using the equity method of accounting for subsidiaries. The Company has presented the provisional tax impacts related to the Tax Act within the condensed consolidating financial statements for the fiscal year ended   April 27, 2018  , at the subsidiary which the Company reasonably expects to be affected by the Tax Act. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. 
    
  The Company made revisions to its condensed consolidating balance sheets of the guarantees of the Medtronic Senior Notes, Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes and the CIFSA Senior Notes, as previously presented in Note 23 in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 28, 2017. An approximate   $16.0 billion   revision was made to decrease the investment in subsidiaries and shareholders' equity balances in the Medtronic, Inc. column for the Medtronic Senior Notes and Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes, as well as an approximate   $16.0 billion   revision to increase the investment in subsidiaries and shareholders' equity balances in the CIFSA column for the CIFSA Senior Notes. Both revisions were primarily related to an incorrect presentation of an intercompany asset sale. There is no impact to the consolidated financial statements of Medtronic plc. 
    
  During fiscal year 2018, the Company undertook certain steps to reorganize ownership of various subsidiaries. The transactions were entirely among subsidiaries under the common control of Medtronic. The reorganization has been reflected as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.

Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective at   April 27, 2018  . Our internal control over financial reporting at   April 27, 2018  , has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who has also audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report in the section entitled  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,  which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting at   April 27, 2018  , which is included in  Item 8.

Although no specific implementation activity or related changes in internal controls occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the system deployments will continue in the coming year with a projected completion in fiscal year 2020. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

  NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT  
  AMENDED AND RESTATED 2013 STOCK AWARD AND INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
           1. 
    The Option  . Medtronic plc, an Irish public limited company (the  Company ), hereby grants to you, the individual named above, as of the above Grant Date, an option (the  Option ) to purchase the above number of ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Common Stock ), for the above Option Price Per Share, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (this  Agreement ) and in the Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the  Plan ). In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. 
       
           2. 
    Exercise of Option  . The exercise of the Option is subject to the following conditions and restrictions: 
       
           a. 
    Expiration  . Upon vesting of a portion of the Option, such portion may be exercised in whole or in part until the earlier of (i) the above Expiration Date, or (ii) the expiration of the applicable period following your Termination of Employment, as provided in Sections 2(c), (d) or (e) below. 
       
           b. 
    Schedule of Exercisability  . The Option shall become vested and exercisable to the extent of 25% of the above number of shares of Common Stock on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Grant Date. Once a portion of the Option has become exercisable, that portion may be exercised at any time thereafter, subject to the provisions of Section 2(a) above. 
       
           c. 
    Death  . Notwithstanding the schedule of exercisability set forth in Section 2(b) above, the Option shall become immediately exercisable in full upon your death, and may be exercised by your Successor (as defined below) at any time, or from time to time, within five years after the date of your death, subject to Section 2(g) below. For purposes of this Agreement, the term  Successor  shall mean the legal representative of your estate or the person or persons who may, by bequest, inheritance or valid beneficiary designation (as provided in Section 15.7 of the Plan), acquire the right to exercise the Option 
       
           d. 
    Disability or Retirement  . Notwithstanding the schedule of exercisability set forth in Section 2(b) above, the Option shall become immediately exercisable in full upon your Disability or Retirement (as each such term is defined below), and you may exercise your Option at any time, or from time to time, within five years after the date of Retirement or determination of Disability, subject to Section 2(g) below. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms  Disability  and  Retirement  shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms under any retirement plan of the Company which is qualified under Section 401 of the Code (which currently provides for retirement on or after age 55, provided you have been employed by the Company and/or one or more Affiliates for at least ten years, or retirement on or after age 62), or under any disability or retirement plan of the Company or any Affiliate applicable to you due to employment by a non-U.S. Affiliate or employment in a non-U.S. location, or as otherwise determined by the Committee. 
       
           e. 
    Termination for Any Other Reason  . In the event you incur a Termination of Employment for any reason other than those specified in Sections 2(c) and 2(d), any unvested portion of the Option will terminate as of 11:00 p.m. CT (midnight ET) on the date of your Termination of Employment. You may exercise that portion of the Option that was vested but unexercised as of the date of your Termination of Employment for ninety (90) days following the date of your Termination of Employment, subject to Section 2(g) below. At 11:00 p.m. CT (midnight ET) on the date that is 90 days after the date of your Termination of Employment, the Option will expire. 

f. 
    Change of Control  . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Option shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.1 of the Plan. 
       
           g. 
    Expiration of Term  . Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs (a) (f), in no event shall the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date. 
       
           3. 
    Manner of Exercise  . To exercise your Option, you must deliver notice of exercise (the  Notice ) to the administrator (the  Administrator ) designated by the Company to provide services relating to the administration of the Plan at the time of your exercise. The Notice must be given in the manner specified by the Administrator and must specify the number of shares of Common Stock (the  Shares ) as to which the Option is being exercised and must be accompanied by payment of the purchase price for the Shares. Payment of the purchase price may be in cash or by check. To the extent permissible under applicable law, payment of the purchase price may also be made by instructing the Company to withhold a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value (based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the applicable Option is exercised) equal to the product of (i) the exercise price multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares in respect of which the Option shall have been exercised. 
     Exercise shall be deemed to occur on the earlier of (i) the date the Notice and the purchase price for the Shares as to which the Option is being exercised are received by the Administrator and (ii) the date you simultaneously exercise the Option and sell the Shares, using the proceeds from such sale to pay the purchase price. 
           4. 
    Withhold Taxes  . You are responsible for payment of any federal, state, local or other taxes which must be withheld upon the exercise of the Option, and you must promptly pay to the Company any such taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries are authorized to deduct from any payment owed to you any taxes required to be withheld with respect to the Shares, including social security and Medicare (FICA) taxes and federal, state and local income tax with respect to income arising from the exercise of the Option. The Company shall have the right to require the payment of any such taxes before issuing any Shares pursuant to an exercise of the Option. In lieu of all or any part of a cash payment, to the extent permissible under applicable law, you may elect to have a portion of the Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Option withheld by the Company to satisfy all or part of the withholding tax requirements relating to the Option exercise with such Shares valued in the same manner as used in computing such withholding taxes. Any fractional Share amount due relating to such tax withholding will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share and the additional amount will be added to your federal withholding. 
       
           5. 
    Forfeitures  . If you have received or been entitled to receive payment in cash, delivery of Common Stock or a combination thereof pursuant to this Agreement within the period beginning six months prior to the date of your Termination of Employment and ending twelve months following the date of your Termination of Employment, the Company, in its sole discretion, may require you to return or forfeit the cash and/or Common Stock received or receivable with respect to this Option (or its economic value as of the date of the exercise of the Option), in the event that you engage in any of the following activities: 
              a. 
    performing services for or on behalf of any competitor of, or competing with, the Company or any Affiliate, within six months of the date of your Termination of Employment; 
              b. 
    unauthorized disclosure of material proprietary information of the Company or any Affiliate; 
              c. 
    a violation of applicable business ethics policies or business policies of the Company or any Affiliate; or 
              d. 
    any other occurrence determined by the Committee. 
     The Company s right to require forfeiture must be exercised not later than 90 days after the Company acquires actual knowledge of such an activity, but in no event later than twelve months after your Termination of Employment. Such right shall be deemed to be exercised upon the Company s mailing written notice of such exercise to your most recent home address as shown on the personnel records of the Company. In addition to requiring forfeiture as described herein, the Company may exercise its rights under this Section 5 by preventing or terminating the exercise of any rights under this Option or the acquisition of Shares or cash thereunder. 
  If you fail or refuse to forfeit the cash and/or Shares demanded by the Company (the number of such shares of Common Stock as may be adjusted for any events described in Section 3.4 of the Plan), you shall be liable to the Company for damages equal to the number of Shares demanded times the highest closing price per share of the Common Stock during the period between the date of your Termination of Employment and the date of any judgment or award to the Company, together with all costs and attorneys  fees incurred by the Company to enforce this provision. 

For purposes of this Section 5, forfeiture of Common Stock shall be effected by the redemption of such Common Stock in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and to the extent permissible under applicable law. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5 shall have no application following a Change of Control, nor shall the Company s Incentive Compensation Forfeiture Policy apply following a Change of Control to this Option or to any proceeds in respect of this Option. 
           6. 
    Conversion to Stock Settled Appreciation Rights  . At any time following the Grant Date, the Company may convert this Option to a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right. Upon exercise of a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right, you shall receive shares of Common Stock with a value equal to the excess of (1) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of exercise over (2) the Option Price Per Share multiplied by the number of Shares. 
       
           7. 
    Governing Law, Venue and Personal Jurisdiction  .  Notwithstanding anything contrary in the Plan, the validity, enforceability, construction and interpretation of the Plan or Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota.  You irrevocably waive any right to have the laws of any state or nation or other legal jurisdiction other than the State of Minnesota apply to the Plan or Agreement. Any dispute regarding the Plan or Agreement shall be exclusively decided by a state court in the State of Minnesota, and you irrevocably waive any right to have any such disputes decided in any jurisdiction or venue other than a state court in the State of Minnesota.      You irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state courts in the State of Minnesota for the purposes of any action arising out of or related to the Plan or Agreement, and irrevocably waive any right to remove any case commenced by Medtronic from a state court in the State of Minnesota to any federal court. 
       
           8. 
    Agreement  . Your receipt of the Option and this Agreement constitutes your agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan.

  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
  AMENDED AND RESTATED 2013 STOCK AWARD AND INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
           1. 
    Restricted Stock Units Award  . Medtronic plc, an Irish public limited company (the  Company ), hereby awards to the individual named above Restricted Stock Units, in the number and on the Grant Date as each is set forth above. The Restricted Stock Units represent the right to receive ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Shares ), subject to the restrictions, limitations, and conditions contained in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the  Agreement ) and in the Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the  Plan ). Unless otherwise defined in the Agreement, a capitalized term in the Agreement will have the same meaning as in the Plan. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan will govern. 
       
           2. 
    Vesting   Distribution  . The Restricted Stock Units will vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Grant Date. The Company will issue to you a number of Shares equal to the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) within six weeks following each applicable vesting date, provided that you have not incurred a Termination of Employment prior to such vesting date (the  Restricted Period ). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if you incur a Termination of Employment during the Restricted Period as a result of your death, Disability or Retirement, you will vest in the next tranche of your Restricted Stock Units on a pro rata basis (based on the length of time you were employed during the applicable portion of the Restricted Period), and the Company will issue you a number of Shares equal to the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) within six weeks following your separation from service. Any portion of the Restricted Stock Units that does not vest in accordance with the foregoing will automatically be forfeited and canceled by the Company as of 11:00 p.m. CT (midnight ET) on the date of such Termination of Employment.  Upon your Termination of Employment during the Restricted Period for any reason other than death, Disability or Retirement, the Restricted Stock Units will automatically be forfeited in full and canceled by the Company as of 11:00 p.m. CT (midnight ET) on the date of such Termination of Employment. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms  Disability  and  Retirement  shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms, as of the date of this Agreement, under any retirement plan of the Company which is qualified under Section 401 of the Code (which currently provides for retirement on or after age 55, provided you have been employed by the Company and/or one or more Affiliates for at least ten years, or retirement on or after age 62), or under any disability or retirement plan of the Company or any Affiliate applicable to you due to employment by a non U.S. Affiliate or employment in a non U.S. location.  
       
           3. 
    Forfeiture  . If you have received or are entitled to receive delivery of Shares as a result of this Agreement within the period beginning six months prior to the date of your Termination of Employment and ending twelve months following the date of your Termination of Employment, the Company, in its sole discretion, may require you to return or forfeit the cash and/or Shares received or receivable with respect to this Restricted Stock Units award, in the event that you engage in any of the following activities: 
       
           a. 
    performing services for or on behalf of any competitor of, or competing with, the Company or any Affiliate, within six months of the date of your Termination of Employment; 
       
           b. 
    unauthorized disclosure of material proprietary information of the Company or any Affiliate; 
       
           c. 
    a violation of applicable business ethics policies or business policies of the Company or any Affiliate; or 
       
           d. 
    any other occurrence determined by the Committee. 
     The Company s right to require forfeiture must be exercised not later than 90 days after the Company acquires actual knowledge of such an activity but in no event later than twelve months after your Termination of Employment. Such right shall be deemed to be exercised upon the Company s mailing written notice of such exercise to your most recent  

home address as shown on the personnel records of the Company. In addition to requiring forfeiture as described herein, the Company may exercise its rights under this Section 3 by terminating the Restricted Stock Units awarded under this Agreement. 
  If you fail or refuse to forfeit the cash and/or shares of Common Stock demanded by the Company (the number of such shares of Common Stock as may be adjusted for any events described in Section 3.4 of the Plan), you shall be liable to the Company for damages equal to the number of Shares demanded times the highest closing price per share of the Common Stock during the period between the date of your Termination of Employment and the date of any judgment or award to the Company, together with all costs and attorneys  fees incurred by the Company to enforce this provision. 
  For purposes of this Section 3, forfeiture of Common Stock shall be effected by the redemption of such Common Stock in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and to the extent permissible under applicable law. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 3 shall have no application following a Change of Control, nor shall the Company s Incentive Compensation Forfeiture Policy apply following a Change of Control to the Restricted Stock Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement or to any proceeds in respect of such award. 
           4. 
    Change of Control  . Notwithstanding anything in Section 2 of this Agreement to the contrary, if a Change of Control of the Company occurs during the Restricted Period, then the Restricted Stock Units will become 100% vested upon such Change of Control, and the Company will issue to you a number of Shares equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) within six weeks following the Change of Control, provided that no such vesting or issuance shall occur if the Restricted Stock Units are replaced or continued by a Replacement Award that satisfies the requirements of Section 10.1(b) of the Plan. In the event that the Restricted Stock Units are replaced by a Replacement Award and you incur a Termination of Employment during the two years following a Change of Control by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason, such Replacement Award shall vest in full and be settled within six weeks following your Termination of Employment.  
       
           5. 
    Dividend Equivalents  . You are entitled to receive dividend equivalents on the Restricted Stock Units generally in the same manner and at the same time as if each Restricted Stock Unit were a Share. These dividend equivalents will be credited to you in the form of additional Restricted Stock Units. The additional Restricted Stock Units will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. 
       
           6. 
    Withhold Taxes  . You are responsible to promptly pay any Social Security and Medicare taxes (together,  FICA ) due upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, and any Federal, State, and local taxes due upon distribution of the Shares. The Company and its Subsidiaries are authorized to deduct from any payment to you any such taxes required to be withheld. As described in Section 15.4 of the Plan and to the extent permissible under applicable law, you may elect to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units to satisfy all or part of the withholding tax requirements. You may also elect, at the time you vest in the Restricted Stock Units, to pay your FICA liability due with respect to those Restricted Stock Units out of those units. If you choose to do so, the Company will reduce the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units accordingly. The amount that is applied to pay FICA will be subject to Federal, State, and local taxes. 
       
           7. 
    Limitation of Rights  . Except as set forth in the Agreement, until the Shares are issued to you in settlement of your Restricted Stock Units, you do not have any right in, or with respect to, any Shares (including any voting rights) by reason of this Agreement. Further, you may not transfer or assign your rights under the Agreement and you do not have any rights in the Company s assets that are superior to a general, unsecured creditor of the Company by reason of this Agreement. 
       
           8. 
    No Employment Contract  . Nothing contained in the Plan or Agreement creates any right to your continued employment or otherwise affects your status as an employee at will. You hereby acknowledge that the Company and you each have the right to terminate your employment at any time for any reason or for no reason at all. 
       
           9. 
    Amendment to Agreement Under Section 409A of the Code  . You acknowledge that the Agreement and the Plan are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and that changes may need to be made to the Agreement to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. You agree that following the issuance of such rules, the Company may amend this Agreement as it deems necessary or desirable to avoid such adverse tax consequences;  

provided, however, that the Company shall accomplish such amendments in a manner that preserves your intended benefits under the Agreement to the greatest extent possible. 
    
           10. 
    Governing Law, Venue and Personal Jurisdiction  .  Notwithstanding anything contrary in the Plan, the validity, enforceability, construction and interpretation of the Plan or Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota.  You irrevocably waive any right to have the laws of any state or nation or other legal jurisdiction other than the State of Minnesota apply to the Plan or Agreement. Any dispute regarding the Plan or Agreement shall be exclusively decided by a state court in the State of Minnesota, and you irrevocably waive any right to have any such disputes decided in any jurisdiction or venue other than a state court in the State of Minnesota.      You irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state courts in the State of Minnesota for the purposes of any action arising out of or related to the Plan or Agreement, and irrevocably waive any right to remove any case commenced by Medtronic from a state court in the State of Minnesota to any federal court. 
       
           11. 
    Agreement  . You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. Your signature is not required in order to make this Agreement effective. You are deemed to consent to the application of all of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan unless you contact HROC-Stock Administration at the address set forth below in writing within thirty (30) days of receiving the grant package. Receipt by the Company of your non-consent will nullify this award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by you and the Company.

The Company will issue to you a number of Shares equal to the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) within six weeks following any vesting date, provided that you have not incurred a Termination of Employment during the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the vesting date (the  Restricted Period ).  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if you incur a Termination of Employment during the Restricted Period as a result of your death, Disability or Retirement, and all other conditions and restrictions are met during the Restricted Period, all restrictions on such Restricted Stock Units shall lapse 100% on the third anniversary of the grant date if the Company s cumulative diluted earnings per share growth during the 36 month period ending on the last day of the Company s fiscal year immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Grant Date equals or exceeds a 3% compound annual growth rate, as determined by the Compensation Committee, and the Company will issue you a number of Shares equal to the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units     (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) on the third anniversary of the Grant Date.  Upon your Termination of Employment during the Restricted Period for any reason other than death, Disability or Retirement, the Restricted Stock Units will automatically be forfeited in full and canceled by the Company as of 11:00 p.m. CT (midnight ET) on the date of such Termination of Employment.  For purposes of this Agreement, the terms  Disability  and  Retirement  shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms, as of the date of this Agreement, under any retirement plan of the Company which is qualified under Section 401 of the Code (which currently provides for retirement on or after age 55, provided you have been employed by the Company and/or one or more Affiliates for at least ten years, or retirement on or after age 62), or under any disability or retirement plan of the Company or any Affiliate applicable to you due to employment by a non-U.S. Affiliate or employment in a non-U.S. location.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you incur a Termination of Employment during the Restricted Period as a result of your death, Disability, or Retirement, no Shares shall be delivered to you pursuant to this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the date on which you incur a  separation from service  (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), or, if you are a  specified employee  (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) at the time of such  separation from service,  on the date that is six months following the date of your  separation from service  (ii) the originally scheduled vesting date for the applicable Restricted Stock Units; (iii) the date of your death; and (iv) the date on which you become  disabled  (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code). 
       
           3. 
    Forfeiture  . If you have received or are entitled to receive delivery of Shares as a result of this Agreement within the period beginning six months prior to the date of your Termination of Employment and ending twelve months following the date of your Termination of Employment, the Company, in its sole discretion, may require you to return or forfeit the cash and/or Shares received or receivable with respect to this Restricted Stock Units award, in the event that you engage in any of the following activities: 
       
           a. 
    performing services for or on behalf of any competitor of, or competing with, the Company or any Affiliate, within six months of the date of your Termination of Employment; 
              b. 
    unauthorized disclosure of material proprietary information of the Company or any Affiliate; 

c. 
    a violation of applicable business ethics policies or business policies of the Company or any Affiliate; or 
       
           d. 
    any other occurrence determined by the Committee. 
     The Company s right to require forfeiture must be exercised not later than 90 days after the Company acquires actual knowledge of such an activity but in no event later than twelve months after your Termination of Employment. Such right shall be deemed to be exercised upon the Company s mailing written notice of such exercise to your most recent home address as shown on the personnel records of the Company. In addition to requiring forfeiture as described herein, the Company may exercise its rights under this Section 3 by terminating the Restricted Stock Units awarded under this Agreement. 
  If you fail or refuse to forfeit the cash and/or shares of Common Stock demanded by the Company (the number of such shares of Common Stock as may be adjusted for any events described in Section 3.4 of the Plan), you shall be liable to the Company for damages equal to the number of Shares demanded times the highest closing price per share of the Common Stock during the period between the date of your Termination of Employment and the date of any judgment or award to the Company, together with all costs and attorneys  fees incurred by the Company to enforce this provision. 
  For purposes of this Section 3, forfeiture of Common Stock shall be effected by the redemption of such Common Stock in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and to the extent permissible under applicable law. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 3 shall have no application following a Change of Control, nor shall the Company s Incentive Compensation Forfeiture Policy apply following a Change of Control to the Restricted Stock Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement or to any proceeds in respect of such award. 
           4. 
    Change of Control  . Notwithstanding anything in Section 2 of this Agreement to the contrary, if a Change of Control of the Company occurs during the Restricted Period, then the Restricted Stock Units will become 100% vested upon such Change of Control, and the Company will issue to you a number of Shares equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) within six weeks following the Change of Control (unless such Change of Control is not an event described in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and the regulations thereunder (a  Section 409A Change of Control ), in which case such settlement shall be delayed until the Delayed Payment Date (as defined below)), provided that no such vesting or issuance shall occur if the Restricted Stock Units are replaced or continued by a Replacement Award that satisfies the requirements of Section 10.1(b) of the Plan. In the event that the Restricted Stock Units are replaced by a Replacement Award and you incur a Termination of Employment during the two years following a Change of Control by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason, such Replacement Award shall vest in full and be settled on the Delayed Payment Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the Delayed Payment Date means the first to occur of: (i) the date on which you incur a  separation from service  (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), or, if you are a  specified employee  (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) at the time of such  separation from service,  on the date that is six months following the date of your  separation from service  (ii) the originally scheduled vesting date for the applicable Restricted Stock Units; (iii) the date of your death; and (iv) the date of a Section 409A Change of Control. 
       
           5. 
    Dividend Equivalents  . You are entitled to receive dividend equivalents on the Restricted Stock Units generally in the same manner and at the same time as if each Restricted Stock Unit were a Share. These dividend equivalents will be credited to you in the form of additional Restricted Stock Units. The additional Restricted Stock Units will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. 
       
           6. 
    Withhold Taxes  . You are responsible to promptly pay any Social Security and Medicare taxes (together,  FICA ) due upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, and any Federal, State, and local taxes due upon distribution of the Shares. The Company and its Subsidiaries are authorized to deduct from any payment to you any such taxes required to be withheld. As described in Section 15.4 of the Plan and to the extent permissible under applicable law, you may elect to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units to satisfy all or part of the withholding tax requirements. You may also elect, at the time you vest in the Restricted Stock Units, to pay your FICA liability due with respect to those Restricted Stock Units out of those units. If you choose to do so, the Company will reduce the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units accordingly. The amount that is applied to pay FICA will be subject to Federal, State, and local taxes. 

7. 
    Limitation of Rights  . Except as set forth in the Agreement, until the Shares are issued to you in settlement of your Restricted Stock Units, you do not have any right in, or with respect to, any Shares (including any voting rights) by reason of this Agreement. Further, you may not transfer or assign your rights under the Agreement and you do not have any rights in the Company s assets that are superior to a general, unsecured creditor of the Company by reason of this Agreement. 
       
           8. 
    No Employment Contract  . Nothing contained in the Plan or Agreement creates any right to your continued employment or otherwise affects your status as an employee at will. You hereby acknowledge that the Company and you each have the right to terminate your employment at any time for any reason or for no reason at all. 
       
           9. 
    Amendment to Agreement Under Section 409A of the Code  . You acknowledge that the Agreement and the Plan, or portions thereof, may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, and that changes may need to be made to the Agreement to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. You agree that following the issuance of such rules, the Company may amend this Agreement as it deems necessary or desirable to avoid such adverse tax consequences; provided, however, that the Company shall accomplish such amendments in a manner that preserves your intended benefits under the Agreement to the greatest extent possible. 
       
           10. 
    Governing Law, Venue and Personal Jurisdiction  .  Notwithstanding anything contrary in the Plan, the validity, enforceability, construction and interpretation of the Plan or Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota.  You irrevocably waive any right to have the laws of any state or nation or other legal jurisdiction other than the State of Minnesota apply to the Plan or Agreement. Any dispute regarding the Plan or Agreement shall be exclusively decided by a state court in the State of Minnesota, and you irrevocably waive any right to have any such disputes decided in any jurisdiction or venue other than a state court in the State of Minnesota.      You irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state courts in the State of Minnesota for the purposes of any action arising out of or related to the Plan or Agreement, and irrevocably waive any right to remove any case commenced by Medtronic from a state court in the State of Minnesota to any federal court.

MEDTRONIC plc 
    
  LONG TERM PERFORMANCE AWARD AGREEMENT  
  AMENDED AND RESTATED 2013 STOCK AWARD AND INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
  Performance Period:  FY2019 to FY2021 
    
           1. 
    Performance Award.     Medtronic plc, an Irish public limited company ( Medtronic  or the  Company ), hereby grants to the individual named above ( you ) a Long-Term Performance Award (the  Award ) based on the target award specified above ( Target Award ), under the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement (the  Agreement ) and in the Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern.  Capitalized terms used but not defined shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Plan. 
       
           2. 
    Performance Targets.    The payout under this Award will be based on the following pre-established performance targets: 
       
           a) 
    Company performance will be measured using three criteria:  Revenue Growth rate ( Revenue Growth ), 3-year Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC ), and Relative Total Shareholder Return ( Relative TSR ) as shown in the grids below.  The performance measures will be weighted as follows:  Revenue Growth weighted 33.34%, ROIC weighted 33.33% and Relative TSR weighted 33.33%.  The award constituting the payout may be greater than, equal to, or less than the original amount based upon actual performance relative to these targets. 

The tables above show the percentage of the Target Award to be earned based on the actual Company performance against these three criteria for the three years of the award cycle.   
           b) 
    To determine payout, the percentage across the top of the grid is earned based on achievement of performance targets within the grid for each of the three performance measures, multiplied by the weight.  To illustrate, if Company performance results in Revenue Growth of 5%, ROIC of 15% and Relative TSR of 55%, the payout would be calculated as follows: 

3. 
    Calculation of Revenue Growth, ROIC and Relative TSR 
       
   Revenue Growth  is defined as Medtronic s 3-year cumulative compounded annual revenue growth measured at constant currency, but otherwise including all other GAAP components (acquisitions, divestitures, etc.).  Actual achievement of this performance measure is interpolated based on the matrix above. 
    
   Return on Invested Capital (with cash)  or  ROIC  is defined as Non-GAAP Earnings as reported to Investors plus Interest Expense net of Tax, divided by Invested Capital for each year, averaged over the 3 year period.   Invested Capital  is defined as Total Equity plus Interest Bearing Liabilities less Cash and Cash Equivalents. 
    
   Relative TSR  is defined as (end average share price x re-investment factor) -1 x 100 divided by the start average share price.  The re-investment factor equals the cumulative number of dividend shares divided by one share. 
    
           4. 
    Payment of Award.    Your Award will be paid in cash as soon as practicable following the end of the performance period. 
       
           5. 
    Withholding Taxes.    Your Award will be subject to taxes and withholding in accordance with applicable law. 
       
           6. 
    Termination.    In the event of your death, Disability or Retirement (as each such term is defined below) and provided you have completed a minimum of six months participation in the cycle, you will be eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of the Award based on the length of time you were employed during the performance period.  Any such pro-rata portion will be paid in cash as soon as practicable following the end of the performance period based on achievement of the performance targets.   If you terminate for a reason other than death, Disability or Retirement prior to the end of performance cycle, you will not be eligible to receive any Award payment.  For purposes of this Agreement, the terms  Disability   and   Retirement  shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms under any retirement plan of the Company which is qualified under Section 401 of the Code  (which currently provides for retirement on or after age 55, provided you have been employed by the Company and/or one or more Affiliates for at least ten years, or retirement on or after age 62), or under any disability or retirement plan of the Company or any Affiliate applicable to you due to employment by a non-U.S. Affiliate or employment in a non-U.S. location, or as otherwise determined by the Committee.   
       
           7. 
    Change of Control.    If a Change of Control of the Company occurs during the performance period, then this Award will accelerate and vest immediately to the full extent, and the Company will pay you the Target Award within six weeks following the Change of Control (unless such Change of Control is not an event described in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and the regulations thereunder (a  Section 409A Change of Control ), in which case such Award payment shall be delayed until the Delayed Payment Date (as defined below)), provided that no such vesting or payment shall occur if the Award is replaced or continued by a Replacement Award that satisfies the requirements of Section 10.1(b) of the Plan.  In the event that the Award is replaced by a Replacement Award and you incur a Termination of Employment during the two years following a Change of Control by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason, such Replacement Award shall vest in full and be paid on the Delayed Payment Date.  For purposes of this Agreement, the Delayed Payment Date means the first to occur of:  (i) the date on which you incur a  separation from service  (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), or, if you are a  specified employee  (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) at the time of such  separation from service,  on the date that is six months following the date of your  separation from service  (ii) the originally scheduled vesting date for the applicable Award; (iii) the date of your death; and (iv) the date of a Section 409A Change of Control. 
       
           8. 
    Beneficiary Designation.    If a participant dies before completion of the Award cycle, a portion of the Award may be payable in accordance with the terms herein.  The Plan permits each participant to designate a beneficiary to receive payments that may be due in the event of death. 
       
           9. 
    Forfeiture of Award.    If you have received or been entitled to receive payment in cash as a result of this Award within the period beginning six months prior to termination of your employment with the Company or any Affiliate and ending when the Award terminates or is canceled, the Company, in its sole discretion, may require you to return or forfeit the cash received or receivable with respect to this Award, in the event you engage in any of the following activities: 
       
           a) 
    performing services for or on behalf of any competitor of, or competing with, the Company or any Affiliate within six months of the date of your termination of employment with the Company or any Affiliate;  
       
  b)  unauthorized disclosure of material proprietary information of the Company or any Affiliate;  

c)  a violation of applicable business ethics policies or business policies of the Company or any Affiliate; or 
    
           d) 
    any other occurrence determined by the Committee. 
     The Company s right to require forfeiture must be exercised not later than 90 days after the Company acquires actual knowledge of such an activity but in no event later than 12 months after your termination of employment with the Company or any Affiliate. Such right shall be deemed to be exercised upon the Company s mailing written notice of such exercise to your most recent home address as shown on the personnel records of the Company.  In addition to requiring forfeiture as described herein, the Company may exercise its rights under this Section 9 by terminating this Award. 
  If you fail or refuse to forfeit the cash demanded by the Company (adjusted for any events described in Section 3.4 of the Plan), you shall be liable to the Company for damages, including interest accrued from the date of written notice, together with all costs and attorneys  fees incurred by the Company to enforce this provision. 
           10. 
    Acknowledgment.    Your receipt of the Performance Award and this Agreement constitutes your agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan.  Your signature is not required in order to make this Agreement effective.
