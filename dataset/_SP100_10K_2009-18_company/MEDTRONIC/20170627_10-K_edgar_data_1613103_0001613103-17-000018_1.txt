Business 
  OVERVIEW 
  Medtronic plc, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, is among the world's largest medical technology, services and solutions companies - alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. Medtronic was founded in 1949 and today serves hospitals, physicians, clinicians, and patients in approximately   160   countries worldwide. We remain committed to a mission written by our founder in 1960 that directs us  to contribute to human welfare by the application of biomedical engineering in the research, design, manufacture, and sale of products to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life.  
  With innovation and market leadership, we have pioneered advances in medical technology in all of our businesses. Our commitment to enhance our offerings by developing and acquiring new products, wrap-around programs, and solutions to meet the needs of a broader set of stakeholders is driven by the following primary strategies: 
             
    Therapy Innovation: Delivering a strong launch cadence of meaningful therapies and procedures. 
                
    Globalization: Addressing the inequity in health care access globally, primarily in emerging markets. 
                
    Economic Value: Becoming a leader in value-based health care by offering new services and solutions to improve outcomes and efficiencies, lower costs by reducing hospitalizations, improve remote clinical management, and increase patient engagement. 
     Our primary customers include hospitals, clinics, third-party health care providers, distributors, and other institutions, including governmental health care programs and group purchasing organizations (GPOs). 
  On January 26, 2015 (Acquisition Date), Medtronic completed the acquisition of Covidien plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland (Covidien) in a cash and stock transaction valued at $50.0 billion. In connection with the transaction, Medtronic, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (Medtronic, Inc.), and Covidien were combined under and became subsidiaries of Medtronic plc. Covidien was a global leader in the development, manufacture and sale of healthcare products for use in clinical and home settings. On a pro forma basis, as if the Covidien merger had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2015, our combined net sales would have been   $28.4 billion  . The merger with Covidien provides us with increased financial strength and flexibility and is expected to meaningfully accelerate all three strategies discussed above. 
  We reorganized our reporting structure and aligned our segments and the underlying divisions and businesses in fiscal year 2015 due to the acquisition of Covidien. The majority of Covidien s operations are included in the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. For more information on our segments, please see Note   22   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  We currently function in four operating segments that primarily manufacture and sell device-based medical therapies. Our operating segments with each of their reported net sales for fiscal year 2017, along with their related divisions, are as follows:

  OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS 
  Research and Development 
  The markets in which we participate may be subject to rapid technological advances. Constant improvement of products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership. Our research and development (R D) efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve in order to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products, and less invasive and new technologies for new and  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  

emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. That commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. Furthermore, our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. We have not engaged in significant customer or government-sponsored research. 
  During fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , we spent   $2.2 billion   (  7.4   percent of net sales),   $2.2 billion   (  7.7   percent of net sales), and   $1.6 billion   (  8.1   percent of net sales) on R D, respectively. Our R D activities include improving existing products and therapies, expanding their indications and applications for use, and developing new therapies and procedures. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation, improving our R D productivity, driving growth in emerging markets, clinical evidence generation, and assessing our R D programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to our customers. 
  Acquisitions and Divestitures 
  Our strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients' health and extend lives requires a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop an all-encompassing portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through our R D efforts, historically we have relied, and expect to continue to rely, upon acquisitions, investments, and alliances to provide access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas and markets. 
  We expect to make future investments or acquisitions where we believe that we are able to stimulate the development of, or acquire new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives, and strengthen our existing businesses. Mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies are inherently risky and no assurance may be given that any of our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
  For additional information, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business," and "Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may not complete the planned disposition of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Patient Monitoring   Recovery division of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group on the anticipated timeline or at all, and, even if completed, we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate." 
  Acquisition of HeartWare International, Inc. 
    
  On August 23, 2016, the Cardiac and Vascular Group acquired HeartWare International, Inc. (HeartWare), a medical device company that develops and manufactures miniaturized implantable heart pumps, or ventricular assist devices, to treat patients around the world suffering from advanced heart failure. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately   $1.1 billion  . Based upon a preliminary acquisition valuation, we acquired   $602 million   of technology-based and customer-related intangible assets and   $23 million   of tradenames, and   $427 million   of goodwill. In addition, we acquired   $245 million   of debt through the acquisition, of which we redeemed   $203 million   as part of a cash tender offer in August 2016. The remaining   $42 million   of debt acquired is due December 2017. 
    
  Acquisition of Smith   Nephew's Gynecology Business 
    
  On August 5, 2016, the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group acquired Smith   Nephew's gynecology business, which expands and strengthens our minimally invasive surgical offerings and further complements its existing global gynecology business. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately   $350 million  . We acquired   $167 million   of customer-related and technology-related intangible assets and   $180 million   of goodwill. 
  Anticipated Divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency Businesses 
  On April 18, 2017, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Cardinal Health Inc. to sell the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the PMR division of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. Among the product lines included in the transaction are the dental/animal health, chart paper, wound care, incontinence, electrodes, SharpSafety, thermometry, perinatal protection, blood collection, compression, and enteral feeding offerings. The transaction also will include 17 dedicated manufacturing facilities. We will retain our Respiratory   Monitoring Solutions business, which includes airway, ventilators, monitors, sensors, and health informatics product lines, as well as our Renal Care Solutions business, both of which are within the PMR division. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

definitive agreement, we will receive $6.1 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments, with total after-tax proceeds estimated to be approximately $5.5 billion.  
  Patents and Licenses 
  We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We have filed and obtained numerous patents in the U.S. and abroad, and regularly file patent applications worldwide in our continuing effort to establish and protect our proprietary technology. U.S. patents typically have a 20-year term from the application date while patent protection outside the U.S. varies from country to country. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. We have also obtained certain trademarks and tradenames for our products to distinguish our genuine products from our competitors  products, and we maintain certain details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business as a whole. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights have included ongoing review of third-party patents and patent applications. For additional information see  Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others  and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Markets and Distribution Methods 
  We sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the U.S. and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the U.S. For certain portions of our business, we also sell through distributors in the U.S. Our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals, surgi-centers and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, GPOs and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) primarily through third-party distributors, although we also have direct sales representatives. We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our three largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain under-penetrated. 
  Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide - including physicians, hospitals, other medical institutions, and GPOs. To achieve this objective, we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products. We believe that we maintain excellent working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry that enable us to gain a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments, trends, and emerging opportunities and respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and patients. We attempt to enhance our presence in the medical community through active participation in medical meetings and by conducting comprehensive training and educational activities. We believe that these activities contribute to physician expertise. 
  In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in health care delivery, the current trend among hospitals and other customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power. This enhanced purchasing power may lead to pressure on pricing and increased use of preferred vendors. Our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve. We are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales. 
  Competition and Industry 
  We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately   160   countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products. In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies. 
  Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, and publications about our products, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy, and quality systems in the medical device industry. In addition, in the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology,  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products. 
  Worldwide Operations 
  Our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect revenues, earnings, and cash flows from operations. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative contracts, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flow. See  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the repatriation of earnings of certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. may result in substantial U.S. tax cost. 
  For financial reporting purposes, net sales and property, plant, and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Production and Availability of Raw Materials 
  We manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Due to the U.S. FDA s requirements regarding manufacturing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our operations. We have reporting and disclosure requirements related to the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals" (tantalum, tin, tungsten (or their ores), and gold) which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Pursuant to these requirements, we are required to report on Form SD the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2016 calendar year, we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free. We may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.  
  For additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to "Item 2. Properties" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  Working Capital Practices 
  Our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to meet the product delivery needs of our customers. We also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers. 
  Employees 
  On   April 28, 2017  , we employed more than   91,000   full-time employees. Our employees are vital to our success. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits, and our rewarding work environment. 
  Seasonality 
  Worldwide sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality; however, the number of medical procedures incorporating Medtronic products is generally lower during summer months, due to summer vacation schedules in the northern hemisphere, particularly in European countries. In addition, pulse oximetry sales may be impacted by flu season.

Government Regulation and Other Considerations 
  Our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA and similar agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products. Our business is also affected by patient privacy laws, cost containment initiatives and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. The primary laws and regulations that affect our business are described below. 
  Product Approval Processes 
  Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device or technology in the U.S. is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device or technology is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device or technology. In this process, we must submit data that supports our equivalence claim. If human clinical data is required, it must be gathered in compliance with U.S. FDA investigational device exemption regulations. We must receive an order from the U.S. FDA finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device or technology before we are able to commercially distribute the new medical device or technology. Modifications to cleared medical devices or technologies may be made without using the 510(k) process if the changes do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness. Minimally Invasive Therapies Group products are generally subject to the pre-market notification process. A very small number of our devices are exempt from pre-market review. 
  The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval (PMA), requires us to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective. We do this by collecting data regarding design, materials, bench and animal testing, and human clinical data for the medical device. The U.S. FDA will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective. This determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device. This process is much more detailed, time-consuming, and expensive than the 510(k) process. A third, seldom used, process for approval exists for humanitarian use devices, intended for patient populations of less than 4,000 patients per year in the U.S. This exemption is similar to the PMA process; however, a full showing of product effectiveness from large clinical trials is not required. The threshold for approving these products is probable benefit and safety. 
  Many countries outside the U.S. to which we sell medical devices also subject such medical devices and technologies to their own regulatory requirements. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a country outside of the U.S. prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, some countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device or technology changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device or technology and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. Because export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations are complex and constantly changing, it is possible that laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute products. 
  In the E.U., a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. A notified body assesses the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the essential and other requirements within the medical device directive. We are subject to inspection by notified bodies for compliance. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries, generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health, oversee the clinical research for medical devices and are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. We are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws transcribing the medical device directives. A new Medical Device Regulation has been published by the E.U. in 2017 which will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. The regulation has a three-year implementation period, and after that time all products marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new requirements.  
  To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval, or  shonin.  The Japanese government, through the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW), regulates medical devices under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL). Oversight for medical devices is conducted with participation by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), a quasi-government organization performing many of the review functions for MHLW. Penalties for a company s noncompliance with PAL could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company s business license and criminal sanctions. MHLW and PMDA also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the requirements of the PAL. Medtronic is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies.

Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent, and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, on existing regulations. Certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future. There may be no assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be approved in a timely or cost-effective manner or approved at all. 
    
  Ongoing U.S. FDA Regulations 
    
  Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under U.S. FDA regulations. The U.S. FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers  required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the U.S. FDA for compliance with the U.S. FDA s quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other U.S. regulatory bodies (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General) monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products. Although surgeons are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the U.S. FDA, the U.S. FDA has prohibited manufacturers from promoting products for such  off-label  uses, and has taken the position that manufacturers may only market their products for cleared or approved uses. 
    
  If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The U.S. FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U. S. Department of Justice. Conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct. 
  In April 2015, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. FDA relating to our Pain Therapies division's SynchroMed drug infusion system and the Neuromodulation quality system.  The consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the SynchroMed pump and the Neuromodulation quality system.  The consent decree limits our ability to manufacture and distribute the SynchroMed drug infusion system, unless specific conditions are met.  The agreement does not require the retrieval of any of our products, but we must retain a third-party expert to inspect the Neuromodulation quality system and to provide a certification that the system complies with the requirements of the consent decree.  Once this certification is accepted by the U.S. FDA, and a U.S. FDA inspection is successfully completed, the limitations on manufacturer and distribution of SynchroMed pumps will be lifted.  Thereafter, we must submit periodic audit reports to the U.S. FDA to ensure ongoing compliance with the consent decree. 
    
  In June 2016, TYRX, Inc. received a Warning Letter from the U.S. FDA following an inspection at the TYRX facility in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey.  We are taking action to address the Warning Letter and upon successful reinspection by the U.S. FDA, the Warning Letter will be lifted.  
    
  In June 2014, HeartWare Inc. received a Warning Letter from the U.S. FDA following an inspection at the HeartWare facility in Miami Lakes, Florida.  Medtronic acquired HeartWare in August 2016, and is implementing actions and process improvements to address the items in the Warning Letter. Upon successful reinspection by FDA, the Warning Letter will be lifted.

Governmental Trade Regulations 
  The sale and shipment of our products and services across borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from different countries, subject us to extensive governmental trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale, shipment, and provision of goods, services and technology across borders. Because we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties, or liabilities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import and export activities. 
  The U.S. FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), administers controls over the import of medical devices into the U.S. The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. Medtronic is also subject to foreign trade controls administered by several U.S. government agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department and the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Treasury Department. We import raw materials, components and finished products into the countries in which we transact business. We act as the importer of record in many instances, but we also sell and ship goods to third parties who are themselves responsible for complying with applicable trade laws and regulations. In our role as importer of record, we are directly responsible for complying with customs laws and regulations concerning the importation of our raw materials, components and finished products. If applicable government agencies were to determine that we or such third parties were not in compliance with applicable U.S. FDA or customs laws and regulations when engaging in cross-border transactions involving our products, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability, depending on the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability. In addition, such determinations may cause supply chain disruptions and delays in the distribution of our products that impact our business activities. 
  Many countries control the export and re-export of goods, technology and services for reasons including public health, national security, regional stability, antiterrorism policies and other reasons. In certain circumstances, approval from governmental authorities may be required before goods, technology or services are exported or re-exported to certain destinations, to certain end-users and for certain end-uses. In addition, sales of our medical devices to customers outside of the U.S. for medical devices that have not received U.S. FDA approval are subject to U.S. FDA export requirements. Some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct export activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If applicable government agencies were to determine that we, or the third parties through which we export goods, were not in compliance with applicable export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability, dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability. Similarly, such determinations may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sales of our products, or result in restrictions being placed upon our distribution and sales of products which may materially impact our business activities. 
  Anti-Boycott Laws 
  Under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their controlled-in-fact subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. Currently, the U.S. considers the Arab League boycott of Israel to constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott. We are responsible for ensuring we comply with the requirements of U.S. anti-boycott laws for all transactions in which we are involved. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, are determined to have violated U.S. anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability, dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability. Penalties for any violations of anti-boycott laws and regulations could include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from government contracts, loss of export privileges and the denial of certain tax benefits, including foreign tax credits, and outside U.S subsidiary deferrals. 
  Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
  As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity (relating to the confidentiality and security of our information technology systems, products such as medical devices, and other services provided by us) may result in increased costs, lower revenue, new complexities in compliance, new challenges for competition, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property, and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

For example, in the U.S. the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, international and industry levels. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH),  govern the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by  Covered Entities,  (which are health care providers that submit electronic claims, health plans, and health care clearinghouses) and by their  Business Associates  (which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a Covered Entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the Covered Entity s workforce). Rules under HIPAA and HITECH include specific security standards and breach notification requirements. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (through the Office of Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against Covered Entities and Business Associates with regard to both the Security and Privacy Rules, including civil and criminal liability. Medtronic is generally not a Covered Entity, with a few exceptions such as our Diabetes business, Medtronic Monitoring, Inc., Beacon IDTF, and our health insurance plans. Medtronic also operates as a Business Associate to Covered Entities in a limited number of instances. In those cases, the patient data that we receive and analyze may include protected health information. There are comparable state level laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by health care providers, and Medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses.  
  The U.S. FDA has issued guidance advising manufacturers to take cybersecurity risks into account in product design for connected medical devices and systems, to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or modification to medical devices that contain software and reduce the risk of introducing threats into hospital systems that are connected to such devices. The U.S. FDA also issued guidance on post market management of cyber security in medical devices.  
  In addition to the regulation of personal health information, a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information such as social security numbers or that are designed to protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with 48 U.S. states now enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. 
  Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. We serve customers in approximately 160 countries. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the E.U., increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that will have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry are scheduled to go into effect in May 2018.  
  These laws and regulations impact the ways in which we use and manage personal data, protected health information, and our information technology systems. They also impact our ability to move, store, and access data across geographic boundaries. Compliance with these requirements may require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and add complexity and additional management and oversight needs. They also may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data.   
  Because the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant cost expenditures or changes in products or business that reduce revenue.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. 
  Cost Containment Initiatives 
  Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Hospitals, which purchase implants, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that may participate  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from the physicians  collective change in practice patterns such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products. 
  Some third-party payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical device may have been cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or that the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement. Examples of cost containment initiatives and health care reforms in markets significant to Medtronic's business outside of the U.S. include Japan, where the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years, which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures. As a result of our manufacturing efficiencies, cost controls and other cost-savings initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to respond to changes resulting from the worldwide trend toward cost-containment; however, uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation, new or changed coverage and reimbursement from government or private payers or decisions, or other reforms, making it difficult for us to predict the potential impact of cost-containment trends on future operating results. 
  Regulations Governing Reimbursement 
  The delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by HHS and comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care. Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services. 
  U.S. federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally-funded health care programs. The principal U.S. federal laws include: (1) the Anti-kickback Statute, which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of purchasing, ordering, recommending making referrals to items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program; (2) the False Claims Act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded health care program, including claims resulting from a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute; (3) the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician s immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider; and (4) health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payer. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers. Insurance companies may also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. In addition, as a manufacturer the U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Further, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) may be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. 
  The laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us, including those described above, are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Our profitability and operations are subject to risks relating to changes in legislative, regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.

Environmental Health and Safety Laws 
  We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Similar to other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and/or cash flows. 
  Litigation Risks 
  Patent Litigation     We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incidents to our business, we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. For additional information, see  Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.  and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Product Liability and Other Claims     We operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. We are also susceptible to other litigation, including private securities litigation, shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation. These claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of product liability litigation, we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. For additional information, see  Item 1A. Risk Factors - Quality problems with, and product liability claims in connection with, our processes, products, and services, could lead to recalls or safety alerts, harm to our reputation, or adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows  and Note   20   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Insurance 
  We have elected to self-insure most of our insurable risks, and we made this decision based on costs and availability factors in the insurance marketplace. We continue to maintain a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy providing coverage for our directors and officers. We continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to us of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future. Based on historical loss trends, we believe that our self-insurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses. Historical trends, however, may not be indicative of future losses. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Risks Relating to the Company 
  We operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively. 
  We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately   160   countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, technologies, or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our products or proposed products less competitive. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies.  
  Competitive factors include: 
             
    product reliability, 
                
    product performance, 
                
    product technology, 
                
    product quality, 
                
    breadth of product lines, 
                
    product services, 
                
    customer support, 
                
    price, and 
                
    reimbursement approval from health care insurance providers. 
     We also face competition for marketing, distribution, and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research, seek patient protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies. 
  Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, and publications about our products; reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy, and quality systems in our industry. In the current environment of managed care, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create, invest in, or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, and manufacture and successfully market our products. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success in our industry. 
  Reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for supply or other manufacturing difficulties, may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales. 
  The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. We manufacture most of our products at numerous manufacturing facilities located throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. However, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful. In addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the U.S. FDA regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner and to make our related product sales. 
  Other problems in the manufacturing process, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors, could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues. 
  In addition, several of our key products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of such facilities, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

the previous levels or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost. 
  Moreover, pursuant to the conflict minerals requirements promulgated by the SEC as a part of Dodd-Frank, we are required to report on the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, as well as the process we use to determine the source of such materials. We will continue to incur expenses as we work with our suppliers to evaluate the source of any conflict minerals in our products, and compliance with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of our raw materials. 
  Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater regulation in the future. 
  Our medical devices and technologies and our business activities are subject to a complex regime of regulations and an aggressive enforcement environment, including by the U.S. FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services-Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. In addition, certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers. As a result, we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to health care providers licensed by certain states and to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the federal level. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we will continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies, systems, and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations. 
  We are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. 
  Our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA and comparable agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain such approval or clearance, it may: 
             
    take a significant amount of time, 
                
    require the expenditure of substantial resources, 
                
    involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance, 
                
    involve modifications, repairs, or replacements of our products, and 
                
    result in limitations on the proposed uses of our products. 
     Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under U.S. FDA regulations. Many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA to determine compliance with the U.S. FDA s requirements, including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on U.S. FDA s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. Since 2009, the U.S. FDA has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, including medical device companies, by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of non-U.S governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U. S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. 
  In addition, the U.S. FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for  off-label  uses, including actions alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of products promoted for  off-label  uses constitute false and fraudulent claims to the government. The failure to  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  

comply with  off-label  promotion restrictions can result in significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government. 
  Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals" (tantalum, tin, tungsten (or their ores), and gold) which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Under the rules, we are now required to disclose the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2016 calendar year, we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free. In addition, we may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement. 
  Governmental regulations outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future. In the European Union, for example, a new Medical Device Regulation was published in 2017 which, when it enters into full force, will impose significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. Penalties for a company s non-compliance with governmental regulation could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company s business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. Any governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us. 
  We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation. 
  We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents in medical products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for medical devices. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under such laws and regulations, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we violate these environmental laws and regulations, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens. 
  In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal and remedial costs under certain U.S. federal and state laws are retroactive, strict and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. 
  We may in the future be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our past, present or future business activities (including the past activities of companies we have acquired). The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flow. 
  Our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows. 
  Our devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services (CMS) as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services. The principal U.S. federal laws implicated include those that prohibit (i) the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment, known as the false claims laws, (ii) unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded health care programs, known as the anti-kickback laws, and (iii) health care service providers from seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider, known as the Stark law. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers. Insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action claiming treble damages against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, RICO. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. 
  Our profitability and international operations are subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies, and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the U.S. and around the world. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement system in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. 
  The laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us, including those described above, are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by CMS. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows. 
  We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others. 
  We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation against us can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation, we believe the results associated with any such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which would generally have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
  While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents, trade secrets, or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, pending patent applications owned by us may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge. 
  In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Quality problems with, and product liability claims in connection with, our processes, products, and services, could lead to recalls or safety alerts, harm to our reputation, or adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows. 
  Quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. Component failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions, which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Due to the strong name recognition of the Medtronic and Covidien brands, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future. 
  Strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fail to meet these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Our success also depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precision-engineered components, subassemblies, and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation, competitive advantage and market share could be harmed. In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data. 
  Further, we have elected to self-insure with respect to product liability risks and any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be costly to defend and resolve. See "Our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses." Any of the foregoing problems, including product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
  Health care policy changes, including U.S. health care reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect on us. 
  In response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. health care system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the  ACA ) and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together "the law" or "the legislation") provide for a number of healthcare policy changes that are or will be applicable to us. However, there are many programs and requirements under the law for which the consequences are not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impacts will ultimately be from the law. The legislation provides for significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3 percent excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales that commenced in January 2013. Although the excise tax has been suspended by Congress until the end of 2017, its status is unclear for 2018 and subsequent years. Under the legislation, the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately $20 billion over 10 years. The law also focuses on a number of Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs. It is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequences these provisions will have on patient access to new technologies. The Medicare provisions include value-based payment programs, increased funding of comparative effectiveness research, reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination (such as bundled physician and hospital payments). Additionally, the law includes a reduction in the annual rate of inflation for Medicare payments to hospitals that began in 2011 and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend ways of reducing the rate of growth in Medicare spending.  
  Currently, the U.S. Congress is considering legislation to repeal and replace the ACA. We cannot predict whether the ACA will be repealed, replaced, or modified or how such repeal, replacement or modification may be timed or structured. As a result, we cannot quantify or predict the effect of such repeal, replacement, or modification might have on our business and results of operations. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses. 
  We have elected to self-insure most of our insurable risks across the company, and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace. We manage and maintain a portion of our self-insured program through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. We continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with a third party insurer that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the company. We continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future. Although we believe, based on historical loss trends, that our self-insurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses, historical trends may not be indicative of future losses. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
    
  If we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our results of operations will suffer. 
    
  We may experience decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure experienced by our customers from managed care organizations and other third-party payers, increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates, and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers. If the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our results of operations will be adversely affected. 
  We may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of changes in prices for oil, gas and other commodities. 
  We use resins, other petroleum-based materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products. Prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Oil, gas and pulp prices are volatile and may increase, resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products. New laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of our customers and third-party payers, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
  Economic and political instability around the world could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations. 
  There can be no assurance that economic and political instability around the world will not adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers and vendors may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. As with our customers and vendors, these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. In addition, a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries. In light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located outside the U.S. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  We are subject to a variety of market and financial risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results. 
  Although our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, we are a global company. Operations in countries outside of the U.S., which account for approximately 44 percent of our net sales for fiscal year 2017, are accompanied by certain financial and other risks that would not be faced by a company operating purely within the U.S. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets, which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations. Our profitability and international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: 
             
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates, 
                
    healthcare reform legislation, 
                
    multiple non-U.S. regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products, 
                
    local product preferences and product requirements, 
                
    longer-term receivables than are typical in the U.S., 
                
    trade protection measures, tariffs and other border taxes, and import or export licensing requirements, 
                
    less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the U.S. than exists in the U.S., 
     
   22 

     Table of Contents  

different labor regulations and workforce instability, 
                
    political instability, 
                
    the potential payment of U.S. income taxes on earnings of certain controlled foreign subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxation upon repatriation, 
                
    the expiration and non-renewal of foreign tax rulings and/or grants, 
                
    potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, and 
                
    economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations. 
     There are recent legislative proposals to tax profits of U.S. affiliates which are earned abroad. While it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented, or how they will ultimately impact us, they may materially impact our results of operations if, for example, our profits earned abroad are subject to U.S. income tax, or we are otherwise disallowed deductions as a result of these profits. 
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as  Brexit .  As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the E.U.  Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities.  Similarly, from time to time proposals are made in the U.S. to significantly change existing trade agreements and relationships between the U.S. and other countries, although we cannot currently predict whether or how these changes will be implemented. Changes to trade policy may adversely affect our operations and financial results. 
  Finally, changes in currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our revenues outside the U.S, net of expenses, and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes. 
  The failure to comply with U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions. 
  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. 
  Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and prohibit improper practices. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
  Laws and regulations governing the export of our products could adversely impact our business. 
  The U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Due to our international operations, we are subject to such laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations. 
  From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba and those in the region of Crimea. Certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and surgical tools, and may provide related services, to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. 
  In response to a variety of actions by legislators, regulators, and third party payers to reduce the perceived rise in healthcare costs, many health care industry companies, including health care systems, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry, our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows would suffer. 
  Our business is indirectly subject to health care industry cost-containment measures that could result in reduced sales of medical devices and medical devices containing our components. 
  Most of our customers, and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies, and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. If third-party payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients, sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components. The cost-containment measures that health care providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals. 
  In an effort to reduce costs, many existing and potential customers for our products within the U.S. have become members of GPOs and IDNs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangement with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs across our product portfolio. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability. 
  While having a contract with a GPO and IDN for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that GPO or IDN, such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales volumes of those products will be maintained. GPOs and IDNs increasingly are awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category. Even when we are the sole contracted supplier of a GPO or IDN for a certain product category, members of the GPO or IDN generally are free to purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, GPO and IDN contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days  notice. Accordingly, although we have multiple contracts with many major GPOs and IDNs, the members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors, which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability. 
  Our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful. 
  Our strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller, healthier lives requires a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts, historically we have relied, and expect to continue to rely, upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas. 
  We expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses. Investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

The continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals. 
  If we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals, many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability. The research, development, marketing, and sales of many of our new and improved products is dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing, and sale of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants, inventors, and public speakers. If we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
  Cyber-attacks or other disruptions to our information technology systems could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.  
  We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business, and many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology. We rely on information technology systems to collect and process customer orders, manage product manufacturing and shipping, and support regulatory compliance, and we routinely process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including sensitive personal information, protected health information, and business information. Many of our products and services incorporate software and information technology that allow patients and physicians to be connected and collect data regarding a patient and the therapy he or she is receiving, or that otherwise allow the products or services to operate as intended. We could experience, and in the past have experienced, attempted or actual interference with the integrity of, and interruptions in, our technology systems, as well as data breaches. We could also experience attempted or actual interference with the integrity of our products and data. These incidents could materially harm our business and our reputation. 
  As is the case with other large enterprises, the size and complexity of our products, services, and information technology systems can make them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, breakdown, interruptions, destruction, loss or compromise of data, obsolescence or incompatibility among systems, or other significant disruptions. Unauthorized persons may attempt to inappropriately access our products or systems in order to disrupt, disable or degrade such products or services, or to obtain proprietary or confidential information. Such unauthorized access or interference with our products or services could create issues with product functionality which could pose a risk to patient safety, and a risk of product recall or field activity.  
  We have programs, processes and technologies in place to prevent, detect, contain, respond to and mitigate security related threats and potential incidents. We undertake considerable ongoing improvements to our systems, connected devices and information-sharing products in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and can be difficult to detect, anticipating, identifying or preventing these intrusions or mitigating them if and when they occur, may be challenging. 
  We also rely on third party vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems. Third party systems may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or unexpectedly compromise the information security of our own systems, and we are dependent on these third parties to provide reliable systems and software and to deploy appropriate security programs to protect their systems. 
  In addition, we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions. As a result of acquisitions, we may face risks due to implementation, modification, or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies relating to data privacy and cybersecurity at the acquired company. We continue to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate, and to upgrade and expand our information system capabilities for stable and secure business operations. 
  If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and prevent disruptions, outages, or data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. Our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection and cyber security laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. The variety of U.S. and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in "Item 1. Business - Other Factors Impacting Our Operations - Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations."  We have programs to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations.  However, there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies. Enforcement actions may be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyber attacks. While Medtronic has not been named in any such suits, if a substantial breach or loss of data were to occur, we could become a target of such litigation.

Our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating, protecting, upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities, continuing to build security into the design of our products, and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our information technology systems, products or services or sensitive data are compromised, patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality, and we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws, state laws, or the laws of other jurisdictions, experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, product failure, information technology outages or disruptions, or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation. 
  Negative conditions in global credit markets may impair our ability to issue debt securities and impact the liquidity and/or market value of investments in marketable debt securities, which may cause us losses and liquidity issues. 
  We have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Our debt securities include government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, debt funds, and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. Market conditions over the past several years have included periods of significant economic uncertainty and at times general market distress. During these periods, we may experience reduced liquidity across the fixed-income investment market, including the securities in which we invest. In the event we need to sell these securities, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner or for a value that is equal to the underlying principal. In addition, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the securities and record an impairment charge. If we determine that the fair value of such securities is temporarily impaired, we would record a temporary impairment as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within shareholders  equity. If it is determined that the fair value of these securities is other-than-temporarily impaired, we would record a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
  Negative market conditions may also impair our ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities or may negatively impact our ability to borrow from financial institutions. 
  Our products are continually the subject of clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors, or other third parties, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors, or by third parties, or the market s or U.S. FDA s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business. 
  As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies, we have made several acquisitions in recent years, including the 2015 acquisition of Covidien, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so. Factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include: 
             
    the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies, 
                
    our ability or inability to integrate information technology systems of acquired companies in a secure and reliable manner, 
                
    adverse developments arising out of investigations by governmental entities of the business practices of acquired companies, including potential liability imposed by FCPA, 
     
   26 

     Table of Contents  

any decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies  product lines and sales and marketing practices, including price increases, 
                
    our ability to retain key employees, and 
                
    the ability of the combined company to achieve synergies among its constituent companies, such as increasing sales of the combined company s products, achieving cost savings, and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. 
     We also could experience negative effects on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. 
  We may not complete the planned disposition of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Patient Monitoring   Recovery division of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group on the anticipated timeline or at all, and, even if completed, we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate. 
  In April 2017, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Patient Monitoring   Recovery division of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group to Cardinal Health, Inc. for $6.1 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments, with total after-tax proceeds estimated to be approximately $5.5 billion.  We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of our 2018 fiscal year, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.  In connection with the transaction, we announced that we anticipate a number of benefits from the disposition, including improvements in our revenue growth rate and operating margin, a lower debt leverage ratio, and an increased ability to fund potential investments in higher growth and higher margin opportunities.  
  The disposition transaction is complex in nature, subject to various conditions, and may be adversely affected by unanticipated developments and unexpected changes in market or other conditions. If any closing conditions are not met, the closing of the disposition transaction may be delayed or fail to occur, and we may not achieve the intended benefits we anticipate. Moreover, if the disposition is not completed on the anticipated timeline or at all, our ongoing operation of the Patient Monitoring   Recovery division may be harmed. 
  Even if the disposition transaction is completed, we may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits, including the financial and operational benefits described above, and our future investments and other business opportunities that we anticipate will be facilitated by the disposition may not be successful and may prove not to be superior alternatives to the continued operation of our current Patient Monitoring   Recovery division. Further, execution of the proposed disposition will require significant time and attention from management and other employees, including following the closing of the disposition transaction, which may divert the attention of our management and other employees from the execution of our other initiatives and could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  The expansion of our services and solutions business may not yield the revenue we expect and will expose us to new risks. 
  We are increasingly focusing on our services and solutions businesses and the creation of comprehensive value-based healthcare offerings, in which payment is based on measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon. These offerings include care management services, cath lab and operating room managed services, and solutions for chronic disease management. We intend to expand our services and solutions model across all of our business groups and across geographic regions. However, we remain in the relatively early stages of developing and implementing this business model. As a result, we will need to invest significant expense and management resources into developing our expertise and executing our strategies, and our efforts may not be profitable. 
  In addition, the expansion of our services and solutions business model will expose us to, or increase our exposure to, a variety of regulations in the various countries we provide services and solutions, including regulations related to government payments, fraud and abuse, patient privacy, and the corporate practice of medicine. Compliance with these regulations may prove to be more costly than we anticipate, and we may not successfully comply with such regulations. These regulatory costs may slow our expansion into these business areas and may have a negative effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
  The medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations into marketing and other business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, divert the attention of our management, and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  We are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. FDA and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. These authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. We occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies, including, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

of Inspector General of HHS. These investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance, and product promotional practices. 
  We cooperate with these investigations and respond to such requests. However, when an investigation begins, we cannot predict when it will be resolved, the outcome of the investigation, or its impact on us. An adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies and amendments to existing CIAs. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations. Finally, if these investigations continue over a long period of time, they could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of our business and impose significant administrative burdens, including cost, on us. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations or other investigations initiated by a government at any time, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business. 
  At April 28, 2017, our total consolidated external debt was approximately $33.4 billion. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including: 
             
    making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; 
                
    increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged; 
                
    limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
                
    limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and 
                
    exposing us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under our floating rate notes and revolving credit facility is variable. 
     Our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business, acquisitions, and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. If our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt, which could harm our long-term business prospects. Our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. Our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  
  Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside the U.S. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, legislation in 2010 imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers for U.S. sales of medical devices beginning in January 2013. Proposals for fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Medtronic, Inc. tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. 
  In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report for Medtronic Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreements with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. On December 23, 2010, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency with respect to the remaining issues. Medtronic, Inc. filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court on March 21, 2011 objecting to the deficiency. During October and November 2012, Medtronic, Inc. reached a resolution with the IRS on various matters, including the deductibility of a settlement payment. Medtronic, Inc. and the IRS agreed to hold one issue, the calculation of amounts eligible for the one-time repatriation holiday, because that issue was being addressed by other taxpayers in litigation with the IRS. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The U.S. Tax Court proceeding with respect to this issue began on February 3, 2015 and ended on March 12, 2015. On June 9, 2016, the U.S. Tax court issued its opinion with respect to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The U.S. Tax Court generally rejected the IRS s position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. During November 2016, Medtronic and the IRS entered into a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the Tax Court which resolved the one-time repatriation holiday as an outstanding issue unless either party decided to appeal the Tax Court Opinion and a final decision is inconsistent with the U.S. Tax Court Opinion. The U.S. Tax Court entered their final decision on January 25, 2017. On April 21, 2017 the IRS filed their Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit regarding the Tax Court Opinion.  A hearing date for the Appeal has not been set. A decision by the 8   th    Circuit Court of Appeals overturning the Tax Court Opinion could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.  
  Examination and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 
  The Company has provided reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the Company s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable, we would incur additional charges to expense and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  If the distribution of Mallinckrodt ordinary shares to Covidien shareholders in 2013, or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2013 separation, are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. 
  Covidien received an IRS ruling substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) certain transactions effected in connection with its 2013 separation of Mallinckrodt qualify as transactions under Sections 355 and/or 368(a) of the Code, and (ii) the distribution qualifies as a transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition to obtaining the IRS ruling, Covidien received a tax opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher   Flom LLP, in form and substance acceptable to Covidien, which relied on the effectiveness of the IRS ruling, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution and certain transactions entered into in connection with the distribution qualify as transactions under Sections 355 and/or 368(a) of the Code. 
  The private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings in the case of the 2013 separation, from Covidien and Mallinckrodt, regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the tax opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the 2013 distribution or the related internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the respective facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distributions, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions that are not covered by the IRS rulings. 
  We could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations, whether under applicable law or the tax matters agreement that was entered into with Mallinckrodt, if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2013 distribution are taxable. 
  Our tax position may be adversely affected by changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations. 
  Recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, limit the ability of foreign-owned corporations to deduct interest expense, tax the accumulated unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, impose a minimum tax on the future offshore earnings of U.S. multinational groups, and to make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations.

     Table of Contents  

Additionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of  base erosion and profit shifting,  where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S., Ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business. 
  Moreover, tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies that result from a cross-border business combination (such as us), which may lead such authorities to assert that we owe additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
  Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation 
  Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. 
  It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland. 
  As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. 
  As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval, which may limit Medtronic's flexibility to manage its capital structure. 
  Under Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.  Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution. Such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares.  Accordingly, our articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, provisions authorizing the board to issue new shares, and to disapply statutory preemption rights.  The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.   
  A transfer of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty. 
  Transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (DTC) will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if you hold our shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of your shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your shares.

In certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax. 
  In certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and other specified countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax. 
  Shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax, provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us). However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of their shares. 
  Shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in our Company (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who receive dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends. 
  Our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax. 
  Irish capital acquisitions tax (CAT) could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold which Irish Revenue typically updates annually in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents. 
  Risks Relating to the Covidien Acquisition (the Transaction) 
  We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Transactions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien. 
  Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors, we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the transaction. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: 
             
    the diversion of management s attention to integration matters; 
                
    difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the businesses; 
                
    difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; 
                
    difficulties in the assimilation of employees; 
                
    difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;  
                
    challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; and  
                
    challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel. 
     Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the Transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Furthermore, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien. All of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction, and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares. As a result, we cannot assure you that the combination of the Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction.

Future potential changes to the U.S. tax laws could result in us being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and the IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S federal income tax purposes. 
  Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even so, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). 
  Under Section 7874 of the Code, if Medtronic Inc. s shareholders immediately prior to the Transaction hold 80% or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in Medtronic, Inc. immediately after the Transaction (the ownership test), and our expanded affiliated group after the Transaction does not have substantial business activities in Ireland relative to its worldwide activities (the substantial business activities test), we would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Based on the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code, Medtronic, Inc. s shareholders received approximately 70% of our ordinary shares (by both vote and value) by reason of holding stock in Medtronic, Inc. Therefore, under current law, we should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, there is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874, including the application of the ownership test. 
  In addition, changes to Section 7874 or the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application. 
  Since Section 7874 was enacted, there have been various legislative proposals to broaden its scope. Such proposals could, among other things, treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a U.S. corporation under Section 7874 if the former shareholders of the U.S. corporation own more than 50% of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the transaction, or if the foreign corporation s affiliated group has substantial business activities in the U.S. and the foreign corporation is primarily managed and controlled in the U.S. Accordingly, if enacted in their present form and retroactively effective to apply to the Transactions, such proposals could cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. 
  If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, based on our existing expected cash flows, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation. 
  Specifically, if we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we would be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on our worldwide income, and the income of our foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. tax when repatriated or when deemed recognized under the U.S. tax rules for controlled foreign corporations (CFC's). Additionally, Covidien's foreign corporations, which are not currently CFC's, would become CFC's making them potentially subject to current or future U.S. taxation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
  The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS may promulgate rules that would adversely affect our tax position. 
  The U.S. Treasury Department could make changes in the regulatory rules affecting companies that move their tax domicile outside the U.S. In the event the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS were to change the applicable regulatory rules, we could face potentially substantial tax costs as a result of the Transactions. We cannot assess the potential impact of any such possible changes, if adopted, until they are announced. 
  On April 4, 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued proposed and temporary regulations interpreting multiple sections of the Code, including Section 7874, to address inversion transactions and transactions that Treasury and the IRS characterize as  post-inversion tax avoidance transactions.  Such regulations generally apply to transactions completed on or after September 22, 2014, although in some cases they have a later effective date of April 4, 2016. The regulations expand the set of circumstances under which Section 7874 applies to cause the foreign acquirer of a U.S. corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such regulations also impose additional U.S. taxes on certain transactions involving the acquired U.S. corporation s CFC s. The regulations do not cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, if ultimately upheld by a reviewing court, the regulations limit our ability to engage in various intercompany transactions involving non-U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued final and temporary regulations on October 1, 2016, which might limit our ability to deduct interest expense on certain intercompany debt for U.S federal income tax purposes.

The Transaction may not allow us to maintain competitive global cash management and a competitive effective corporate tax rate. 
  While we believe that being incorporated in Ireland should help us maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate and provide flexible global cash management, we are unable to give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate nor global cash accessibility will be, however, because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we will operate. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate or global cash accessibility. 
  Legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business. 
  Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.

  Item 5. Market for Medtronic s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The Company s ordinary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  MDT.  
  The following table provides information about the shares repurchased by the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017:     

           (1) 
    In June 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized, subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves, the repurchase of   80 million   of the Company s ordinary shares (2015 Repo Authorization). In June 2017, the Company s Board of Directors replaced the existing 2015 Repo Authorization to redeem up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares with an authorization to expend up to an aggregate amount of   $5 billion   beginning June 26, 2017 to redeem the Company s ordinary shares.  
     On June 21, 2017, there were approximately 32,550 shareholders of record of the Company s ordinary shares. Ordinary cash dividends declared and paid totaled 43.0 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year   2017   and 38.0 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year   2016  . The following prices are the high and low market sales quotations per share of the Company s ordinary shares for the fiscal years and quarters indicated:

  Irish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital 
  Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies. Except as indicated below, dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities. The Financial Transfers Act, 1992, provides that the Irish Minister for Finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. For the purposes of this Act,  financial transfers  include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the European Communities if they had been made between Member States of the Communities. This Act has been used by the Minister for Finance to implement European Council Directives, which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries, organizations and people including the Al-Qaeda network and the Taliban, Afghanistan, Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), Democratic People s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Republic of Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria.

Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law. 
  Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders 
  Dividends paid by Medtronic will generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 percent) unless an exemption applies. 
  Dividends paid to U.S. residents will not be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax provided that: 

in the case of a beneficial owner of Medtronic shares held in the Depository Trust Company (DTC), the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the United States and this information is provided by the broker to the Company s qualifying intermediary; or 

in the case of a record owner, the record owner has provided to the Company s transfer agent a valid U.S Certification of Residence (Form 6166) or valid Irish Non-Resident Form V2. 
     Irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on Medtronic s ordinary shares. A U.S. resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold Medtronic shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any Irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by Medtronic. In addition, if a U.S. shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax, the withholding payment discharges any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder furnishes to the Irish Revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed. 
  While the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
  The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. You should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016   and for each of the three fiscal years ended   April 28, 2017   (fiscal year 2017),   April 29, 2016   (fiscal year 2016), and   April 24, 2015   (fiscal year   2015  ). Our fiscal year-end is the last Friday in April, and therefore, the total weeks in a fiscal year may fluctuate between 52 and 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2017 and 2015 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year, with the additional week occurring in the first quarter.  
  Early in the week of June 19, 2017, we experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our ability to manufacture devices and fulfill orders from customers in a large portion of our business. Our systems have now been fully restored. At this time, we do not believe our fiscal year 2018 results of operations or financial condition will be materially affected by this incident. 
  On January 26, 2015, the Company acquired Covidien and Medtronic, Inc. (collectively, the Transactions). Following the consummation of the Transactions, Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien became subsidiaries of the Company. In connection with the Transactions, the Company became the successor registrant to Medtronic, Inc. and re-registered as a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland. For fiscal year 2015, the results of operations of Covidien are reflected in the Company's results of operations for only the fourth quarter due to the timing of the acquisition of Covidien, which affects comparability throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  Organization of Financial Information        
  Management s Discussion and Analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures designed to enable investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Statements that are forward-looking and not historical in nature are subject to risks and uncertainties. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for more information. 
  The consolidated financial statements are presented within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of equity, consolidated statements of cash flows, and the related notes, which are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. 
  Financial Trends      
  Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that management uses to evaluate the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures."  
  Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management s review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the Company s ongoing operations and are useful for period over period comparisons of such operations. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company s operations. Investors should not consider results reflecting non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are cautioned that Medtronic may calculate results reflecting non-GAAP financial measures in a manner that is different from other companies. 
  The GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation presents non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends, but which include charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that management believes may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments).   
  In the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated. Because the effective rate may be significantly affected by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the provision for income taxes, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income from operations before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments.

  EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW 
  Medtronic is among the world's largest medical technology, services, and solutions companies - alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. We employ more than   91,000   full-time employees worldwide, serving physicians, hospitals, and patients in approximately   160   countries. Our primary products include those for cardiac rhythm disorders, cardiovascular disease, advanced and general surgical care, respiratory and monitoring solutions, neurological disorders, spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma, urological and digestive disorders, and ear, nose, and throat and diabetes conditions. 
  Net income attributable to Medtronic for fiscal year   2017   was   $4.0 billion  ,   $2.89   per diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to Medtronic of   $3.5 billion  ,   $2.48   per diluted share, for fiscal year   2016  , representing an increase of 14 percent and 17 percent, respectively. 
  The table below illustrates net sales by operating segment for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  : 

(1) 
    The Minimally Invasive Therapies Group was a new group in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 that contains the majority of Covidien's former operations. Revenue growth is compared to a full year of operations in fiscal year 2016. 
     Currency translation had an unfavorable impact of   $34 million   on net sales for fiscal year   2017  , as compared to fiscal year 2016 when using the average exchange rates in effect during fiscal year   2016  . Net sales growth for fiscal year   2017   was also unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, resulting from our 52/53 week fiscal year calendar. In addition, the fiscal year   2017   acquisitions of HeartWare and Smith   Nephew's gynecology business contributed   $200 million   to our total net sales growth. 
  Our performance continues to be fueled by our three growth strategies: therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value. We are creating competitive advantages and capitalizing on the long-term trends in healthcare: namely, the desire to improve clinical outcomes; the growing demand for expanded access to care; and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems. In our therapy innovation growth strategy, we continue to see strong adoption of our products across all our operating segments. Further discussion about our products is included within the operating segment sections below. In globalization, net sales in emerging markets and non-U.S. developed markets grew   7 percent   and   4 percent  , respectively, in fiscal year   2017   compared to fiscal year   2016  . In our third growth strategy, economic value, we continue to execute our value-based healthcare signature programs and remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume. See our discussion in the  Net Sales  section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for more information on the results of our operating segments. 
  GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation   We have provided non-GAAP financial measures, because we believe they provide meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate its review of our operational performance and as a basis for strategic planning. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations and are useful for period over period comparisons of such operations. Refer to our discussion in the "Costs and Expenses" and "Income Taxes" sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for more information on the Non-GAAP Adjustments. Investors should not consider results reflecting non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be cautioned that we may calculate results reflecting non-GAAP financial measures in a manner that is different from other companies.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  We have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect management's best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
  Our critical accounting estimates include the following: 
  Revenue Recognition     Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. We adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience and recognize such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. Adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant. Price adjustment rebates charged against gross sales were $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion in fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , respectively, and $679 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.  
  Litigation Contingencies     We are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, income tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations in the U.S. and around the world. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving us are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. Our significant legal proceedings are discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and while it is not possible to predict the outcome for  
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

most of the matters discussed, we believe it is possible that costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 
  Income Tax Reserves     We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is (i) a completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue (iii) a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iv) an expiration of the statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows. 
  Valuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill     When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price consideration over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and IPR D. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks. 
  The test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value, including projected future cash flows. We assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Goodwill was   $38.5 billion   and   $41.5 billion   at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. 
  We test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired. Our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, appropriate discount rates, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. We use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including, among others, changes in competitive conditions, timing of regulatory approval, results of clinical trials, changes in worldwide economic conditions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Definite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were   $22.8 billion   and   $26.2 billion   at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. 
  We assess the impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Our impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangibles require us to make several estimates about fair value, including projected future cash flows and the appropriate discount rates. Indefinite-lived intangible assets were   $594 million   and   $721 million   at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. 
  Contingent Consideration     Contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date at estimated fair value and is remeasured each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized within   acquisition-related items   in our consolidated statements of income. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration may result from changes in the estimated timing and amount of revenue, in the timing or probability of achieving the milestones which trigger payment, or in discount rates. The fair value of contingent consideration was   $246 million   and   $377 million   at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. 
   
  NET SALES 
  In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we amended the way in which we evaluate performance and allocate resources with the acquisition of Covidien. As a result, we began to operate under four reportable segments and four operating segments, the Cardiac and Vascular Group (composed of Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure, Coronary   Structural Heart, and Aortic   Peripheral Vascular divisions), the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (composed of Surgical Solutions and Patient Monitoring   Recovery divisions), the Restorative Therapies Group, and the Diabetes Group.

(1) 
    Growth rates are affected by the acquisition of Covidien in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Revenue growth is compared to a full year of operations in fiscal year 2016.  
      
  Cardiac and Vascular Group   
  The Cardiac and Vascular Group s products include pacemakers, insertable and external cardiac monitors, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRT-D), implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), leads and delivery systems, ventricular assist systems, ablation products, electrophysiology catheters, products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure devices, products designed to reduce surgical site infections, coronary and peripheral stents, balloons, and related delivery systems, endovascular stent graft systems, heart valve replacement technologies, cardiac tissue ablation systems, and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products. The Cardiac and Vascular Group also includes Care Management Services and Cath Lab Managed Services (CLMS) within the Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure division. The Cardiac and Vascular Group's net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $10.5 billion  , an increase of   3   percent compared to fiscal year 2016. Currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of   $37 million   as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year. The Cardiac and Vascular Group s net sales for fiscal year   2017   were unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The Cardiac and Vascular Group's net sales for fiscal year   2017  , as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, benefited from strong net sales in Arrhythmia Management within Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure, largely due to growth in AF Solutions and Diagnostics, Coronary   Structural Heart, largely due to transcatheter aortic heart valve in the U.S. and Europe, and in Aortic   Peripheral Vascular, as well as the acquisition of HeartWare in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. See the more detailed discussion of each division's performance below. 
  Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $5.6 billion  , an increase of   3 percent   compared to fiscal year 2016. Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure net sales growth for fiscal year   2017   was driven by strong growth in Arrhythmia Management, largely due to growth in AF Solutions and Diagnostics. The strong growth in AF Solutions was driven by the continued global acceptance of our Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter (Arctic Front) system, including strong growth in Japan. The strong growth in Diagnostics was driven by the continued adoption of the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor. Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure also benefited from the acquisition of HeartWare, which was acquired during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
  Coronary   Structural Heart net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $3.1 billion  , an increase of   1 percent   compared to fiscal year 2016. Coronary   Structural Heart net sales growth for fiscal year   2017   was largely driven by the continued launch of the Evolut R

34mm transcatheter aortic heart valve in the U.S. and Europe. Net sales growth was partially offset by challenges with drug-eluting stents in both the U.S. and Japan due to competitive pressures related to the anticipated approval of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stents in these countries, which received U.S. FDA approval during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and is expected to receive approval in Japan during the summer of fiscal year 2018. Net sales growth was also partially offset by continued pricing pressures and competition worldwide in our Coronary business. 
  Aortic   Peripheral Vascular net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $1.7 billion  , an increase of   6 percent   compared to fiscal year 2016. Aortic   Peripheral Vascular net sales growth for fiscal year   2017   was driven by the continued strong worldwide growth of the IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon as well as success of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System and the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft. Net sales growth as compared to fiscal year 2016 was also driven by the launch of the HawkOne 6 French directional atherectomy system in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
  The Cardiac and Vascular Group's net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $10.2 billion  , an increase of   9   percent compared to fiscal year 2015. The Cardiac and Vascular Group s fiscal year 2016 performance was favorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The Cardiac and Vascular Group s performance for fiscal year 2016 also benefited from the addition of the Covidien Peripheral business into the Aortic   Peripheral Vascular division in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and strong net sales across all three divisions. 
  Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $5.5 billion  , an increase of   4   percent compared to fiscal year 2015. The increase in Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure net sales was driven by strong growth in AF Solutions, with the continued global acceptance of our Arctic Front system. Additionally, net sales were driven by the continued adoption of the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor, and the launch of the Evera MRI SureScan ICD in the U.S. during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, with continued strong adoption through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Net sales for the Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure division were also affected by continued pricing pressures. 
  Coronary   Structural Heart net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $3.1 billion  , an increase of   2   percent compared to fiscal year 2015. Net sales were driven by the CoreValve Evolut R recapturable system in the U.S., which was launched late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and a strong CoreValve launch in Japan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. In addition, net sales of Coronary   Structural Heart division were driven by drug-eluting stents, including the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in Europe and the Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent in the U.S., and the recent launches of the NC Euphora and SC Euphora balloon dilatation catheters  .   Net sales were partially offset by continued pricing pressures in our Coronary business. 
  Aortic   Peripheral Vascular net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $1.6 billion  , an increase of   52   percent compared to fiscal year 2015. The Aortic   Peripheral Vascular division net sales performance benefited from the addition of the Covidien Peripheral business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. The increase in Aortic   Peripheral Vascular net sales was driven by strong growth of the IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon in the U.S. and globally, continued strength in Valiant Captiva TAA stent graft sales, continued solid adoption of our Aptus Heli-FX endoanchor, and continued adoption of the Endurant IIs Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) 3-piece system in the U.S. Net sales for the Aortic   Peripheral Vascular division were affected by increased competition in international markets and reimbursement cuts in Japan. 
  Looking ahead, we expect our Cardiac and Vascular Group could be affected by the following: 
             
    Changes in procedural volumes, competitive and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic risks, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, the timing of product registration approvals, replacement cycle challenges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  

Integration of our acquisition of HeartWare, a leading innovator of the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (HVAD System), to treat patients around the world suffering from advanced heart failure. The acquisition of HeartWare in August 2016 broadened the Medtronic portfolio of therapies, diagnostic tools and services for patients suffering from heart failure and is part of our therapy innovation strategy to surround the physician with innovative products while focusing on patients and disease states. 

Acceptance and future growth of the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system, which received CE Mark approval in February 2017 and launched in Europe during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. In the U.S., we received FDA approval in May 2017, and launched in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

The HawkOne system is designed to remove plaque from the vessel wall and restore blood flow. The new HawkOne 6F provides an effective and easy-to-use treatment option for patients with PAD both above and below the knee with a single device at a lower profile. 
      
  Minimally Invasive Therapies Group      
  The Minimally Invasive Therapies Group s products span the entire continuum of care with a focus on diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, pelvic region, kidneys, obesity, and preventable complications. The products include those for advanced and general surgical care, wound closure, electrosurgery products, hernia mechanical devices, mesh implants, advanced ablation, interventional lung, ventilators, capnography, airway products, sensors, monitors, compression, dialysis, enteral feeding, wound care, and medical surgical products. The Minimally Invasive Therapies Group s net sales for fiscal year 2017 were $  9.9 billion  , an increase of 4 percent compared to fiscal year 2016. Currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of $17 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year. The Minimally Invasive Therapies Group's net sales growth in fiscal year 2017 was unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The Minimally Invasive Therapies Group's net sales for fiscal year   2017  , as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, benefited from strong net sales in Surgical Solutions, largely due to growth in Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy, and Patient Monitoring   Recovery, largely due to Airways and Ventilation Management, as well as the acquisition of Smith   Nephew's gynecology business in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and Bellco in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. See the more detailed discussion of each division's performance below. 
  Surgical Solutions net sales for fiscal year 2017 were $  5.5 billion  , an increase of 5 percent compared to fiscal year 2016. Surgical Solutions net sales growth was driven by Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy. Advanced Stapling growth resulted from strong adoption of endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology, growth in emerging markets and the release of the Signia power stapling system. Advanced Energy growth resulted from the launch of the LigaSure vessel sealing instruments and continued adoption of the Valleylab FT10 energy platform. The launch of new LigaSure vessel sealing instruments along with the

Valleylab FT10 energy platform helped mitigate the negative impact of reprocessing. Surgical Solutions also benefited from the acquisition of Smith   Nephew's gynecology business, which was acquired during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
  Patient Monitoring   Recovery net sales for fiscal year 2017 were $  4.4 billion  , an increase of 3 percent compared to fiscal year 2016. Patient Monitoring   Recovery net sales growth was driven by strong Airways and Ventilation Management sales of the Puritan Bennett 980, strength in Patient Monitoring Nellcor pulse oximetry products, and growth in emerging markets. Patient Monitoring   Recovery also benefited from the acquisition of Bellco, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
  Surgical Solutions net sales for fiscal year 2016 were $5.3 billion. The net sales performance in Surgical Solutions was mainly attributable to Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy. Advanced Stapling products benefited from continued worldwide market adoption of the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload. Advanced Energy products benefited from continued strong adoption of the LigaSure Maryland Jaw and Valleylab FT10 energy platform. Further, Early Technologies product performance was driven primarily by our gastrointestinal product line.  
  Patient Monitoring   Recovery net sales for fiscal year 2016 were $4.3 billion. Net sales contributions in Patient Monitoring   Recovery were driven mainly by U.S. sales within Airways and Ventilation Management, Patient Monitoring, Patient Care, Nutritional Insufficiency, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Renal Care Solutions. Airways and Ventilation Management and Patient Monitoring performance was attributable to  airway products, acute ventilator sales, and sensors. Patient Care net sales results were primarily due to sales of incontinence, wound care and SharpSafety product lines and sales within our electrode products. The Nutritional Insufficiency and Deep Vein Thrombosis net sales were largely driven by sales of enteral feeding, and compression product lines. Renal Care Solutions results were primarily due to sales of dialysis products. 
  Looking ahead, we expect our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group could be affected by the following: 
             
    The planned divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Patient Monitoring   Recovery division. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was obtained in May 2017. Net sales of the businesses included in the planned divestiture were $2.4 billion in fiscal years 2017 and 2016.  
                
    Changes in procedural volumes, competitive and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic risks, reprocessing of our products, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, the timing of product registration approvals, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
                
    Continued acceptance and future growth of Open-to-Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) techniques and tools supported by our efforts to transition open surgery to MIS. The Open to MIS initiative focuses on establishing our presence in and working to optimize open surgery globally, while capturing the market opportunity that exists in transitioning open procedures to MIS, whether through traditional MIS, or advanced technologies including robotics. To achieve this transition, we are focused on product training, surgical skill training and continued therapy innovation to advance MIS. 
                
    Continued acceptance and future growth of the powered stapling and energy platform.  
                
    Our ability to execute ongoing strategies in order to address the competitive pressure of reprocessing of our vessel sealing disposables in the U.S. 
                
    Our ability to create markets and drive product and procedures into emerging markets.

    Expanding the use of less invasive treatments and furthering our commitment to improving options for women with abnormal uterine bleeding with our fiscal year 2017 acquisition of Smith and Nephew's gynecology business. The addition expands and strengthens the surgical offerings and complements the existing global gynecology business.   
      
  Restorative Therapies Group      
  The Restorative Therapies Group's products focus on various areas of the spine, bone graft substitutes, biologic products, trauma, implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), overactive bladder, urinary retention, fecal incontinence and gastroparesis, as well as products to treat conditions of the ear, nose, and throat, and systems that incorporate advanced energy surgical instruments. The Restorative Therapies Group also manufactures and sells image-guided surgery and intra-operative imaging systems and therapies to treat diseases of the vasculature in and around the brain including coils, neurovascular stents and flow diversion products. The Restorative Therapies Group s net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $7.4 billion  , an increase of   2 percent   as compared to fiscal year   2016  . Currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $1 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year. The Restorative Therapies Group's net sales were unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The Restorative Therapies Group s performance for fiscal year   2017   was driven by solid growth in Brain and Specialty Therapies, partially offset by declines in Pain Therapies. See the more detailed discussion of each division's performance below. 
  Spine net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $2.6 billion  , flat compared to fiscal year   2016  . Spine net sales were driven by growth in BMP due to strong U.S. sales, offset by declines in Europe due to the InductOs stop shipment due to suspension in the E.U. Core Spine had net sales growth in the U.S due to new product launches including the Solera Voyager and Elevate expandable cage in conjunction with the "Speed to Scale" initiative, which involves faster innovation cycles and launching a steady cadence of new products at scale with sets immediately available for the entire market, and growth in implants due to the success of our Surgical Synergy strategy, offset by market softness in Europe and the Middle East driven by the macro-economic conditions. InductOs returned to the European market in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
  Brain Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $2.1 billion  , an increase of   6 percent   as compared to fiscal year   2016  . The increase in net sales was driven by strong growth in both Neurovascular and Neurosurgery. Neurovascular net sales growth was driven by growth in coils from the Axium Prime Extra Soft detachable coil, growth in flow diversion from the Pipeline Flex embolization device, and growth in stents due to the Solitaire revascularization device, partially offset by declines due to a voluntary recall of certain product lines in the second quarter. Neurosurgery net sales growth was driven by strong sales of navigation capital equipment, disposables, and the O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. Despite competitive pressure, Brain Modulation drove net sales growth with U.S. sales of the MR Conditional Activa DBS portfolio and through updated Parkinson s Disease labeling for patients with Recent Onset of Motor Complications. 
  Specialty Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $1.5 billion  , an increase of   5 percent   as compared to fiscal year   2016  . The increase in net sales was driven by strong growth in Advanced Energy and Pelvic Health and growth in ENT.  Net sales growth in Advanced Energy was driven by the sales of the Aquamantys Transcollation and PEAK PlasmaBlade products. Net sales growth in Pelvic Health was driven by strong InterStim implant growth in the U.S. Net sales growth in ENT continues to benefit from strong adoption of new products, including NuVent balloons and Fusion Compact navigation.  
  Pain Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $1.1 billion  , a decrease of   4 percent   as compared to fiscal year   2016  . The decrease in net sales was driven by declines in sales of spinal cord stimulation products due to competitive pressures in the U.S., partially offset by growth in Interventional from the OsteoCool RF Spinal Tumor ablation system.

Spine net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $2.6 billion  , a decrease of   1 percent   compared to fiscal year   2015  . The decrease in Spine net sales was driven by declines in Core Spine partially offset by growth in BMP (composed of INFUSE bone graft (InductOs in the E.U.)) in the U.S. The U.S. Core Spine market grew in the low-single digits, with modest procedural growth offset by continued pricing pressures. During fiscal year 2016, new product introductions across several procedures resulted in a sequential improvement in the Core Spine growth rate. We saw incremental revenue from our differentiated OLIF procedures, as well as from the recent Solera, Voyager, Elevate, and PTC Interbody launches for TLIF and MIDLF procedures. In Core Spine, we are realized some early benefits from our "Speed to Scale" initiative, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the market. In BMP, strong growth in the U.S. was offset by declines in international BMP due to the InductOs stop shipment in Europe. 
  Brain Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $2.0 billion  , an increase of   34 percent   compared to fiscal year   2015  .  The growth rate reflected the addition of the Neurovascular division as a result of the Covidien acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year   2015  . Neurovascular contributed revenue from the strength of its coils, stents, flow diversion, and access product lines and the Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device delivered strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market. Additionally, our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, Pipeline Flex in the U.S. and Japan and Pipeline Shield in Europe, continued to lead the market. Neurosurgery contributed revenue from growth of the O-arm imaging systems. Growth in Neurovascular and Neurosurgery was partially offset by declines in DBS due to competitive headwinds.  
  Specialty Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $1.4 billion  , an increase of   6 percent   compared to fiscal year   2015  .  The increase in net sales was driven by continued worldwide net sales growth across the portfolio of Advanced Energy, Pelvic Health, and ENT. Performance was driven by strong growth of power systems, Aquamantys Transcollation, and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies, as well as solid implant growth of our InterStim therapy for overactive bladder, urinary retention, and bowel incontinence.  
  Pain Therapies net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $1.2 billion  , a decrease of   6 percent   compared to fiscal year   2015  . Net sales declined for Drug Pumps and Pain Stimulation. In Drug Pumps, the business was negatively affected by challenges related to its April 2015 U.S. FDA consent decree, as well as the January divestiture of its intrathecal baclofen drug. In Pain Stimulation, declines were driven by increased competition in the market. Interventional spine net sales also declined driven by continued pricing pressures.  
  Looking ahead, we expect our Restorative Therapies Group could be affected by the following:  
             
    Changes in procedural volumes, competitive and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic risks, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, the timing of product registration approvals, and fluctuations in  currency exchange rates. 
                
    Continued market acceptance of our new integrated solutions through the Surgical Synergy program, which integrates our spinal implants and imaging and navigation equipment. 
                
    Continued success of "Speed to Scale" program product launches, which involves faster innovation cycles and launching a steady cadence of new products at scale with sets immediately available for the entire market.  
                
    Market acceptance and continued global adoption of innovative new Spine products, such as our CD Horizon Solera Voyager system, our ELEVATE expandable interbody cages, and our OLIF25 and OLIF51 procedural solutions and the return of the InductOs products to European markets in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

  Diabetes Group      
  The Diabetes Group's products include insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, insulin pump consumables, and therapy management software. The Diabetes Group s net sales for fiscal year   2017   were   $1.9 billion  , an increase of   3   percent as compared to fiscal year 2016, and were unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year   2016  . Currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales for fiscal year   2017   of $13 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year.  The Diabetes Group's net sales for fiscal year   2017   benefited from growth in both the U.S. and international markets due to strong U.S. sales of the MiniMed 630G system and interest in the Priority Access Program for the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system, as well as strong international sales in Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific of the MiniMed 640G system with the Enhanced Enlite sensor.  
  The Diabetes Group s net sales for fiscal year   2016   were   $1.9 billion  , an increase of   6 percent   over fiscal year   2015  , and were favorably affected by the additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year   2016  . The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the MiniMed 530G system with Enlite sensor, along with strong performance in international markets by the MiniMed 640G. 
  Looking ahead, we expect our Diabetes Group could be affected by the following: 
             
    Competitive and pricing pressure, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, the timing of product registration approvals, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  
                
    Continued acceptance and growth in international markets of the MiniMed 630G system, which includes the insulin pump and Enlite CGM sensor. This system launched in the U.S. in August 2016 and combines proprietary SmartGuard technology featured in the MiniMed 530G system with a brand new hardware platform and user-friendly design.  
                
    Acceptance and future growth of the MiniMed 670G system, the first hybrid closed loop system in the world. The system features our most advanced SmartGuard HCL algorithm, which enables improved glucose control with reduced user input. The MiniMed 670G system received U.S. FDA approval during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and launched in the U.S. in June 2017.  
                
    Changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs, along with payor coverage of the MiniMed 670G system.  
                
    Continued acceptance and future growth of the MiniMed 640G with SmartGuard predictive low-glucose management, which has launched in Europe, Australia, and select Latin America countries, and the MiniMed 620G, the first integrated system customized for the Japanese market.  
                
    Continued acceptance and future growth of Guardian Connect continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system which displays information directly to a smartphone, and received CE mark in 2016 and has launched internationally, with an expected U.S. launch in the second half of fiscal year 2018.

OPERATIONS BY MARKET GEOGRAPHY 
  The charts below illustrate net sales by market geography for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  : 
  
  The table below illustrates net sales by market geography for each of our operating segments for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and 2015: 

(1) 
    U.S. includes the United States and U.S. territories 
              (2) 
    Non-U.S. developed markets include Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Canada, and the countries of Western Europe 
              (3) 
    Emerging markets include the countries of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the countries of Asia that are not included in the non-U.S. developed markets, as defined above 
     For fiscal year   2017  , net sales for the U.S. increased 1 percent, developed markets outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, and emerging markets increased 7 percent compared to fiscal year   2016  . Net sales growth across all markets was driven by meaningful product launches and introduction of groundbreaking new technologies, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Net sales growth in the U.S. was led by strong growth in the Cardiac and Vascular Group and Minimally Invasive Therapies Group and solid growth in the Restorative Therapies Group and Diabetes. In Emerging Markets, net sales growth was also attributable to the expansion of access to our therapies.  
  For fiscal year   2016  , net sales for the U.S increased 45 percent, non-U.S. developed markets increased 37 percent, and emerging markets increased 43 percent over fiscal year 2015. The growth in all markets was primarily driven by the addition of Minimally Invasive Therapies Group net sales totaling $9.6 billion for fiscal year 2016 and was also favorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Net sales growth in the U.S. was led by strong growth in the Cardiac and Vascular Group and solid growth in the Restorative Therapies Group and Diabetes. 
  Net sales in non-U.S. developed and emerging markets are accompanied by certain financial risks, such as changes in currency exchange rates and collection of receivables, which typically have longer payment terms. We monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. However, a significant amount of our outstanding  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

accounts receivable are with international customers. We continue to monitor the economic conditions and the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable from our international customers. Although we do not currently foresee a significant credit risk associated with a material portion of these receivables, repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of the countries we serve.  
   
  COSTS AND EXPENSES 
  Cost of Products Sold      

We continue to focus on reducing our costs of products sold, thus increasing gross profit, through supply chain management and changes to our manufacturing network. Gross margin percent was   68.7 percent  ,   68.3 percent  , and   68.9 percent   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. Gross margin percent in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 decreased as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2015 largely due to the  change in product mix as a result of the Covidien acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Gross margin percent changes in fiscal years   2017   and   2016   as compared to the same periods in the respective prior fiscal year were also affected by a $38 million charge during fiscal year   2017   related to the recognition of the fair value step-up of acquired Heartware inventory, as compared to a   $226 million   charge and   $623 million   charge during fiscal years   2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to the recognition of the fair value step-up of acquired Covidien inventory. 
  Research and Development   Selling, General, and Administrative Expense 
  The following is a summary of research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales: 

Research and Development     We remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs, that lead to enhanced quality of life, and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence. We are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare.  
  Research and development expense for both fiscal years   2017   and   2016   was   $2.2 billion  , as compared to   $1.6 billion   in fiscal year   2015  .  Research and development expense decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales over the three-year period due, in part, to the timing of clinical trials and product approvals. During fiscal year   2017  , we continued to invest in new technologies to support our mission through continued product growth.  
  Selling, General, and Administrative     Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives and to continue to realize cost synergies expected from our acquisitions. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consist of salaries and wages, as well as other administrative costs such as professional fees and marketing expenses.  
  Selling, general, and administrative expense was   $9.7 billion  ,   $9.5 billion  , and   $6.9 billion   during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expense remained fairly flat as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year   2016   to   2017  , with a slight decrease due to cost savings associated with selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives. We continue to execute on our cost synergies from the Covidien acquisition and transition to centers of excellence in our enabling functions.

Other Costs and Expenses 

Special Charge       During fiscal year   2017  , in continuing our commitment to improve the health of people and communities throughout the world, we made a   $100 million   charitable cash contribution to meet the multi-year funding needs of the Medtronic Foundation, a related party non-profit organization. 
  During fiscal year 2016, we recognized special charges of   $70 million   in connection with the impairment of a debt investment. 
  During fiscal year 2015, we recognized special gains of   $138 million  , which consisted of a   $41 million   gain on the sale of a product line in the ENT division and a   $97 million   gain on the sale of an equity method investment. These special gains were partially offset by a   $100 million   charitable contribution that we made to the Medtronic Foundation. 
  Restructuring Charges     We incur restructuring charges in connection with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives or with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations. Amounts recognized as restructuring charges result from a series of judgments and estimates about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on assumptions upon implementation of the initiative programs. 
  We began our restructuring program related to the acquisition of Covidien, the cost synergies initiative, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. We anticipate approximately $850 million in cost synergies to be achieved as a result of the Covidien acquisition through fiscal year 2018, including administrative office optimization, manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, and certain general and administrative savings. Restructuring charges are expected to be incurred in future fiscal years as cost synergy initiatives are finalized. Restructuring charges are expected to be primarily related to employee termination costs and costs related to manufacturing and facility closures. 
    
  Our restructuring reserve balances at   April 28, 2017  ,   April 29, 2016  , and   April 24, 2015   were   $291 million  ,   $250 million  , and   $143 million  , respectively. During fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , we recognized restructuring charges of   $441 million  ,   $332 million  , and   $248 million  , respectively. For fiscal year 2017, the restructuring charges included   $73 million   of incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages. For further discussion on the incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses, see Note   17   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  The restructuring charges during fiscal years   2017   and   2016   were partially offset by reversals of excess restructuring reserves of   $68 million   and   $18 million  , respectively. Reversals of restructuring reserves relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within the Company, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination costs being less than initially estimated. For fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , restructuring charges of $10 million, $9 million, and $15 million, respectively, were recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  For additional information, see Note   4   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Certain Litigation Charges     We classify litigation charges and gains related to significant legal proceedings as certain litigation charges. During the fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , we recognized   $300 million  ,   $26 million  , and   $42 million  , respectively, of certain litigation charges related to probable and estimable damages. 
  For additional information, see Note   20   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Acquisition-Related Items     During fiscal year   2017  , we recognized acquisition-related items expense of $230 million, including $10 million recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. Acquisition-related items expenses  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

primarily include integration-related expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition. The expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition include $225 million of professional services and integration expenses and $23 million of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense. Acquisition-related items expense also includes expenses incurred in connection with the HeartWare acquisition and planned divestiture of a portion of the Patient Monitoring and Recovery business, partially offset by the change in fair value of contingent consideration as a result of revised revenue forecasts and the timing of anticipated regulatory milestones.  
  During fiscal year 2016, we recognized acquisition-related items expense of $283 million, primarily related to expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition. The expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition include   $219 million   of professional services and integration expenses and   $58 million   of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense. 
  During fiscal year 2015, we recognized charges from acquisition-related items of $550 million, primarily related to expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition. The expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition include $275 million of professional services and integration expenses, $189 million of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense, and $69 million of incremental officer and director excise tax. 
   
  Amortization of Intangible Assets     Amortization of intangible assets     includes the amortization expense of our definite-lived intangible assets, consisting of purchased patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, and purchased technology.  Amortization expense was   $2.0 billion  ,   $1.9 billion  , and   $733 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. The increase in amortization expense from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 is primarily due to the acquisition of amortizable intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of HeartWare. The increase in amortization expense from fiscal year   2015   to fiscal year   2016   is primarily due to recognizing a full year of amortization of the intangible assets acquired with Covidien in the fourth quarter of fiscal year   2015  .  
  Other Expense, Net     Other expense, net includes royalty income and expense, realized equity security gains and losses, currency transaction and derivative gains and losses, impairment charges on equity securities, Puerto Rico excise tax, and U.S. medical device excise tax. In fiscal year   2017  , other expense, net was $  222 million   as compared to $  107 million   in fiscal year   2016  . The largest contributor to the change in other expense, net was a decrease in net currency gains, partially offset by the decrease in U.S. medical device tax due to the suspension of the U.S. medical device tax beginning January 1, 2016. Total net currency gains recognized in   other expense, net   were $81 million in fiscal year   2017   compared to gains of $314 million in fiscal year   2016  .    
  In fiscal year   2016  , other expense, net was $  107 million  , a decrease of $11 million from $  118 million   in fiscal year   2015  .  The largest contributor to the change in other expense, net     was was an increase in net currency gains, partially offset by increased royalty expense within Minimally Invasive Therapies Group.  Total net currency gains recognized in   other expense, net   were $314 million in fiscal year   2016   compared to gains of $196 million in fiscal year   2015  . 
  Interest Expense, Net     Interest expense, net includes interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, and ineffectiveness on interest rate derivative instruments. In fiscal year   2017  , interest expense, net was   $728 million   compared to   $955 million   in fiscal year   2016  . The decrease in interest expense, net for fiscal year   2017   was the result of a $183 million charge recorded in connection with the cash tender offer and redemption of certain debt securities in fiscal year   2016   and a $45 million loss on interest rate swaps which were entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that was no longer anticipated in fiscal year   2016  .  
  In fiscal year fiscal year   2016  , interest expense, net was   $955 million   compared to $  280 million   in fiscal year 2015.  The increase in interest expense, net for fiscal year   2016   was driven by an increase in total debt, primarily resulting from the Covidien acquisition, a   $183 million   charge recorded in connection with the cash tender offer and redemption of certain debt securities, and a   $45 million   loss on interest rate swaps which were entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that was no longer anticipated in fiscal year   2016  .

INCOME TAXES 

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 12.6 percent compared to 18.4 percent in fiscal year 2016. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was due to the net tax impact of inventory step-up, debt tender premium, certain litigation payments, certain tax adjustments, operational tax benefits described below, and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction. 
  Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2017 was 16.2 percent compared to 15.8 percent in fiscal year 2016. The increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to operational tax benefits and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction. 
  During fiscal year 2017, we recognized     $95 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $44 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses and a $51 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.  
  Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 18.4 percent compared to 23.3 percent in fiscal year 2015. The decrease in our effective tax rate was due to the net tax impact of inventory step-up, debt tender premium, acquisition-related items, certain tax adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, the impact from the acquisition of Covidien, operational tax benefits described below, and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction. 
  Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2016 was 15.8 percent compared to 18.2 percent in fiscal year 2015. The decrease in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the Covidien acquisition, operational tax benefits, and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction. 
  During fiscal year 2016, we recognized $97 million of operational tax benefits. The retroactive renewal and extension of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit resulted in a $16 million operational tax benefit for fiscal year 2016. In addition, we recognized a $40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses and a $41 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, and changes to uncertain tax position reserves. 
  An increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years   2017, 2016, and 2015 of approximately     $76 million, $74 million, and $58 million, respectively. 
  Certain Tax Adjustments     
  During fiscal year 2017, we recognized certain tax adjustments of $202 million, which included the following: 
             
    A charge of $404 million associated with the IRS resolution for the Ardian, CoreValve, Inc., Ablation Frontiers, Inc., PEAK Surgical, Inc. and Salient Surgical Technologies, Inc. acquisition-related issues and the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for certain businesses. This resolution does not include the businesses that are the subject of the Medtronic, Inc. U.S. Tax Court case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. 
                
    A net charge of $125 million associated with the expected divestiture of a portion of our Patient Monitoring   Recovery division to Cardinal Health.  The net charge primarily relates to the tax effect from the recognition of the outside basis difference of certain subsidiaries which are included in the expected divestiture.  
     
   55 

     Table of Contents  

A charge of $86 million associated with the IRS s disallowance of the utilization of certain net operating losses, along with the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net operating loss deferred tax asset, was recognized during the year.  
                
    A charge of $18 million as a result of the redemption of an intercompany minority interest during the year.   
                
    A benefit of $431 million as the result of the resolution of Covidien's previously disclosed Tyco International plc intercompany debt issues with the U.S. Tax Court and the Appeals Division of the IRS.  
     The $202 million net certain tax adjustment was recognized in   provision for income taxes   in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 2017. 
  During fiscal year 2016, we recognized certain tax adjustments of $417 million, which included the following: 
             
    A charge of $442 million primarily related to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from our completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy Covidien businesses that reduced the cash and investments held by our U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries (the Internal Reorganization). As a result of the Internal Reorganization, approximately $9.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities previously held by U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries became available for general corporate purposes.  
                
    A $25 million tax benefit associated with the disposition of a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary.  
     The $417 million net certain tax adjustment was recognized in   provision for income taxes   in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 2016. 
  During fiscal year 2015, we recognized certain tax adjustments of $349 million, which included the following: 
             
    A charge of $329 million related to the resolution of the Kyphon Inc. (Kyphon) acquisition-related issues with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  
                
    A charge of $20 million related to a taxable gain associated with the Covidien acquisition.  
     The $349 million certain tax adjustment was recognized in   provision for income taxes   in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 2015. 
  Certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods. Therefore, we consider these Non-GAAP Adjustments. Refer to the "Executive Level Overview" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further analysis related to these adjustments. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

(1) 
    The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, excluding current assets and current liabilities held for sale at April 28, 2017. 
     We believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility in the future. Approximately   $6 billion   of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by certain U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries may not represent available liquidity for general corporate purposes. However, we believe our other existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and related commercial paper program ($901 million outstanding at   April 28, 2017  ), will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs for at least the next 12 months, including repayment of current debt obligations. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements.  
  In March 2017, Medtronic Luxco issued two tranches of Senior Notes with an aggregate face value of $1.850 billion, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $1.850 billion, net of premiums, discounts, and issuance costs. The first tranche consisted of $1.0 billion of 1.700 percent Senior Notes due 2019. The second tranche consisted of $850 million of 3.350 percent Senior Notes due 2027. Concurrent with the offering by Medtronic Luxco, Medtronic, Inc. issued $150 million in principal amount of its 4.625 percent Senior Notes due 2045 (the Reopening Notes).  The Reopening Notes are a further issuance of, and form a single series

with, the $4.0 billion principal amount of the previously outstanding 4.625 percent Senior Notes due 2045. We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.  
  In April 2016, we completed a cash tender offer and redemption of   $2.7 billion   of senior notes for   $3.0 billion   of total consideration. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of   $163 million  , which included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in   interest expense   in the consolidated statement of income. In addition to the loss on debt extinguishment, we recognized   $20 million   of interest expense due to the acceleration of net losses on forward starting interest rate derivatives, which were terminated at the time of original debt issuances, relating to the portion of debt extinguished in the tender offer.

    Agency ratings are subject to change, and there may be no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings and/or maintain its current ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
       
  Standard   Poor's Ratings Services (S P) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at   April 28, 2017   were unchanged as compared to the ratings at   April 29, 2016  . We do not expect the S P and Moody's ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet and our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and related commercial paper program, discussed above and within the  Debt and Capital  section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. 
  We have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business. We believe our off-balance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 
  Note   20   to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to significant legal proceedings. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 
  We record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries (to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax); however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested. Our current plans do not foresee a need to repatriate funds that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations or meet currently anticipated liquidity and capital investment needs. However, we evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations, and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure, we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations 
  We have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Our debt securities include U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, debt funds, and auction rate securities. Some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand. Our auction rate security holdings continue to experience reduced liquidity due to low investor demand. Although our auction rate securities are currently illiquid and other securities could become illiquid, we believe we could liquidate a substantial amount of our portfolio without incurring a material impairment loss. 
  For fiscal year   2017  , the total other-than-temporary impairment losses on available-for-sale debt securities were not significant. Based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested, we believe we have recognized all necessary other-than-temporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell, before recovery of the amortized cost. However, at   April 28, 2017  , we have   $242 million   of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate current and non-current available-for-sale debt securities of   $8.7 billion  . If market conditions deteriorate, some of these holdings may experience other-than-temporary

impairment in the future which could adversely impact our financial results. Management is required to use estimates and assumptions in its valuation of our investments, which requires a high degree of judgment, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding fair value measurements. 
   
  Summary of Cash Flows 

Operating Activities     The $1.7 billion increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year   2017   as compared to fiscal year   2016   was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable collections, as well as a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest of $350 million and $132 million, respectively, and a $191 million payment in fiscal year   2016   related to the Covidien tax sharing agreement. The increase in cash from accounts receivable was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue. The decrease in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of payments made for the resolution of the Kyphon acquisition-related matters, as well as Covidien income tax extension payments in fiscal year   2016  . We did not make any significant tax audit settlement payments or significant extension payments in fiscal year   2017  .  The decrease in cash paid for interest was the result of less debt, on average, in fiscal year   2017   as compared to fiscal year   2016  .  
  The $316 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year   2016   as compared to fiscal year   2015   was primarily attributable to an increase in net income before depreciation and amortization, loss on debt extinguishment, and acquisition-related items of $2.1 billion and a decrease in certain litigation payments of $469 million, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for incomes taxes and interest of $747 million and $688 million, respectively. The increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of the settlement payments made for the resolution of the Kyphon acquisition-related matters, Covidien income tax extension payments, and the impacts from the full year of Covidien results. The increase in cash paid for interest was primarily the result of a full year of interest payments on the Senior Notes and Term Loan issued in fiscal year   2015   primarily to fund the Covidien acquisition as well as the interest payments on the outstanding debt assumed as part of the Covidien acquisition. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also higher due to the impact of a full year of operations post-Covidien acquisition. 
  Investing Activities    The $3.8 billion increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year   2017   as compared to fiscal year   2016   was primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from purchases and sales and maturities of investments in fiscal year   2017  . 
  The $19.3 billion increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year   2016   as compared to fiscal year   2015   was primarily attributable to the Covidien acquisition in fiscal year   2015  , as well as an increase in the net proceeds from purchases and sales of investments in fiscal year   2016  . 
  Financing Activities       The $6.3 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year   2017   as compared to fiscal year   2016   was primarily attributable to the issuance of $2.0 billion of Senior Notes, an increase in commercial paper borrowings, and lower payments on maturing and extinguished debt, partially offset by increases in dividends to shareholders and repurchases of ordinary shares.  
  The $25.4 billion increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year   2016   as compared to fiscal year   2015   was primarily attributable to higher issuances of debt in fiscal year   2015  , primarily related to the Covidien acquisition. Further contributing to the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 were higher payments on maturing and extinguished debt, increased dividends to shareholders, and increased repurchases of ordinary shares. 
  Free Cash Flow  
  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our  
  
   58 

     Table of Contents  

reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows: 

Debt and Capital 
  Our capital structure consists of equity and interest-bearing debt. We use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our short-term financing needs. Current debt, including the current portion of our long-term debt and capital lease obligations, at   April 28, 2017   was   $7.5 billion   compared to   $993 million   at   April 29, 2016  . We utilize Senior Notes to meet our long-term financing needs. Long-term debt at   April 28, 2017   was   $25.9 billion   compared to   $30.1 billion   at   April 29, 2016  .  
  Total debt at   April 28, 2017   was   $33.4 billion  , compared to   $31.1 billion   at   April 29, 2016  . The increase in total debt was primarily driven by the issuance of three tranches of the 2017 Senior Notes with an aggregate face value of $2.0 billion in March 2017. We will use these funds for general corporate purposes.       
  We maintain a commercial paper program for short-term financing, which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.5 billion. At   April 28, 2017  , we had   $901 million   of commercial paper outstanding. No amount of commercial paper was outstanding under this program at   April 29, 2016  . During fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately   39   and   49   days, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate was   0.89 percent   and   0.57 percent  , respectively. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit, as explained below. 
  We also have a $3.5 billion syndicated line of credit facility ($3.5 Billion Revolving Credit Facility) which expires in January 2020. The $3.5 Billion Revolving Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The $3.5 Billion Revolving Credit Facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional $500 million at any time during the term of the agreement. At each anniversary date of the $3.5 Billion Revolving Credit Facility, but not more than twice prior to the maturity date, we could also request a   one  -year extension of the maturity date. At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , no amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit. 
  Interest rates on advances on our $3.5 Billion Revolving Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix, based on our long-term debt ratings assigned by S P and Moody s. For additional information on our credit ratings status by S P and Moody's refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. The agreements also contain customary covenants, all of which we remain in compliance with at   April 28, 2017  . 
  Interest-bearing debt as a percentage of total interest-bearing debt and equity was   40 percent   at   April 28, 2017   and   37 percent   at   April 29, 2016  . For further discussion on debt, see the  Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis. The indentures under which the Senior Notes have been issued contain customary covenants, all of which we remain in compliance with at   April 28, 2017  .

We repurchase shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In January 2015, our Board of Directors authorized, subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves, the adoption of the existing Medtronic Inc. share redemption program. At   April 29, 2016  , we had used all of the   80 million   shares authorized under the January 2015 share redemption program. In June 2015, our Board of Directors authorized, subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves, the redemption of an additional   80 million   of our ordinary shares. At   April 29, 2016  , we had used 8 million of the 80 million shares authorized under the June 2015 share redemption program. During fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , we repurchased a total of   43 million   and   38 million   shares, respectively, under these programs at an average price of   $83.03   and   $74.92  , respectively. At   April 28, 2017  , we had approximately   29 million   shares remaining under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors.  In June 2017, our Board of Directors replaced the existing June 2015 authorization to redeem up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares with an authorization to expend up to an aggregate amount of   $5 billion   beginning June 26, 2017 to redeem ordinary shares.

  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
  Presented below is a summary of our off-balance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at   April 28, 2017  , as well as long-term contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at   April 28, 2017  .  
  We acquire assets still in development, enter into research and development arrangements, and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone and/or royalty payments to a third-party, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. In situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment, we have included the milestone or minimum royalty payments in the table below. The majority of the arrangements give us the discretion to unilaterally make the decision to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments. Due to the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations.  
  In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. Our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions are unable to be estimated, and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table below. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS 
  This Annual Report, and other written reports and oral statements made by or with the approval of one of the Company s executive officers from time to time, may include  forward-looking  statements. Forward-looking statements broadly include our current expectations or forecasts of future results. Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our growth and growth strategies, developments in the markets for our products, therapies and services, financial results, product development launches and effectiveness, research and development strategy, regulatory approvals, competitive strengths, restructuring and cost-saving initiatives, intellectual property rights, litigation and tax matters, government investigations, mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, market acceptance of our products, therapies and services, accounting estimates, financing activities, ongoing contractual obligations, working capital adequacy, value of our investments, our effective tax rate, our expected returns to shareholders, and sales efforts. Such statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   intend,   looking ahead,   may,   plan,   possible,   potential,   project,   should,   will,  and similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our ability to drive long-term shareholder value, development and future launches of products and continued or future acceptance of products, therapies and services in our operating segments; expected timing for completion of research studies relating to our products; market positioning and performance of our products, including stabilization of certain product markets; divestitures and the potential benefits thereof; the costs and benefits of integrating previous acquisitions; anticipated timing for U.S. FDA and non-U.S. regulatory approval of new products; increased presence in new markets, including markets outside the U.S.; changes in the market and our market share; acquisitions and investment initiatives, as well as integration of acquired companies into our operations; the resolution of tax matters; the effectiveness of our development activities in reducing patient care costs and hospital stay lengths; our approach towards cost containment; our expectations regarding health care costs, including potential changes to reimbursement policies and pricing pressures; our expectations regarding changes to patient standards of care; our ability to identify and maintain successful business partnerships; the elimination of certain positions or costs related to restructuring initiatives; outcomes in our litigation matters and government investigations; general economic conditions; the adequacy of available working capital and our working capital needs; our payment of dividends and redemption of shares; the continued strength of our balance sheet and liquidity; our accounts receivable exposure; and the potential impact of our compliance with governmental regulations and accounting guidance. One must carefully consider forward-looking statements and understand that such statements may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and may involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed in the sections entitled  Government Regulation and Other Considerations  within  Item 1. Business  and  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those related to competition in the medical device industry, reduction or interruption in our supply, quality problems, liquidity shortfalls, decreasing prices and pricing pressure, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in applicable tax rates, positions taken by taxing authorities, adverse regulatory action, delays in regulatory approvals, litigation results, self-insurance, commercial insurance, health care policy changes, international operations, failure to complete or achieve the intended benefits of acquisitions or divestitures, or disruption of our current plans and operations.  
  Consequently, no forward-looking statement may be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially. We intend to take advantage of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding our forward-looking statements, and are including this sentence for the express purpose of enabling us to use the protections of the safe harbor with respect to all forward-looking statements. 
  We undertake no obligation to update any statement we make, but investors are advised to consult all other disclosures by us in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results. In addition, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated due to a number of factors, including, among others, those discussed in the section entitled  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. As such, investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties, or potentially inaccurate assumptions.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK 
  Due to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes. In periods in which the U.S. dollar, our functional currency, is strengthening/weakening as compared to other currencies, our revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities denominated in other currencies may be translated into U.S. dollars at a lower/higher value than they would be in an otherwise constant currency exchange rate environment. 
  We use operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the Euro and Japanese Yen. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes. 
  The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016   was   $10.8 billion  . At   April 28, 2017  , these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of $118 million. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at   April 28, 2017   indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase/decrease by approximately $836 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.  
  INTEREST RATE RISK 
  We are subject to interest rate risk on our short-term investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at   April 28, 2017   was comprised of debt predominately denominated in U.S. dollars, of which approximately 85% is fixed rate debt and approximately 15% is floating-rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities, fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, and forward starting interest rate swap agreements.  
  A sensitivity analysis of the impact on our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates, compared to interest rates at   April 28, 2017  , indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by $67 million. 
  For a discussion of current market conditions and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, please see the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
    
  To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Medtronic plc: 
    
  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Medtronic plc and its subsidiaries (the Company) at April 28, 2017 and April 29, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 28, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1)       presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2017, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated     audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1  .   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Nature of Operations     Medtronic plc (Medtronic or the Company) is a global leader in medical technology   alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. The Company provides innovative products and therapies to serve hospitals, physicians, clinicians, and patients. Medtronic was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.  
  Principles of Consolidation     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medtronic plc, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been fully eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year.  
  In connection with the preparation of the Form 10-K for the year ended   April 28, 2017  , the Company revised its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of equity to properly present additional paid-in capital separate from retained earnings for the prior periods. The revision, which the Company determined is not material, had no impact on total equity, results of operations, or cash flows.   
  Use of Estimates     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting for items such as  income taxes, contingencies, and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. 
  Fiscal Year-End     The Company utilizes a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending the last Friday in April, for the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016   and for each of the three fiscal years ended   April 28, 2017   (fiscal year   2017  ),   April 29, 2016   (fiscal year   2016  ), and   April 24, 2015   (fiscal year   2015  ). Fiscal years   2017   and   2015   were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year, with the additional week occurring in the first quarter.  
  Cash Equivalents     The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 
  Investments     Investments in marketable equity securities and certain debt securities, which include corporate debt securities, government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, debt funds, and auction rate securities, are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value for available-for-sale securities is recorded, net of taxes, as a component of   accumulated other comprehensive loss   on the consolidated balance sheets. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. The classification of marketable securities as current or long-term is based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations consistent with how the Company manages its capital structure and liquidity.  
  Investments in securities that are classified and accounted for as trading securities primarily include exchange-traded funds and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Management has used trading securities when seeking to offset changes in liabilities related to equity and other market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. 
  Certain of the Company s investments in equity and other securities are long-term, strategic investments in companies that are in varied stages of development. These investments are included in   other assets   on the consolidated balance sheets. If an investment has no quoted market price, the Company accounts for these investments under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. Certain of these investments are publicly traded companies and are therefore accounted for as available-for-sale. The valuation of equity and other securities accounted for under the cost method considers all available financial information related to the investee, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. If an unrealized loss for any investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the determination is made. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company s investment and are adjusted each period for the Company s share of the investee s income or loss and dividends paid. Equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity methods are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company s investment may not be recoverable. See Note   6   for discussion of the gains and losses recognized on equity and other securities. 
  Inventories     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories for those items that are potentially excess, obsolete or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments or other economic factors.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Property, Plant, and Equipment     Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment asset groupings may not be recoverable. The company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the various assets. The cost of interest that is incurred in connection with ongoing construction projects is capitalized using a weighted average interest rate. These costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and amortized over the useful life of the related asset.  
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets    Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value is determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis. 
  Intangible assets include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and in-process research and development (IPR D). Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives ranging from   three   to   20 years  . Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis. 
  Acquired IPR D represents the fair value assigned to those research and development (R D) projects in development that were acquired in a business combination for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use.  
  IPR D is capitalized at its fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and any development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The fair value of IPR D is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each R D project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. Upon achieving regulatory approval or commercial viability for the related technology or product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related technology or product. If the R D project is not completed or the related R D project is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment related to the IPR D which is charged to expense.  
  Contingent Consideration     The Company recognizes contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred, estimated as the probability-weighted future cash flows, discounted back to present value. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, recognized as income or expense within   acquisition-related items   in the consolidated statements of income.  
  Derivatives        The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging, and presents assets and liabilities associated with its derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. See Note   9   for more information on the Company's derivative instruments and hedging programs.

Fair Value Measurements     The Company follows the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability, based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows: 
             
    Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
                
    Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. 
     Financial assets that are classified as Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds within U.S. government and agency securities and marketable equity securities for which quoted market prices are available. In addition, the Company classifies currency forward contracts as Level 1 since they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets which have identical assets or liabilities. 
  The valuation for most fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2. Financial assets that are classified as Level 2 include corporate debt securities, government and agency securities, other asset-backed securities, debt funds, and mortgage-backed securities whose value is determined using inputs that are observable in the market or may be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data such as pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, cash flow models with yield curves, and benchmark securities. In addition, interest rate swaps are included in Level 2 as the Company uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis. 
  Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Financial assets that are classified as Level 3 financial assets include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation, certain corporate debt securities and auction rate securities. With the exception of auction rate securities, these securities are valued using third-party pricing sources that incorporate transaction details such as contractual terms, maturity, timing, and amount of expected future cash flows, as well as assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation adjustments by market participants. The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated by the Company using a discounted cash flow model, which incorporates significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s auction rate securities are years to principal recovery and the illiquidity premium that is incorporated into the discount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value of the securities. 
  Certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient include certain debt funds, equity and fixed income commingled trusts, and registered investment companies. 
  Warranty Obligation     The Company offers a warranty on various products. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product is sold. The amount of the reserve recorded is equal to the net costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the obligation. The Company includes the warranty obligation in   other accrued expenses   and   other long-term liabilities   on the consolidated balance sheets.  
  Self-Insurance     It is the Company s policy to self-insure the majority of its insurable risks including medical and dental costs, disability coverage, physical loss to property, business interruptions, workers  compensation, comprehensive general, and product liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for those risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company uses claims data and historical experience, as applicable, to estimate liabilities associated with the exposures that the Company has self-insured. Based on historical loss trends, the Company believes that its self-insurance program accruals and its existing insurance coverage  
  
   72 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

are adequate to cover future losses. Historical trends, however, may not be indicative of future losses. These losses could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions     The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. See Note   17   for assumptions used in determining pension and post-retirement benefit costs.  
  The Company changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the Company s pension and other post-retirement benefits, effective April 30, 2016. Prior to April 30, 2016, the Company estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the market-observed yield curves of high-quality fixed income securities used to measure the pension benefit obligation and accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. The current methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company s pension obligation or accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. The Company accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. 
  Revenue Recognition     The Company sells its products through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. The Company recognizes revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfers to customers, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on the contract terms or legal requirements, provided there are no material remaining performance obligations required of the Company or any matters requiring customer acceptance. In cases where the Company utilizes distributors or ships product directly to the end user, revenue is recognized upon shipment provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met. A portion of the Company s revenue is generated from inventory maintained at hospitals or with field representatives. For these products, revenue is recognized at the time the product has been used or implanted.  
  The Company recognizes estimated sales returns, discounts, and rebates as a reduction of sales in the same period revenue is recognized. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. The Company adjusts reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and records such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. 
  In certain circumstances, the Company enters into arrangements in which multiple deliverables are provided to customers. Under multiple deliverable arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the principles described above and allocates the revenue based on the relative selling price of each deliverable, which is based on vendor specific objective evidence.  
  Shipping and Handling     Shipping and handling costs not included in   cost of products sold   are included in   selling, general, and administrative expense   in the consolidated statements of income and were   $370 million  ,   $316 million  , and   $284 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
  Research and Development     Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs include costs of all basic research activities as well as other research, engineering, and technical effort required to develop a new product or service or make significant improvement to an existing product or manufacturing process. Research and development costs also include pre-approval regulatory and clinical trial expenses. 
  Contingencies    The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. Insurance recoveries related to potential claims are recognized up to the amount of the recorded liability when coverage is confirmed and the estimated recoveries are probable of payment. These recoveries are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Income Taxes    The Company has deferred taxes that arise because of the different treatment of transactions for financial statement accounting and income tax accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense has already been taken as a deduction on the Company s tax return but has not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income.  
  Other Expense, Net       Other expense, net   includes royalty income and expense, realized equity security gains and losses, currency transaction and derivative gains and losses, impairment charges on equity securities, Puerto Rico excise tax, and U.S. medical device excise tax. 
  Currency Translation     Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the currency impacts arising from the translation of  the assets and liabilities are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment, a component of   accumulated other comprehensive loss   on the consolidated balance sheets. Elements of the consolidated statements of income are translated at the average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in   other expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income. 
  Stock-Based Compensation     The Company measures stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods. The total expense recognized over the vesting period equals the fair value of awards that vest. 
  New Accounting Standards 
  Recently Adopted 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance that requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability. Prior to this amendment, debt issuance costs were recognized as an asset in the balance sheet and did not offset the related debt liability. The Company retrospectively adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Its adoption resulted in a reduction of both assets and liabilities of   $138 million   on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at   April 29, 2016   as previously filed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   April 29, 2016  . 
  Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued amended revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and may be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). Early adoption is permitted. The Company intends to adopt this guidance under the modified retrospective method. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the guidance and will continue to monitor any modifications, clarifications, and interpretations communicated by the FASB. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The guidance also includes a simplified impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values and presentation and disclosure changes. This accounting guidance is required for the Company to adopt beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company is unable to estimate the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements as it will depend on the equity investments at the adoption date.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative  
  
   74 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

period in the financial statements and is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the lease guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and anticipates recording additional assets and corresponding liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet related to operating leases within its lease portfolio upon adoption of the guidance.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for share based payment transactions by requiring all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in income tax expense or benefit in earnings; eliminating the requirement to classify the excess tax benefits and deficiencies as additional paid-in capital. Under the new guidance, an entity makes an accounting policy election to either estimate the expected forfeiture awards or account for forfeitures as they occur. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company recognized excess tax benefits of   $92 million  ,   $82 million   and   $81 million   in excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires the tax effect of inter-entity transactions, other than sales of inventory, to be recognized when the transaction occurs. This would eliminate the exception under the current guidance in which the tax effects of inter-entity asset transactions are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. This accounting guidance is required for the Company to adopt beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
   
  2  .   Acquisitions and Acquisition-Related Items    
  The Company had various acquisitions and other acquisition-related activity during fiscal year   2017  . The Company accounted for the acquisitions noted below as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. In accordance with authoritative guidance on business combination accounting, the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were recorded and consolidated on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to future yet to be defined technologies, new customer relationships, existing workforce of the acquired businesses, and synergies expected to arise after the Company's acquisition of these businesses. The pro forma impact of these acquisitions was not significant, either individually or in the aggregate, to the results of the Company for fiscal year   2017  . The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in the Company s consolidated statements of income since the date each business was acquired. 
  The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquisitions during fiscal year   2017   are as follows: 

HeartWare International, Inc. 
    
  On August 23, 2016, the Company's Cardiac and Vascular Group acquired HeartWare International, Inc. (HeartWare), a medical device company that develops and manufactures miniaturized implantable heart pumps, or ventricular assist devices, to treat patients around the world suffering from advanced heart failure. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately   $1.1 billion  . Based upon a preliminary acquisition valuation, the Company acquired   $602 million   of technology-based and customer-related intangible assets and   $23 million   of tradenames, with estimated useful lives of   15   and   5   years, respectively, and   $427  
  
   75 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

million   of goodwill. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company acquired   $245 million   of debt through the acquisition, of which the Company redeemed   $203 million   as part of a cash tender offer in August 2016. The remaining   $42 million   of debt acquired is due December 2017 and is recorded within   current debt obligations   on the consolidated balance sheets. The allocation of consideration is considered preliminary, primarily with respect to certain contingencies. The Company expects to finalize the allocation of purchase price within the one-year measurement period. Sales attributable to HeartWare were   $155 million   for fiscal year   2017  . 
    
  Smith   Nephew's Gynecology Business 
    
  On August 5, 2016, the Company's Minimally Invasive Therapies Group acquired Smith   Nephew's gynecology business, which expands and strengthens Medtronic's minimally invasive surgical offerings and further complements its existing global gynecology business. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately   $350 million  . The Company acquired   $167 million   of customer-related and technology-related intangible assets with useful lives of   13   years and   $180 million   of goodwill. The acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Sales attributable to Smith   Nephew's gynecology business were   $45 million   for fiscal year   2017  . 
    
  For information on the Company's fiscal year 2016 acquisitions, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 29, 2016  . 
  Acquisition-Related Items 
  During fiscal year   2017  , the Company recognized acquisition-related items expense of   $230 million  , including   $10 million   recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income, primarily related to integration-related expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition. The expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition include   $225 million   of professional services and integration expenses and   $23 million   of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense. Acquisition-related items expense also includes expenses incurred in connection with the HeartWare acquisition and planned divestiture of a portion of the Patient Monitoring and Recovery business, partially offset by the change in fair value of contingent consideration as a result of revised revenue forecasts and the timing of anticipated regulatory milestones. 
  During fiscal year   2016  , the Company recognized acquisition-related items expense of   $283 million  , primarily related to expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition. The expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition include   $219 million   of professional services and integration expenses and   $58 million   of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense. 
  During fiscal year 2015, the Company recognized acquisition-related items expense of   $550 million  , primarily related to expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition. The expenses incurred in connection with the Covidien acquisition include   $275 million   of professional services and integration expenses,   $189 million   of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense, and   $69 million   of incremental officer and director excise tax.  
  Contingent Consideration 
  Certain of the Company s business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. A liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value is recognized within   acquisition-related items   in the consolidated statements of income. Contingent consideration payments related to the acquisition date fair value are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Amounts paid in excess of the original acquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  
  The fair value of contingent consideration is measured using projected payment dates, discount rates, probabilities of payment, and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected revenues are based on the Company s most recent internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans. Changes in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates, and projected payment dates may result in adjustments to the fair value measurements. The recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of contingent consideration include the following significant unobservable inputs:  
  
   76 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The fair value of contingent consideration at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016   was   $246 million   and   $377 million  , respectively. At   April 28, 2017  ,   $180 million   was reflected in   other liabilities   and   $66 million   was reflected in   other accrued expenses   in the consolidated balance sheets. At   April 29, 2016  ,   $311 million   was reflected in   other liabilities   and   $66 million   was reflected in   other accrued expenses   in the consolidated balance sheets.  
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of contingent consideration: 

3  .   Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale    
  In April 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. As a result, the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at   April 28, 2017  , which requires the Company to present the related assets and liabilities as separate line items in our consolidated balance sheet.  
  The following table presents information related to the assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet: 

There were   no   assets or liabilities classified as held for sale at   April 29, 2016  . The Company determined that the divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.

4  .   Restructuring Charges    
  Cost Synergies Initiative 
  The cost synergies initiative is the Company's restructuring program primarily related to the integration of Covidien. This initiative is expected to contribute to the approximately   $850 million   in cost synergies expected to be achieved as a result of the integration of the Covidien acquisition through fiscal year 2018, including administrative office optimization, manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, certain program cancellations, and reduction of general and administrative redundancies. Restructuring charges are primarily related to employee termination costs and costs related to manufacturing and facility closures and affect all reportable segments. Cash outlays for the cost synergies initiative restructuring program are scheduled to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2019. 
    
  A summary of the restructuring accrual, recorded within   other accrued expenses   and   other liabilities   in the consolidated balance sheets, and related activity is presented below: 

As part of the cost synergies initiative, for fiscal year   2017  , the Company recognized   $441 million   in charges, which included   $73 million   of incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages. These costs are not included in the table summarizing the restructuring costs above, because they are associated with costs that are accounted for under the pension and post-retirement rules. See Note   17   for further discussion on the incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses. The charges recognized during fiscal year   2017   were partially offset by reversals of excess restructuring reserves of   $68 million  . Reversals of restructuring reserves relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within the Company, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination costs being less than initially estimated. Fiscal year   2017   asset write-downs included   $17 million   of property, plant, and equipment impairments. Fiscal year   2017   asset write-downs also included   $10 million   of inventory write-offs of discontinued product lines recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. 
  As part of the cost synergies initiative, for fiscal year   2016  , the Company recognized   $332 million   in charges, which were partially offset by reversals of excess restructuring reserves of   $18 million  . Reversals of restructuring reserves relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within the Company and revisions to severance provisions. Fiscal year   2016   asset write-downs included   $14 million   related to property, plant, and equipment impairments. Fiscal  year   2016   asset write-downs also inclued   $9 million   of inventory write-offs of discontinued product lines recognized within   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income. 
   
  5  .   Special Charge     
  During fiscal year   2017  , in continuing the Company's commitment to improve the health of people and communities throughout the world, the Company recognized a special charge of   $100 million   for a charitable contribution to meet the multi-year funding needs of the Medtronic Foundation, a related party non-profit organization. 
  During fiscal year   2016  , the Company recognized a special charge of   $70 million   in connection with the impairment of a debt investment.

During fiscal year   2015  , the Company recognized special gains of   $138 million  , which consisted of a   $41 million   gain on the sale of a product line in the ENT division, and a   $97 million   gain on the sale of an equity method investment. These special gains were partially offset by a   $100 million   charitable contribution that the Company made to the Medtronic Foundation. 
   
  6  .   Financial Instruments    
  The Company holds investments  such as marketable debt and equity securities that are classified and accounted for as trading and available-for-sale and are remeasured on a recurring basis. The Company also holds cost method, equity method, and other investments which are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  Refer to Note 1 for information regarding valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements. 
    
  In accordance with authoritative guidance adopted in fiscal year   2017  , certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are not presented within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented for these investments are intended to permit reconciliation to the consolidated balance sheets. The revised presentation has been applied retrospectively and fiscal year   2016   values have been reclassified to conform to classifications used in the current year.

Marketable Debt and Equity Securities: 
  The following tables present the gross unrealized losses and fair values of the Company s available-for-sale securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position deemed to be temporary, aggregated by investment category at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  :

The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurs. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during fiscal years   2017   or   2016  . When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

The following tables provide a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of items measured at fair value on a recurring basis that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

Activity related to the Company s investment portfolio is as follows:   

           (1) 
    Includes available-for-sale debt securities. 
              (2) 
    Includes marketable equity securities, cost method, equity method, exchange-traded funds, and other investments. 
              (3) 
    As a result of certain acquisitions that occurred during fiscal year   2017  , the Company recognized a non-cash realized gain of   $20 million   on its previously-held minority investment included in   other expense, net   in the consolidated statement of income.  
              (4) 
    As a result of certain acquisitions that occurred during fiscal year   2016  , the Company recognized a non-cash realized gain of   $9 million   on its previously-held minority investment included in   other expense, net   in the consolidated statement of income.  
              (5) 
    As a result of certain acquisitions that occurred during fiscal year   2015  , the Company recognized a non-cash realized gain of   $41 million   on its previously-held minority investments included in   other expense, net   in the consolidated statement of income. Also, a realized gain on an equity method investment totaling   $97 million   is included in   special charge (gain), net   in the consolidated statement of income. 
     Credit losses represent the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected on certain mortgage-backed securities and auction rate securities and the amortized cost of these securities. Based on the Company s assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which the Company is invested, the Company believes it has recognized all necessary other-than-temporary impairments as the Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, before recovery of the amortized cost.  
  At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , the credit loss portion of other-than temporary impairments on debt securities was   no  t significant. The total reductions for available-for-sale debt securities sold during fiscal years   2017   and   2016     were   no  t significant.  
  The   April 28, 2017   balance of available-for-sale debt securities, excluding debt funds which have no single maturity date, by contractual maturity is shown in the following table. Within the table, maturities of mortgage-backed securities have been allocated based upon timing of estimated cash flows assuming no change in the current interest rate environment. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities, because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

The Company holds investments in marketable equity securities, which are classified as   other assets   in the consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate carrying amount of these investments was $  103 million   and   $85 million   at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. The Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges related to marketable equity securities during fiscal year   2017  . During the fiscal years   2016   and   2015   the Company determined that the fair value of certain marketable equity securities were below their carrying values and that the carrying values of these investments were not expected to be recoverable within a reasonable period of time. As a result, the Company recognized   $20 million   and   $7 million   in impairment charges for fiscal years   2016    and   2015    respectively, which were recognized within   other expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income. 
  Cost method, equity method, and other investments 
  The Company holds investments in equity and other securities that are accounted for using the cost or equity method, which are classified as   other assets   in the consolidated balance sheets. At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , the aggregate carrying amount of equity and other securities without a quoted market price and accounted for using the cost or equity method was $  589 million   and   $506 million  , respectively. Cost and equity method investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company s investment may not be recoverable are assessed quarterly. If there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, the investment is assessed for impairment.  
  Cost and equity method investments fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value, as the investments are in privately-held entities without quoted market prices. To determine the fair value of these investments, the Company uses all pertinent financial information available related to the entities, including financial statements and market participant valuations from recent and proposed equity offerings. During the fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015   the Company determined that the fair values of certain cost and/or equity method investments were below their carrying values and that the carrying values of these investments were not expected to be recoverable within a reasonable period of time. As a result, the Company recognized $  30 million   of impairment charges during fiscal year   2017  , which were recognized in   other expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income  .   During fiscal year   2016  , the Company recognized   $23 million   of impairment charges, which were recognized in   other expense, net   and   $70 million   of impairment charges which were recognized in   special charge (gain), net   in the consolidated statements of income. During fiscal year   2015   the Company recognized   $7 million   of impairment charges, which were recognized in   other expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income  .

7  .   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    
  Goodwill 
  The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment:  

The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. There were no changes in reporting units during fiscal year   2017  . The test for impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The Company calculated the excess of each reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount, including goodwill, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. The Company did   no  t recognize any goodwill impairments during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  . 
  Intangible Assets 
  The following table presents the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets: 

The Company assesses definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable, the Company calculates the excess of an intangible asset's carrying value over its undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The inputs used in the fair value analysis fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. The Company did   no  t recognize any definite-lived intangible asset impairments during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  .  
  The Company assesses indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. The Company calculates the excess of

indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values over their carrying values utilizing a discounted future cash flow analysis. The Company did   no  t recognize any significant indefinite-lived asset impairments during fiscal years   2017   and   2016  . As a result of the analysis performed during fiscal year   2015  , the fair value of certain IPR D indefinite-lived assets were deemed to be less than their carrying value, resulting in an impairment loss of   $5 million  , which was recognized in   acquisition-related items   in the consolidated statements of income. Due to the nature of IPR D projects, the Company may experience future delays or failures to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, failures of such clinical trials, delays or failures to obtain required market clearances or other failures to achieve a commercially viable product, and as a result, may recognize impairment losses in the future.  
  Amortization 
  Intangible asset amortization expense for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015   was   $2.0 billion  ,   $1.9 billion  , and   $733 million  , respectively. Estimated aggregate amortization expense by fiscal year based on the current carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets at   April 28, 2017  , excluding any possible future amortization associated with acquired IPR D which has not met technological feasibility and amortization associated with definite-lived intangible assets classified as held for sale at   April 28, 2017  , is as follows: 

8  .   Financing Arrangements    
  Current debt obligations consisted of the following:   

  Commercial Paper    On January 26, 2015, Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A. (Medtronic Luxco), an entity organized under the laws of Luxembourg, entered into various agreements pursuant to which Medtronic Luxco may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the 2015 Commercial Paper Program) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of   $3.5 billion  . The Company and Medtronic, Inc. have guaranteed the obligations of Medtronic Luxco under the 2015 Commercial Paper Program. At   April 28, 2017  , the Company had   $901 million   of commercial paper outstanding.   No   amount of commercial paper was outstanding at   April 29, 2016  . 
    
  During fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately   39 days   and   49 days  , respectively, and the weighted average interest rate was   0.89 percent   and   0.57 percent  , respectively. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under the Company's existing line of credit.

Bank Borrowings     Outstanding bank borrowings at   April 28, 2017   were short-term advances to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries under credit agreements with various banks. Bank borrowings consist primarily of borrowings in Japanese Yen at interest rates ranging from   0.17%   to   0.18%  , and the borrowing is a natural hedge of currency and exchange rate risk.  
  Line of Credit     The Company has a   $3.5 billion     five   year revolving syndicated line of credit facility (  $3.5   Billion Revolving Credit Facility), by and among Medtronic, Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic Luxco, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and issuing bank, which expires in January 2020. The   $3.5   Billion Revolving Credit Facility provides the Company with the ability to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional   $500 million   at any time during the term of the agreement. At each anniversary date of the   $3.5   Billion Revolving Credit Facility, but not more than twice prior to the maturity date, the Company could also request a   one  -year extension of the maturity date. The Company, Medtronic Luxco, and Medtronic, Inc. guarantee the obligations under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  ,   no   amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit. 
  Interest rates on advances on the Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix, based on the Company s long-term debt ratings, assigned by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services and Moody s Investors Service. Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. The agreements also contain customary covenants, all of which the Company remained in compliance with at   April 28, 2017  .

Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

Senior Notes     The Company had outstanding unsecured senior obligations, including those described as senior notes in the long-term debt table above (collectively, the Senior Notes). The Senior Notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indentures under which the Senior Notes were issued contain customary covenants, all of which the Company remained in compliance with at   April 28, 2017  . The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes primarily for general corporate purposes, which includes the repayment of other indebtedness of the Company.

In March 2017, Medtronic Luxco issued   two   tranches of Senior Notes with an aggregate face value of   $1.850 billion   (collectively, the   2017 Senior Notes  ). The first tranche consisted of   $1.0 billion   of   1.700 percent   Senior Notes due 2019. The second tranche consisted of   $850 million   of   3.350 percent   Senior Notes due 2027. Concurrent with the offering by Medtronic Luxco, Medtronic, Inc. issued   $150 million   in principal amount of its   4.625 percent   Senior Notes due 2045 (the   Reopening Notes  ). The   Reopening Notes   are a further issuance of, and form a single series with, the   $4.0 billion   principal amount of Medtronic, Inc.'s previously outstanding   4.625 percent   Senior Notes due 2045. Interest on the   2017 Senior Notes   and the   Reopening Notes   is payable semi-annually. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the   2017 Senior Notes   and the   Reopening Notes   for general corporate purposes.  
  In April 2016, the Company completed a cash tender offer and redemption of   $2.7 billion   of senior notes for   $3.0 billion   of total consideration. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of   $163 million  , which included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in   interest expense, net   in the consolidated statements of income. In addition to the loss on debt extinguishment, we recognized   $20 million   of interest expense due to the acceleration of net losses on forward starting interest rate derivatives, which were terminated at the time of original debt issuances relating to the portion of debt extinguished in the tender offer.  
  At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , the Company had interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges of certain underlying fixed-rate obligations, including the Company s   $500 million     4.125 percent   2011 Senior Notes and   $675 million     3.125 percent   2012 Senior Notes. Refer to Note   9   for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements. 
  Term Loan     On January 26, 2015, Medtronic, Inc. borrowed   $3.0 billion   for a term of   three years   under a senior unsecured term loan credit agreement (the  Term Loan Credit Agreement ), among Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic, Medtronic Luxco, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement was entered into to finance, in part, the cash component of the acquisition of Covidien and certain transaction expenses. Medtronic and Medtronic Luxco have guaranteed the obligations of Medtronic, Inc. under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
  Contractual maturities of debt for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, excluding deferred financing costs, debt premium, net, and the fair value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements are as follows: 

Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value 
  At   April 28, 2017  , the estimated fair value of the Company s Senior Notes, including the current portion, was   $30.4 billion   compared to a principal value of   $28.9 billion  . At   April 29, 2016   the estimated fair value was   $29.8 billion   compared to a principal value of   $27.4 billion  . Fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the publicly registered senior notes, classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values and principal values consider the terms of the related debt and exclude the impacts of debt discounts and derivative/hedging activity. 
   
  9  .   Derivatives and Currency Exchange Risk Management    
  The Company uses operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk related to certain debt. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, the Company enters into derivative instruments, principally  
  
   89 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The primary currencies of the derivative instruments are the Euro and Japanese Yen. The Company does not enter into currency exchange rate derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding was   $10.8 billion   at both   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  . 
  The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by the Company, reasons the Company uses such instruments, and the impact such instruments have on the Company s consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, and statements of cash flows. 
  Freestanding Derivative Contracts 
  Freestanding derivative contracts are used to offset the Company s exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and to offset variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in other currencies. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. The gross notional amount of these contracts outstanding at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016   was   $4.9 billion   and   $5.0 billion  , respectively. 
  The amounts and classification of the gains in the consolidated statements of income related to derivative instruments, not designated as hedging instruments, for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015   are as follows: 

Cash Flow Hedges 
  Currency Exchange Rate Risk      
  Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of   accumulated other comprehensive loss  . The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings and is included in   other expense, net   or   cost of products sold   in the consolidated statements of income, depending on the underlying transaction that is being hedged, in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  
  No   gains or losses relating to ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges were recognized in earnings during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , or   2015  . No components of the hedge contracts were excluded in the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness and no hedges were derecognized or discontinued during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , or   2015  . The gross notional amount of these contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, outstanding at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016   was   $5.8 billion   and   $5.7 billion  , respectively, and will mature within the subsequent   three  -year period.

The amount of gross gains (losses), classification of the gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of income, and the accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (AOCI) related to the effective portion of currency exchange rate contract derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015   were as follows: 

Forecasted Debt Issuance Interest Rate Risk      
  Forward starting interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are designed to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt. The effective portion of the gains or losses on forward starting interest rate derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are reported as a component of   accumulated other comprehensive loss  . Beginning in the period in which the planned debt issuance occurs and the related derivative instruments are terminated, the effective portion of the gains or losses are then reclassified into   interest expense, net   over the term of the related debt. Any portion of the gains or losses that are determined to be ineffective are immediately recognized in   interest expense, net  . 
  No   gains or losses relating to ineffectiveness of forward starting interest rate derivative instruments were recognized in   interest expense, net   during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , or   2015  . No components of the hedge contracts were excluded in the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness. At   April 29, 2016  , the Company had   $300 million   of fixed pay, forward starting interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed rate of   3.10 percent   in anticipation of planned debt issuances. During fiscal year   2017  , in connection with the issuance of the 2017 Senior Notes, these swaps were terminated. Upon termination, there was no material ineffectiveness on the contracts which were in a net liability position, resulting in a cash payment of   $27 million  . During fiscal year   2016  , the Company terminated forward starting interest rate derivatives with a consolidated notional amount of   $500 million  , which were previously entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that was no longer expected. Upon termination, these swaps were in a net liability position, resulting in a cash payment of   $45 million  .  
  For fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , the reclassification of the effective portion of the net losses on forward starting interest rate derivative instruments from   accumulated other comprehensive loss   to   interest expense, net   was not significant. 
  There were   no   unrealized gains or losses on outstanding forward starting interest rate swap derivative instruments at   April 28, 2017  , as compared to unrealized losses of   $48 million   at   April 29, 2016  . Unrealized losses on outstanding forward starting interest rate swap derivative instruments were recorded in   other liabilities  , with the offset recorded in   accumulated other comprehensive loss   in the consolidated balance sheets. For fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , the Company recorded   $363 million   and   $(164) million   , respectively, of unrealized gains (losses) in   accumulated other comprehensive loss  .

At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , the Company had   $37 million   and   $(90) million  , respectively, in after-tax net unrealized gains (losses) associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in   accumulated other comprehensive loss  . The Company expects that   $73 million   of after-tax net unrealized gains at   April 28, 2017   will be reclassified into the consolidated statements of earnings over the next 12 months. 
  Fair Value Hedges 
  Interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are designed to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. 
  Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in   interest expense, net  , and are offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt instrument. The gains (losses) from terminated interest rate swap agreements are recognized in   long-term debt  , increasing (decreasing) the outstanding balances of the debt, and amortized as a reduction of (addition to)   interest expense, net   over the remaining life of the related debt. The cash flows from the termination of the interest rate swap agreements are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  
  At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , the Company had interest rate swaps in gross notional amounts of   $1.2 billion   designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed-rate senior note obligations including the Company s   $500 million     4.125   percent 2011 Senior Notes due 2021 and the   $675 million     3.125 percent   2012 Senior Notes due 2022.  
  At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , the market value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements was an unrealized gain of   $41 million   and   $89 million  , respectively, and the market value of the hedged items was an unrealized loss of   $41 million   and   $89 million  , respectively, which was recorded in   other assets   with the offsets recorded in   long-term debt   on the consolidated balance sheets.  
  No   significant hedge ineffectiveness was recorded as a result of these fair value hedges for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  . In addition, the Company did   no  t recognize any gains or losses during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , or   2015   on firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges.

The following table provides information by level for the derivative assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The Company has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. The following table provides information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria as stipulated by the terms of the master netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. Derivatives not subject to master netting arrangements are not eligible for net presentation.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of interest-bearing investments, forward exchange derivative contracts, and trade accounts receivable. Global concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.  
  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, and certain other financial instruments (including currency exchange rate and interest rate derivative contracts) with various major financial institutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standings of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. In addition, the Company has collateral credit agreements with its primary derivatives counterparties. Under these agreements, either party is required to post eligible collateral when the market value of transactions covered by the agreement exceeds specific thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties. At   April 28, 2017  , the Company received net cash collateral of   $60 million   from its counterparties. At   April 29, 2016  , the Company posted net cash collateral of   $25 million   to its counterparties. The collateral received was recorded in   cash and cash equivalents  , with the offset recorded as an increase in   other accrued expenses   on the consolidated balance sheets. The collateral posted was recorded in   prepaid expenses and other current assets  , with the offset recorded as a decrease in   cash and cash equivalents   on the consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  10  .   Inventories    
  Inventory balances, net of reserves, were as follows:

11  .   Property, Plant, and Equipment      
  Property, plant, and equipment balances and corresponding estimated useful lives were as follows: 

Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense of   $937 million  ,   $889 million  , and   $573 million   was recognized in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. Upon retirement or disposal of property, plant, and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds, is recognized in earnings.  
   
  12  .   Warranty Obligations        
  The following table presents the changes in the Company s product warranty obligations:  

13  .   Shareholders  Equity    
  Share Capital 
  Medtronic plc is authorized to issue   2.6 billion   Ordinary Shares,   $0.0001   par value;   40 thousand   Euro Deferred Shares,    1.00   par value;   127.5 million   Preferred Shares,   $0.20   par value; and   500 thousand   A Preferred Shares,   $1.00   par value. 
  Euro Deferred Shares 
  The authorized share capital of the Company includes   40 thousand   Euro Deferred Shares, with a par value of    1.00   per share. As of   April 28, 2017  ,   no   Euro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding. 
  Preferred Shares 
  The authorized share capital of the Company includes   127.5 million   of Preferred Shares, with a par value of   $0.20   per share. As of   April 28, 2017  ,   no   Preferred Shares were issued or outstanding. 
  A Preferred Shares 
  The Company issued   624   A Preferred Shares, par value   $1.00  , each to three of its advisors in connection with the transaction agreement associated with the Covidien acquisition dated June 15, 2014, for a total of   1,872   A Preferred Shares outstanding with an aggregate consideration of   $75 thousand  . The holders of A Preferred Shares are entitled to payment of dividends prior to any other class of shares in the Company equal to twice the dividend to be paid per Company ordinary share. On a return of assets,  
  
   96 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

whether on liquidation or otherwise, the A Preferred Shares are entitled to repayment of the capital paid up thereon in priority to any repayment of capital to the holders of any other shares and the holders of the A Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any further participation in the assets or profits of the Company. The holders of the A Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive notice of, nor to attend, speak, or vote at any general meeting of the Company.  
  Dividends 
  The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary and A Preferred shares falls within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, the Company's earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.  
    
  Ordinary Share Repurchase Program 
  Shares are repurchased from time to time to support the Company s stock-based compensation programs and to return capital to shareholders. During fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , the Company repurchased approximately   43 million   and   38 million   shares, respectively, at an average price of   $83.03   and   $74.92  , respectively. In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves, the redemption of   80 million   of the Company's ordinary shares. As of   April 28, 2017  , the Company had used   51 million   of the   80 million   shares authorized under the repurchase program, leaving approximately   29 million   shares available for future repurchases. In June 2017, the Company s Board of Directors replaced the existing June 2015 authorization to redeem up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares with an authorization to expend up to an aggregate amount of   $5 billion   beginning June 26, 2017 to redeem the Company s ordinary shares. The Company accounts for repurchases of ordinary shares using the par value method and shares repurchased are canceled. 
   
  14  .   Stock Purchase and Award Plans    
  The Medtronic, Inc. 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan was originally approved by the Company's shareholders in August 2013. In January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an amendment to and assumption of the existing Medtronic, Inc. 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, which created the new Medtronic plc 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (2013 Plan). In fiscal year   2017  , the Company granted stock awards under the 2013 Plan. The 2013 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock and cash-based awards. At   April 28, 2017  , there were approximately   21 million   shares available for future grants under the 2013 Plan. 
  Share Options     Options are granted at the exercise price, which is equal to the closing price of the Company s ordinary share on the grant date. The majority of the Company s options are non-qualified options with a   10  -year life and a   4  -year ratable vesting term. In fiscal year   2017  , the Company granted share options under the 2013 Plan. The Company also grants shares of performance-based share options that typically cliff vest after   three   years only if the Company has also achieved certain performance objectives. Performance awards are expensed over the performance period based on the probability of achieving the performance objectives.  
  Restricted Stock     Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively referred to as restricted stock) are granted to officers and key employees. At   April 28, 2017  , the Company does   no  t have any outstanding restricted stock awards. The Company grants restricted stock units that typically cliff vest after   four   years. The expense recognized for restricted stock units is equal to the grant date fair value, which is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Restricted stock units are expensed over the vesting period and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. The Company also grants shares of performance-based restricted stock units that typically cliff vest after   three   years only if the Company has also achieved certain performance objectives. Performance awards are expensed over the performance period based on the probability of achieving the performance objectives.  
  Restricted stock units are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Dividend equivalent units are accumulated on restricted stock units during the vesting period. In fiscal year   2017  , the Company granted restricted stock units under the 2013 Plan. At   April 28, 2017  , all restricted stock outstanding were restricted stock units.  
  Employees Stock Purchase Plan     The Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2014 Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) allows participating employees to purchase the Company's ordinary shares at a discount through payroll deductions. The expense recognized for shares purchased under the Company s ESPP is equal to the   15 percent   discount the employee receives at the end of the calendar quarter purchase period. 
  
   97 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Employees may contribute between   2   percent and   10 percent   of their wages or the statutory limit under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code toward the purchase of newly issued ordinary shares of the Company at   85 percent   of its market value at the end of the calendar quarter purchase period. Employees purchased   2 million   shares at an average price of   $68.68   per share in fiscal year   2017  . At   April 28, 2017  , plan participants had approximately   $11 million   withheld to purchase the Company's ordinary shares at   85 percent   of its market value on June 30, 2017, the last trading day before the end of the calendar quarter purchase period. At   April 28, 2017  , approximately   18 million   ordinary shares were available for future purchase under the ESPP.  
  Stock Option Valuation Assumptions     The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) to determine the fair value of stock options at the grant date. The fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, volatility of the Company s stock price, and expected dividends. 
  The following table provides the weighted average fair value of options granted to employees and the related assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model: 

(1) 
    Expected life:   The Company analyzes historical employee stock option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption. The Company calculates the expected life assumption using the midpoint scenario, which combines historical exercise data with hypothetical exercise data, as the Company believes this data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option. 
              (2) 
    Risk-free interest rate:   The rate is based on the grant date yield of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the option. 
              (3) 
    Volatility:   Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and an implied volatility of the Company s ordinary shares. Implied volatility is based on market traded options of the Company s ordinary shares. 
              (4) 
    Dividend yield:   The dividend yield rate is calculated by dividing the Company s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. 
     Stock-Based Compensation Expense     Pursuant to the transaction agreement associated with the Covidien acquisition dated June 15, 2014, outstanding stock option awards held by Covidien employees upon transaction close were converted into options to acquire the Company's ordinary shares in a manner designed to preserve the intrinsic value of such awards. In addition, unvested restricted stock units granted on or after June 15, 2014 which were held by Covidien employees upon close of the Covidien acquisition were converted into restricted stock units of the Company in a manner designed to preserve the intrinsic value of such awards. The modifications made to the restricted stock units granted on or after June 15, 2014 and all outstanding share options pursuant to the transaction agreement that converted such awards constituted modifications under the authoritative guidance for accounting for stock compensation. This guidance requires the Company to revalue the award upon the transaction close and allocate the revised fair value between consideration paid and continuing expense based on the ratio of service performed through the transaction date over the total service period of the award. The revised fair value allocated to post-combination services resulted in incremental expense which is recognized over the remaining service period of the award. The Company recognized   $23 million   and   $58 million   of incremental expense related to these modifications during fiscal year   2017   and   2016  , respectively, within   acquisition-related items   in the consolidated statements of income. Except for the conversion of share options and restricted stock units discussed herein, the material terms of these awards remained unchanged.

  15  .   Income Taxes    
  The provision for income taxes is based on income before income taxes reported for financial statement purposes. The components of income before provision for income taxes, based on tax jurisdiction, are as follows: 

The provision for income taxes consists of the following: 

100 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment of transactions under U.S. GAAP and income tax accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense has already been taken as a deduction on the Company s tax return but has not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income. Tax assets (liabilities), shown before jurisdictional netting of deferred tax assets (liabilities), are comprised of the following: 

At   April 28, 2017  , the Company had approximately   $24.9 billion   of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which     $22.0 billion   have no expiration, and the remaining   $2.9 billion   will expire during fiscal 2018 through 2037. Included in these net operating loss carryforwards are   $17.6 billion   of net operating losses related to a subsidiary of the Company, substantially all of which were recorded in fiscal 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from certain non-U.S. taxing authorities. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against these net operating losses, as management does  
  
   101 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized. Certain of the remaining non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of   $7.3 billion   have a valuation allowance recorded against the carryforwards, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized.    
  At   April 28, 2017  , the Company had   $1.0 billion   of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, which will expire during fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2036. For U.S. state purposes, the Company had   $690 million   of net operating loss carryforwards at   April 28, 2017  , which will expire during fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2037.  
  At   April 28, 2017  , the Company also had   $392 million   of tax credits available to reduce future income taxes payable, of which     $75 million   have no expiration, and the remaining credits expire during fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2037.  
  The Company has established valuation allowances of   $6.3 billion   and   $7.0 billion   at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively, primarily related to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets and primarily comprised of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The decrease in the valuation allowance during fiscal year   2017   is primarily driven by carryover attribute utilization and expiration, as well as the effects of currency fluctuations. These valuation allowances would result in a reduction to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income if they are ultimately not required. 
  At   April 28, 2017  , the Company had certain potential non-U.S. tax attributes that had not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements, including     $12.0 billion   of non-U.S. special deductions with an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has treated these amounts as special deductions for financial statement purposes since utilization is contingent upon the annual performance of certain economic factors. The Company expects to recognize a small portion of the special deduction annually based on meeting the defined economic factors. The Company continues to analyze whether the utilization of such benefits may be accelerated.  
  The Company s effective income tax rate from continuing operations varied from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as follows: 

(1) 
    Adjustments include the impact of inventory step-up, impact of product technology upgrade commitment, special charge (gain), net, restructuring charges, net, certain litigation charges, acquisition-related items, amortization of intangible assets, loss on previously held forward starting interest rate swaps, debt tender premium, impact of acquisition on interest expense, and certain tax adjustments, net.  
     During fiscal year   2017  , the Company recognized certain tax adjustments of   $202 million  , including the following:  
             
    A charge of   $404 million   associated with the IRS resolution for the Ardian, CoreValve, Inc., Ablation Frontiers, Inc., PEAK Surgical, Inc. and Salient Surgical Technologies, Inc. acquisition-related issues and the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for certain businesses.

    A net charge of   $125 million   associated with the expected divestiture of a portion of our Patient Monitoring   Recovery division to Cardinal Health.  The net charge primarily relates to the tax effect from the recognition of the outside basis difference of certain subsidiaries, which are included in the expected divestiture.

A charge of   $86 million   associated with the IRS s disallowance of the utilization of certain net operating losses, along with the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net operating loss deferred tax asset, which were recognized during the year.  
                
    A charge of   $18 million   as a result of the redemption of an intercompany minority interest during the year.   
                
    A benefit of   $431 million   as the result of the resolution of Covidien's previously disclosed Tyco International plc intercompany debt issues with the U.S. Tax Court and the Appeals Division of the IRS.  
     The   $202 million   of net certain tax adjustments were recognized in   provision for income taxes   in the consolidated statements of income for fiscal year   2017  . 
  During fiscal year   2016   the Company recognized certain tax adjustments of   $417 million  , which included the following: 
             
    A charge of   $442 million   primarily related to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the Company's completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy Covidien businesses that reduced the cash and investments held by its U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries (the Internal Reorganization). As a result of the Internal Reorganization, approximately   $9.7 billion   of cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities previously held by U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries became available for general corporate purposes.  
                
    A   $25 million   tax benefit associated with the disposition of a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary.  
     The   $417 million   of net certain tax adjustments were recorded in the   provision for income taxes   in the consolidated statements of income for fiscal year   2016  . 
  During fiscal year   2015  , the Company recognized certain tax adjustments of   $349 million  , which included the following: 
             
    A charge of   $329 million   related to the resolution of the Kyphon Inc. (Kyphon) acquisition-related issues with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  
                
    A charge of   $20 million   related to a taxable gain associated with the Covidien acquisition.  
     The   $349 million   of certain tax adjustments were recognized in   provision for income taxes   in the consolidated statements of income for fiscal year   2015  . 
  No deferred taxes have been provided for any portion of the approximately   $31.8 billion   and   $29.0 billion   of undistributed earnings of the Company s subsidiaries at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. During fiscal year 2017, the Company removed its permanently reinvested assertion on   $200 million   of undistributed earnings of certain subsidiaries in anticipation of the divestiture of a portion of its Patient Monitoring   Recovery division to Cardinal Health. Due to the number of legal entities and jurisdictions involved and the complexity of the legal entity structure of the Company, the complexity of the tax laws in the relevant jurisdictions, including, but not limited to the rules pertaining to the utilization of foreign tax credits in the United States and the impact of projections of income for future years to any calculations, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate, within any reasonable range, the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon distribution of these undistributed earnings. 
  Currently, the Company s operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Israel have various tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by   $475 million  ,   $474 million  , and   $414 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively, and earnings per diluted share by   $0.34  ,   $0.33  , and   $0.37   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. Unless these grants are extended, they will expire between fiscal years 2018 and 2029. The Company s historical practice has been to renew, extend, or obtain new tax incentive grants upon expiration of existing tax incentive grants. If the Company is not able to renew, extend, or obtain new tax incentive grants, the expiration of existing tax incentive grants could have a material impact on the Company s financial results in future periods.

The Company had   $1.9 billion  ,   $2.7 billion  , and   $2.9 billion   of gross unrecognized tax benefits at   April 28, 2017  ,   April 29, 2016  , and   April 24, 2015  , respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015   is as follows: 

If all of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits at   April 28, 2017  ,   April 29, 2016  , and   April 24, 2015   were recognized,   $1.8 billion  ,   $2.1 billion  , and   $2.2 billion   would impact the Company s effective tax rate, respectively. Although the Company believes that it has adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate in future periods. The Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of   $1.9 billion   as a long-term liability. The Company estimates that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that its uncertain tax positions, excluding interest, could decrease by as much as   $225 million  , net as a result of the resolution of tax matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities as well as statute of limitation lapses. 
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in   provision for income taxes   in the consolidated statements of income and records the liability in the current or long-term accrued income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. The Company had   $360 million  ,   $609 million  , and   $656 million   of accrued gross interest and penalties at   April 28, 2017  ,   April 29, 2016  , and   April 24, 2015  , respectively. During the fiscal years ended   April 28, 2017  ,   April 29, 2016  , and   April 24, 2015  , the Company recognized gross interest (income) expense of approximately   $(208) million  ,   $80 million  , and   $142 million  , respectively, in   provision for income taxes   in the consolidated statements of income. 
  The Company s reserves for uncertain tax positions relate to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. These reserves are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment. Resolution of these significant unresolved matters, or positions taken by the IRS or other tax authorities during future tax audits, could have a material impact on the Company s financial results in future periods. The Company continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and that it has meritorious defenses for its tax filings and will vigorously defend them during the audit process, appellate process, and through litigation in courts, as necessary.

  16  .   Earnings Per Share        
  Earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, as the Company's A Preferred Shares are considered participating securities. Accordingly, earnings are allocated to both ordinary shares and participating securities in determining earnings per ordinary share. Due to the limited number of A Preferred Shares outstanding, this allocation had no effect on the ordinary earnings per share; therefore, it is not presented below. Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding, increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive ordinary shares been issued, and reduced by the number of shares the Company could have repurchased from the proceeds from issuance of the potentially dilutive ordinary shares. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares include stock options and other stock-based awards granted under the stock-based compensation plans and shares committed to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.

The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

The calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding excludes options to purchase approximately   7 million  ,   4 million  , and   2 million   ordinary shares in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively, because their effect would be anti-dilutive on the Company s earnings per share. 
   
  17  .   Retirement Benefit Plans    
  The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans (pension benefits), post-retirement medical plans (post-retirement benefits), defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. The expense related to these plans was   $602 million  ,   $584 million  , and   $433 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
  In the U.S., the Company maintains a qualified pension plan designed to provide guaranteed minimum retirement benefits to all eligible U.S. employees. Pension coverage for non-U.S. employees is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. In addition, U.S. and Puerto Rico employees are also eligible to receive specified Company-paid health care and life insurance benefits through the Company s post-retirement benefits. In addition to the benefits provided under the qualified pension plan, retirement benefits associated with wages in excess of the IRS allowable limits are provided to certain employees under a non-qualified plan. 
  At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , the net underfunded status of the Company s benefit plans was   $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , respectively. The   $1.3 billion   underfunded status at April 28, 2017 included   $12 million   of liabilities classified as held for sale. The liabilities classified as held for sale consisted of   $9 million   related to pension benefits and   $3 million   related to post-retirement benefits.  
  During fiscal year   2017  , the Company offered certain eligible U.S. employees voluntary early retirement packages. The acceptance of this offer by eligible U.S. employees caused incremental expenses of   $73 million   to be recognized during fiscal year   2017  . Of this amount,   $60 million   related to U.S. pension benefits,   $7 million   related to U.S. post-retirement benefits,   $4 million   related to defined contribution plans, and   $2 million   related to cash payments and administrative fees.

In certain countries outside the U.S., fully funding pension plans is not a common practice, as funding provides no income tax benefit. Consequently, certain pension plans were partially funded at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  . U.S. and non-U.S. plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following: 

Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following: 

The net periodic benefit cost of the plans include the following components: 

The other changes in plan assets and projected benefit obligations recognized in   accumulated other comprehensive loss   for fiscal year   2017   are as follows:

The actuarial assumptions are as follows: 

The Company changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, effective April 30, 2016. Previously, the Company estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the market-observed yield curves of high-quality fixed income securities used to measure the pension benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The current yield curves represent high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company s pension obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The Company accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. 
  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are determined using a building block approach, considering historical averages and real returns of each asset class. In certain countries, where historical returns are not meaningful, consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns. 
  Retirement Benefit Plan Investment Strategy     The Company sponsors trusts that hold the assets for U.S. pension plans and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans, primarily retiree medical benefits. For investment purposes, the legacy Medtronic U.S. pension and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans are managed in an identical way, as their objectives are similar. 
  The Company has a Qualified Plan Committee (the Plan Committee) that sets investment guidelines for U.S. pension plans and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans with the assistance of external consultants. These guidelines are established based on market conditions, risk tolerance, funding requirements, and expected benefit payments. The Plan Committee also oversees the investment allocation process, selects the investment managers, and monitors asset performance. As pension liabilities are long-term in nature, the Company employs a long-term total return approach to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets for a prudent level of risk. An annual analysis on the risk versus the return of the investment portfolio is conducted to justify the expected long-term rate of return assumption. 
  The investment portfolios contain a diversified allocation of investment categories, including equities, fixed income securities, hedge funds, and private equity. Securities are also diversified in terms of domestic and international, short- and long-term, growth and value styles, large cap and small cap stocks, active and passive management, and derivative-based styles. 
  Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. There is significant variation in policy asset allocation from country to country. Local regulations, funding rules, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The weighted average target asset allocations at   April 28, 2017   for the plans are   37%   equity securities,   29%   debt securities, and   34%   other.

The plans did not hold any investments in the Company s ordinary shares at   April 28, 2017   or   April 29, 2016  . 
  The Company s U.S. plans target asset allocations at   April 28, 2017  , compared to the U.S. plans actual asset allocations at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016   by asset category, are as follows: 

Retirement Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values     The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for retirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value:  
  Short-term investments:   Valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded. 
  U.S. government securities:   Certain U.S. government securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded. Other U.S. government securities are valued based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable. 
  Corporate debt securities:   Valued based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable. 
  Equity commingled trusts:   Comprised of investments in equity securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of equity commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.  
  Fixed income commingled trusts:   Comprised of investments in fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of fixed income commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.  
  Partnership units:   Valued based on the year-end net asset values of the underlying partnerships. The net asset values of the partnerships are based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the partnerships. Quoted market prices are used to value the underlying investments of the partnerships, where the partnerships consist of the investment pools which invest primarily in common stocks. Partnership units include partnerships, private equity investments, and real asset investments. Partnerships primarily include long/short equity and absolute return strategies. These investments may be redeemed monthly with notice periods ranging from   45   to   95   days. At   April 28, 2017  , there is one absolute return strategy fund totaling   $2 million   that is in the process of liquidation. The Company expects to receive the proceeds over the next year. Private equity investments consist of common stock and debt instruments of private companies. For private equity funds, the sum of the unfunded commitments at   April 28, 2017   is   $158 million  , and the estimated liquidation period of these funds is expected to be   one   to   15 years  . Real asset investments consist of commodities, derivatives, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and illiquid real estate holdings. These investments have redemption and liquidation periods ranging from   30 days   to   10 years  . At   April 28, 2017  , there is one real estate investment totaling   $1 million   that is in the process of liquidation. The Company expects to receive the proceeds over the next year. Other valuation procedures are utilized to arrive at fair value if a quoted market price is not available for a partnership investment. 
  Registered investment companies:   Valued at net asset values which are not publicly reported. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets. The underlying assets are valued at the quoted market prices of shares held by the plan at year-end in the active market on which the individual securities are traded. 
  Insurance contracts:   Comprised of investments in collective (group) insurance contracts, consisting of individual insurance policies. The policyholder is the employer and each member is the owner/beneficiary of their individual insurance policy. These policies are a part of the insurance company s general portfolio and participate in the insurer s profit-sharing policy on an excess yield basis.

The methods described above may produce fair values that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 
  There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during fiscal years   2017   or   2016  . 
  The following tables provide information by level for the retirement benefit plan assets that are measured at fair value, as defined by U.S. GAAP. See Note 1 for discussion of the fair value measurement terms of Levels 1, 2, and 3. In accordance with authoritative guidance adopted in fiscal year 2017, certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are not presented within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented for these investments are intended to permit reconciliation to the total fair value of plan assets at April 28, 2017 and April 29, 2016. The revised presentation has been applied retrospectively and fiscal year   2016   values have been reclassified to conform to classifications used in the current year.

Non-U.S. Pension Benefits 

The following tables provide a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of non-U.S. pension benefit assets measured at fair value that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

Retirement Benefit Plan Funding     It is the Company s policy to fund retirement costs within the limits of allowable tax deductions. During fiscal year   2017  , the Company made discretionary contributions of approximately   $183 million   to the U.S. pension plan. Internationally, the Company contributed approximately   $76 million   for pension benefits during fiscal year   2017  . The Company anticipates that it will make contributions of   $302 million   to its pension benefits in fiscal year   2018  . Based on the guidelines under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the various guidelines which govern the plans outside the U.S., the majority of anticipated fiscal year 2018 contributions will be discretionary. The Company believes that, along with pension

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

assets, the returns on invested pension assets, and Company contributions, the Company will be able to meet its pension and other post-retirement obligations in the future. 
  Retiree benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are anticipated to be paid as follows: 

Post-retirement Benefit Plans   The net periodic benefit cost associated with the Company s post-retirement benefit plans was   $11 million  ,   $12 million  , and   $14 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. The Company s projected benefit obligation for all post-retirement benefit plans was   $323 million   and   $369 million   at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. The Company s fair value of plan assets for all post-retirement benefit plans was   $289 million   and   $269 million   at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , respectively. The decrease in the Company's projected benefit obligation during fiscal year   2017   was due to the U.S. post-retirement benefit plan being frozen, effective January 1, 2018. The activity during fiscal year   2016   related to the change in projected benefit obligation was not material. The activity during fiscal years   2017   and   2016   related to the change in fair value of plan assets was not material. 
  Defined Contribution Savings Plans    The Company has defined contribution savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees. The general purpose of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings. Company contributions to the plans are based on employee contributions and Company performance. Expense recognized under these plans was   $347 million  ,   $269 million  , and   $188 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
  Effective May 1, 2005, the Company froze participation in the original defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. and implemented   two   new plans: an additional defined benefit pension plan, the Personal Pension Account (PPA), and a new defined contribution plan, the Personal Investment Account (PIA). Employees in the U.S. hired on or after May 1, 2005 but before January 1, 2016 had the option to participate in either the PPA or the PIA. Participants in the PPA receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus on which they will receive an annual guaranteed rate of return which is based on the   ten  -year Treasury bond rate. Participants in the PIA also receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus; however, they are allowed to determine how to invest their funds among identified fund alternatives. The cost associated with the PPA is included in U.S. Pension Benefits in the tables presented earlier. The defined contribution cost associated with the PIA was approximately   $58 million  ,   $58 million  , and   $53 million   in fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company froze participation in the existing defined benefit (PPA) and contribution (PIA) pension plans in the U.S. and implemented a new form of benefit under the existing defined contribution plan for legacy Covidien employees and employees in the U.S. hired on or after January 1, 2016. Participants in the Medtronic Core Contribution (MCC) also receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus and are allowed to determine how to invest their funds among identified fund alternatives. The defined contribution cost associated with the MCC was approximately $  45 million   and   $12 million   in fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
   
  18  .   Leases    
  The Company leases office, manufacturing, and research facilities and warehouses, as well as transportation, data processing, and other equipment under capital and operating leases. A substantial number of these leases contain options that allow the Company to renew at the fair rental value on the date of renewal.

  The following table provides changes in AOCI, net of tax and by component.    

  The income tax on gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015   was an expense of   $41 million  , a benefit of   $94 million  , and an expense of   $60 million  , respectively. During fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015  , realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of   $8 million   in fiscal years   2017   and   2016   and   $49 million   in fiscal year   2015  .

  Taxes are not provided on cumulative translation adjustments as substantially all translation adjustments relate to earnings that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  
  The net change in retirement obligations in other comprehensive income includes net amortization of prior service costs and actuarial losses included in net periodic benefit cost. The income tax on the net change in retirement obligations in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015   was an expense of   $41 million  , a benefit of   $85 million  , and a benefit of   $198 million  , respectively.

  20  .   Commitments and Contingencies    
  The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, income tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations in the United States and around the world, including those described below. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. As a result, interaction with governmental agencies is ongoing. The Company's standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within the Company s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions. The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. At   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  , accrued certain litigation charges were approximately   $1.1 billion   and   $1.0 billion  , respectively. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued certain litigation charges could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position, or cash flows. The Company includes accrued certain litigation charges in   other accrued expenses   and   other liabilities   on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  In addition to litigation contingencies, the Company also has certain income tax and guarantee obligations that may potentially result in future charges. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that charges associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position, or cash flows. 
  Product Liability Matters 
  Sprint Fidelis 
  In 2007, a putative class action was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly related to the Company's Sprint Fidelis family of defibrillation leads. On October 20, 2009, the court certified a class proceeding but denied class certification on plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages. Pretrial proceedings are underway. The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with this matter because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter. 
  INFUSE Litigation 
  The Company estimated law firms representing approximately   6,000   claimants asserted or intended to assert personal injury claims against Medtronic in the U.S. state and federal courts involving the INFUSE bone graft product. As of June 1, 2017, the Company has reached agreements to settle substantially all of these claims, resolving this litigation. The Company's accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued certain litigation charges in   other accrued expenses   and   other liabilities   on the consolidated balance sheets as discussed above.

Other INFUSE Litigation 
  On June 5, 2014, Humana, Inc. filed a lawsuit for unspecified monetary damages in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, alleging that Medtronic, Inc. violated federal racketeering (RICO) law and various state laws, by conspiring with physicians to promote unapproved uses of INFUSE. In September of 2015 the Court granted Medtronic s motion to dismiss the primary allegations, including the RICO claims, in Humana s complaint. In April of 2016, the Court denied Humana s motion to file an amended complaint. The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with this matter because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter. 
  Pelvic Mesh Litigation 
  The Company, through the acquisition of Covidien, is currently involved in litigation in various state and federal courts against manufacturers of pelvic mesh products alleging personal injuries resulting from the implantation of those products. Two subsidiaries of Covidien supplied pelvic mesh products to one of the manufacturers, C.R. Bard (Bard), named in the litigation. The litigation includes a federal multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia and cases in various state courts and jurisdictions outside the U.S. Generally, complaints allege design and manufacturing claims, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraud, violations of state consumer protection laws and loss of consortium claims. In fiscal year 2016, Bard paid the Company   $121 million   towards the settlement of   11,000   of these claims. In May 2017, the agreement with Bard was amended to extend the terms to apply to up to an additional   5,000   claims. That agreement does not resolve the dispute between the Company and Bard with respect to claims that do not settle, if any. As part of the agreement, the Company and Bard agreed to dismiss without prejudice their pending litigation with respect to Bard s obligation to defend and indemnify the Company. The Company estimates law firms representing approximately   15,800   claimants have asserted or may assert claims involving products manufactured by Covidien s subsidiaries. As of June 1, 2017, the Company has reached agreements to settle approximately   12,300   of these claims. The Company's accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued certain litigation charges in   other accrued expenses   and   other liabilities   on the consolidated balance sheets as discussed above. 
  Patent Litigation 
  Ethicon 
  On December 14, 2011, Ethicon filed an action against Covidien in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging patent infringement and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On January 22, 2014, the district court entered summary judgment in Covidien's favor, and the majority of this ruling was affirmed by the Federal Circuit on August 7, 2015.  Following appeal, the case was remanded back to the District Court with respect to   one   patent. On January 21, 2016, Covidien filed a second action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, seeking a declaration of non-infringement with respect to a second set of patents held by Ethicon. The court consolidated this second action with the remaining patent issues from the first action. Following consolidation of the cases, Ethicon dismissed   6   of the asserted patents, leaving a single asserted patent. In addition to claims of non-infringement, the Company asserts an affirmative defense of invalidity. The case is currently in the discovery stage. The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with this matter because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter.  
  Shareholder Related Matters 
  INFUSE 
  On March 12, 2012, Charlotte Kokocinski (Kokocinski) filed a shareholder derivative action against both Medtronic, Inc. and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, setting forth certain allegations, including a claim that defendants violated various purported duties in connection with the INFUSE bone graft product and otherwise. On March 25, 2013, the District Court dismissed the case without prejudice, and Kokocinski subsequently filed an amended complaint. On March 30, 2015, the District Court granted defendants  motion to dismiss the amended complaint, dismissing the case with prejudice. Kokocinski sought reconsideration of that decision, and, on September 30, 2015, the District Court denied Kokocinski s request for reconsideration. Kokocinski appealed the District Court s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On March 1, 2017, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower Court s dismissal of the case with prejudice, and on April 11, 2017, the Eighth Circuit rejected Kokocinski s request for reconsideration. 
  West Virginia Pipe Trades and Phil Pace, on June 27, 2013 and July 3, 2013, respectively, filed putative class action complaints against Medtronic, Inc. and certain of its officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleging that the defendants  
  
   116 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

made false and misleading public statements and engaged in a scheme to defraud regarding the INFUSE Bone Graft product during the period of December 8, 2010 through August 3, 2011. The matters were consolidated in September, 2013, and in the consolidated complaint plaintiffs alleged a class period of September 28, 2010 through August 3, 2011. On September 30, 2015, the District Court granted defendants  motion for summary judgment in the consolidated matters. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and in December of 2016 the Eighth Circuit Court reversed and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. 
  COVIDIEN ACQUISITION 
  On July 2, 2014, Lewis Merenstein filed a putative shareholder class action in Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court seeking to enjoin the then-potential acquisition of Covidien. The lawsuit named Medtronic, Inc., Covidien, and each member of the Medtronic, Inc. Board of Directors at the time as defendants, and alleged that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders with regard to the then-potential acquisition. On August 21, 2014, Kenneth Steiner filed a putative shareholder class action in Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court, also seeking an injunction to prevent the potential Covidien acquisition. In September 2014, the   Merenstei  n and   Steiner   matters were consolidated and in December 2014, the plaintiffs filed a preliminary injunction motion seeking to enjoin the Covidien transaction. On December 30, 2014, a hearing was held on plaintiffs  motion for preliminary injunction and on defendants  motion to dismiss. On January 2, 2015, the District Court denied the plaintiffs  motion for preliminary injunction and on January 5, 2015 issued its opinion. On March 20, 2015, the District Court issued its order and opinion granting Medtronic s motion to dismiss the case. In May of 2015, the plaintiffs filed an appeal, and, in January of 2016, the Minnesota State Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In February of 2016, the Company petitioned the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the decision of the Minnesota State Court of Appeals, and on April 19, 2016 the Minnesota Supreme Court granted the Company s petition on the issue of whether most of the original claims are properly characterized as direct or derivative under Minnesota law. A decision from the Minnesota Supreme Court is expected in calendar year 2017.  
  HEARTWARE 
  On January 22, 2016, the St. Paul Teachers  Retirement Fund Association filed a putative class action complaint (the  Complaint ) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against HeartWare on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of HeartWare from June 10, 2014 through January 11, 2016 (the  Class Period ). The Complaint was amended on June 29, 2016 and claims HeartWare and one of its executives violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making false and misleading statements about, among other things, HeartWare s response to a June 2014 U.S. FDA warning letter, the development of the Miniaturized Ventricular Assist Device (MVAD) System and the proposed acquisition of Valtech Cardio Ltd. The Complaint seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers or acquirers of HeartWare s stock during the Class Period. In August of 2016 the Company acquired HeartWare. 
  The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with the shareholder related matters, because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters. 
  Environmental Proceedings 
  The Company, through the acquisition of Covidien, is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. 
  The Company is a successor to a company which owned and operated a chemical manufacturing facility in Orrington, Maine from 1967 until 1982, and is responsible for the costs of completing an environmental site investigation as required by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP). MDEP served a compliance order on Mallinckrodt LLC and U.S. Surgical Corporation, subsidiaries of Covidien, in December 2008, which included a directive to remove a significant volume of soils at the site. After a hearing on the compliance order before the Maine Board of Environmental Protection (Maine Board) to challenge the terms of the compliance order, the Maine Board modified the MDEP order and issued a final order requiring removal of   two   landfills, capping of the remaining   three   landfills, installation of a groundwater extraction system and long-term monitoring of the site and the   three   remaining landfills. 
  The Company has proceeded with implementation of the investigation and remediation at the site in accordance with the MDEP order as modified by the Maine Board order.

The Company has also been involved in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Maine People s Alliance. Plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring Covidien to conduct extensive studies of mercury contamination of the Penobscot River and Bay and options for remediating such contamination, and to perform appropriate remedial activities, if necessary. 
  On July 29, 2002, following a March 2002 trial, the District Court entered an opinion and order which held that conditions in the Penobscot River and Bay may pose an imminent and substantial endangerment and that Covidien was liable for the cost of performing a study of the river and bay. The District Court subsequently appointed an independent study panel to oversee the study and ordered Covidien to pay costs associated with the study. A report issued by the study panel contains recommendations for a variety of potential remedial options which could be implemented individually or in a variety of combinations, and included preliminary cost estimates for a variety of potential remedial options, which the report describes as  very rough estimates of cost,  ranging from   $25 million   to   $235 million  . The report indicates that these costs are subject to uncertainties, and that before any remedial option is implemented, further engineering studies and engineering design work are necessary to determine the feasibility of the proposed remedial options. In June of 2014, a trial was held to determine if remediation was necessary and feasible, and on September 2, 2015, the District Court issued an order concluding that further engineering study and engineering design work is appropriate to determine the nature and extent of remediation in the Penobscot River and Bay. In January of 2016, the Court appointed an engineering firm to conduct the next phase of the study. The study is targeted for completion late calendar year 2017. 
  The Company's accrued expenses for environmental proceedings are included within accrued certain litigation charges in   other accrued expenses   and   other liabilities   on the consolidated balance sheets as discussed above. 
  Government Matters 
  Medtronic has received subpoenas or document requests from the Attorneys General in Massachusetts, California, Oregon, Illinois, and Washington seeking information regarding sales, marketing, clinical, and other information relating to the INFUSE bone graft product. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company accrued expenses in connection with these matters, which are included within accrued certain litigation charges in   other accrued expenses   and   other liabilities   on the consolidated balance sheets as discussed above. 
  On May 2, 2011, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the District of Massachusetts issued a subpoena to ev3, a subsidiary of the Company, requesting production of documents relating to sales and marketing and other issues in connection with several neurovascular products. The matters under investigation relate to activities prior to Covidien's acquisition of ev3 in 2010. ev3 complied as required with the subpoena and cooperated with the investigation. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company accrued expenses in connection with this matter, which are included within accrued certain litigation charges in   other accrued expenses   and   other liabilities   on the consolidated balance sheets as discussed above. 
  On September 2, 2014, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Northern District of California, issued a subpoena requesting production of documents relating to sales and marketing practices associated with certain of ev3 s peripheral vascular products. The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with this matter, because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter.  
  Income Taxes     
  In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. On December 23, 2010, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency with respect to the remaining issues. Medtronic, Inc. filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court on March 21, 2011 objecting to the deficiency. During October and November 2012, Medtronic, Inc. reached resolution with the IRS on various matters, including the deductibility of a settlement payment. Medtronic, Inc. and the IRS agreed to hold one issue, the calculation of amounts eligible for the one-time repatriation holiday, because such specific issue was being addressed by other taxpayers in litigation with the IRS. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The U.S. Tax Court proceeding with respect to this issue began on February 3, 2015 and ended on March 12, 2015. On June 9, 2016, the U.S. Tax court issued its opinion with respect to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The U.S. Tax Court generally rejected the IRS s position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. During November 2016, Medtronic and the IRS entered into a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the Tax Court which resolved the one-time repatriation holiday as an outstanding issue unless, either party decided to appeal the Tax Court Opinion and a final decision is inconsistent with the U.S. Tax Court Opinion. The

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

U.S. Tax Court entered their final decision on January 25, 2017. On April 21, 2017, the IRS filed their Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit regarding the Tax Court Opinion.  A hearing date for the Appeal has not been set. 
  In October 2011, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company finalized its agreement with the IRS on the proposed adjustments associated with the tax effects of the Company's acquisition of Kyphon Inc. (Kyphon). The settlement was consistent with the certain tax adjustment recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, an expected settlement was reached with the IRS for all outstanding issues for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 except for the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. 
  In April 2014, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, an expected settlement was reached with the IRS for all outstanding issues for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 except for the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, an expected settlement was reached with the IRS associated with the tax effects of the Company s acquisition of PEAK Surgical, Inc. and Salient Surgical Technologies, Inc. However, the IRS continues to audit Medtronic, Inc.'s U.S. federal income tax returns for the fiscal years 2012 through 2014. 
  Covidien and the IRS have concluded and reached agreement on its audit of Covidien s U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. The IRS continues to audit Covidien s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2010 through 2012.  
  The IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and proposed tax adjustments, several of which also affect Covidien s income tax returns for certain years after 2000. Tyco International appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the IRS and had resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments. The IRS asserted that substantially all of Tyco International s intercompany debt originating during the years 1997 through 2000 should not be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and disallowed interest deductions related to the intercompany debt and certain tax attribute adjustments recognized on Tyco International s U.S. income tax returns. The Company disagreed with the IRS s proposed adjustments and, on July 22, 2013, Tyco International filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the IRS assessment. On January 15, 2016, Tyco International, as audit managing party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, entered into Stipulations of Settled Issues with the IRS intended to resolve all Federal tax disputes related to this intercompany debt issue for the Tax Sharing Participants for the 1997 - 2000 audit cycle before the U.S. Tax Court. The Stipulations of Settled Issues were contingent upon the IRS Appeals Division applying the same settlement terms to all intercompany debt issues on appeal for subsequent audit cycles (2001 - 2007). On May 17, 2016 the IRS Office of Appeals issued fully executed Forms 870-AD that effectively settled the matters on appeal on the same terms as those set forth in the Stipulations of Settled Issues, and on May 31, 2016 the U.S. Tax Court entered decisions consistent with the Stipulations of Settled Issues. As a result, all aspects of this controversy that were before the U.S. Tax Court and Appeals Division of the IRS have been finally resolved for audit cycles from 1997-2007. 
  See Note   15   for additional discussion of income taxes. 
  Guarantees 
  As a result of the acquisition of Covidien, the Company has guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International, TE Connectivity Ltd. (TE Connectivity), and Mallinckrodt plc (Mallinckrodt) which relate to certain contingent tax liabilities.  
  On June 29, 2007, Covidien entered into the Tax Sharing Agreement, under which Covidien shares responsibility for certain of its, Tyco International s and TE Connectivity s income tax liabilities for periods prior to Covidien s 2007 separation from Tyco International (2007 separation). Covidien, Tyco International and TE Connectivity share   42   percent,   27   percent, and   31   percent, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Covidien's, Tyco International s and TE Connectivity s U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 separation. If Tyco International and TE Connectivity default on their obligations to the Company under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these tax liabilities are being shared equally among the parties. 
  In connection with the 2007 separation, all tax liabilities associated with Covidien business became Covidien s tax liabilities. Following Covidien s spin-off of its Pharmaceuticals business to Covidien shareholders through a distribution of all the outstanding  
  
   119 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Medtronic plc 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

ordinary shares of Mallinkrodt (2013 separation), Mallinckrodt became the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for the tax liabilities attributable to its subsidiaries, a significant portion of which relate to periods prior to the 2007 separation. However, Covidien remains the sole party subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. Accordingly, Mallinckrodt does not share in the Company's liability to Tyco International and TE Connectivity, nor in the receivable that the Company has from Tyco International and TE Connectivity. 
  If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party s fault, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and be required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the Company s agreed upon share of Covidien's, Tyco International s and TE Connectivity s tax liabilities. 
  The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to periods prior to the 2007 separation, including amounts subject to or impacted by the provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement. The actual amounts that the Company may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement, however, could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters. Final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods, primarily related to certain pre-2007 separation tax liabilities and tax years open for examination. These balances will also be impacted by the filing of final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien and/or TE Connectivity legal entities for periods prior to the 2007 separation. The resolutions with the U.S. Tax Court and IRS Appeals for fiscal years 1997 through 2007 were finalized during May 2016.  However, the Tax Sharing Agreement remains in place with respect to income tax liabilities that are not the subject of such resolution. 
  In conjunction with the 2013 separation, Mallinckrodt assumed the tax liabilities that are attributable to its subsidiaries, and Covidien indemnified Mallinckrodt to the extent that such tax liabilities arising from periods prior to 2013 exceed   $200 million  , net of certain tax benefits realized. In addition, in connection with the 2013 separation, Covidien entered into certain other guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Mallinckrodt. 
  Except as described above in this note or for certain income tax related matters, the Company has not recognized an expense related to losses in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters. 
  In the normal course of business, the Company and/or its affiliates periodically enter into agreements that require one or more of them to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company or its affiliates  products or the negligence of any of their personnel or claims alleging that any of their products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. The Company s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated, and the Company has not accrued any liabilities within the consolidated financial statements. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnifications.

  The following presents the Company s consolidating statements of comprehensive income and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows as of and for the fiscal years ended   April 28, 2017  ,   April 29, 2016  , and   April 24, 2015  , and condensed consolidating balance sheets at   April 28, 2017   and   April 29, 2016  . The guarantees provided by the Parent Company Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors are joint and several. Condensed consolidating financial information for Medtronic plc, Medtronic Luxco, Medtronic, Inc., CIFSA, and CIFSA Subsidiary Guarantors, on a stand-alone basis, is presented using the equity method of accounting for subsidiaries. 
    
  During fiscal year 2017, the Company undertook certain steps to reorganize ownership of various subsidiaries. The transactions were entirely among subsidiaries under the common control of Medtronic. This reorganization has been reflected as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.  
  The Company made revisions to its consolidating statements of comprehensive income of the guarantees of the Medtronic Senior Notes and CIFSA Senior notes as previously presented in Note 19 in the Company s Annual Report on 10-K for fiscal year 2016 due to an incorrect presentation of the equity in net (income) loss of subsidiaries balances for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2016. In the consolidating statements of comprehensive income of the guarantees of the Medtronic Senior Notes, the   $7.1 billion   revision resulted in additional income reported in the equity in net (income) loss of subsidiaries line item in the Medtronic, Inc. column. In the consolidating statements of comprehensive income of the guarantees of the CIFSA Senior Notes, the   $7.1 billion   revision resulted in reduced income reported in the equity in net (income) loss of subsidiaries line item in the CIFSA column. There is no impact to the consolidated financial statements of Medtronic plc as previously filed in the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
  The Company made revisions to its condensed consolidating balance sheets of the guarantees of the Medtronic Senior Notes and CIFSA Senior Notes as previously presented in Note 19 in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 primarily due to an income statement error recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, resulting in an incorrect presentation of the investment in subsidiaries balances. In the condensed consolidating balance sheet of the guarantees of the Medtronic Senior Notes, the   $5.1 billion   revision increased the line items investment in subsidiaries and total equity in the Medtronic, Inc. column. In the condensed consolidating balance sheet of the guarantees of the CIFSA Senior Notes, the   $5.1 billion   revision decreased the line items investment in subsidiaries and total equity in the CIFSA column. There is no impact to the consolidated financial statements of Medtronic plc as previously filed in the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

The Company made revisions to the condensed consolidating balance sheets of the guarantees of the Medtronic Senior Notes and CIFSA Notes as previously presented in Note 19 in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 due to an incorrect presentation of intercompany capital contributions. The   $20.5 billion   revision decreased the investment in subsidiaries and intercompany payable balances in the Medtronic plc column and decreased the investment in subsidiaries and total equity balances in the Medtronic Luxco and CIFSA Subsidiary Guarantors column in the condensed consolidating balance sheets of the guarantees of the Medtronic Senior Notes and CIFSA Senior Notes, respectively, decreased the intercompany receivable and total equity balances in Medtronic, Inc. column in the condensed consolidating balance sheets of the guarantees of the Medtronic Senior Notes, and decreased the intercompany receivable and total equity balances in the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors column. There is no impact to the consolidated financial statements of Medtronic plc as previously filed in the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
  Not applicable. 
   
  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective at   April 28, 2017  . Our internal control over financial reporting at   April 28, 2017  , has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who has also audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report in the section entitled  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,  which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting at   April 28, 2017  , which is included in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  The Company is deploying an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software program, SAP, to the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. During fiscal year 2017, Medtronic continued the deployment of this software along with other enterprise systems, which resulted in a material change to the internal controls over financial reporting for the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. The internal controls were updated to reflect these changes. These system deployments will continue with projected completion in fiscal year 2020. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.109 
  MEDTRONIC plc 
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
  AMENDED AND RESTATED 2013 STOCK AWARD AND INCENTIVE PLAN 
           1. 
    Restricted Stock Units Award  . Medtronic plc, an Irish public limited company (the  Company ), hereby awards to the individual named above Restricted Stock Units, in the number and on the Grant Date as each is set forth above. The Restricted Stock Units represent the right to receive ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Shares ), subject to the restrictions, limitations, and conditions contained in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the  Agreement ) and in the Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the  Plan ). Unless otherwise defined in the Agreement, a capitalized term in the Agreement will have the same meaning as in the Plan. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan will govern. 
       
           2. 
    Vesting   Distribution  . The Restricted Stock Units will vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Grant Date. The Company will issue to you a number of Shares equal to the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) within six weeks following each applicable vesting date, provided that you have not incurred a Termination of Employment prior to such vesting date (the  Restricted Period ). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if you incur a Termination of Employment during the Restricted Period as a result of your death, Disability or Retirement, you will vest in the next tranche of your Restricted Stock Units on a pro rata basis (based on the length of time you were employed during the applicable portion of the Restricted Period), and the Company will issue you a number of Shares equal to the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) within six weeks following your separation from service. Any portion of the Restricted Stock Units that does not vest in accordance with the foregoing will automatically be forfeited and canceled by the Company as of 11:00 p.m. CT (midnight ET) on the date of such Termination of Employment. Upon your Termination of Employment during the Restricted Period for any reason other than death, Disability or Retirement, the Restricted Stock Units will automatically be forfeited in full and canceled by the Company as of 11:00 p.m. CT (midnight ET) on the date of such Termination of Employment. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms  Disability  and  Retirement  shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms, as of the date of this Agreement, under any retirement plan of the Company which is qualified under Section 401 of the Code (which currently provides for retirement on or after age 55, provided you have been employed by the Company and/or one or more Affiliates for at least ten years, or retirement on or after age 62), or under any disability or retirement plan of the Company or any Affiliate applicable to you due to employment by a non-U.S. Affiliate or employment in a non-U.S. location.  
       
           3.  
    Forfeiture  . If you have received or are entitled to receive delivery of Shares as a result of this Agreement within the period beginning six months prior to the date of your Termination of Employment and ending twelve months following the date of your Termination of Employment, the Company, in its sole discretion, may require you to return or forfeit the cash and/or Shares received or receivable with respect to this Restricted Stock Units award, in the event that you engage in any of the following activities: 
              a. 
    performing services for or on behalf of any competitor of, or competing with, the Company or any Affiliate, within six months of the date of your Termination of Employment; 
              b. 
    unauthorized disclosure of material proprietary information of the Company or any Affiliate; 
              c. 
    a violation of applicable business ethics policies or business policies of the Company or any Affiliate; or 
              d. 
    any other occurrence determined by the Committee. 
     The Company s right to require forfeiture must be exercised not later than 90 days after the Company acquires actual knowledge of such an activity but in no event later than twelve months after your Termination of Employment. Such right shall be deemed to be exercised upon the Company s mailing written notice of such exercise to your most recent home address as shown on the personnel records of the Company. In addition to requiring forfeiture as described herein, the Company may exercise its rights under this Section 3 by terminating the Restricted Stock Units awarded under this Agreement. 

If you fail or refuse to forfeit the cash and/or shares of Common Stock demanded by the Company (the number of such shares of Common Stock as may be adjusted for any events described in Section 3.4 of the Plan), you shall be liable to the Company for damages equal to the number of Shares demanded times the highest closing price per share of the Common Stock during the period between the date of your Termination of Employment and the date of any judgment or award to the Company, together with all costs and attorneys  fees incurred by the Company to enforce this provision. 
  For purposes of this Section 3, forfeiture of Common Stock shall be effected by the redemption of such Common Stock in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and to the extent permissible under applicable law. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 3 shall have no application following a Change of Control, nor shall the Company s Incentive Compensation Forfeiture Policy apply following a Change of Control to the Restricted Stock Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement or to any proceeds in respect of such award. 
           4.  
    Change of Control  . Notwithstanding anything in Section 2 of this Agreement to the contrary, if a Change of Control of the Company occurs during the Restricted Period, then the Restricted Stock Units will become 100% vested upon such Change of Control, and the Company will issue to you a number of Shares equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units (including any dividend equivalents described in Section 5, below) within six weeks following the Change of Control, provided that no such vesting or issuance shall occur if the Restricted Stock Units are replaced or continued by a Replacement Award that satisfies the requirements of Section 10.1(b) of the Plan. In the event that the Restricted Stock Units are replaced by a Replacement Award and you incur a Termination of Employment during the two years following a Change of Control by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason, such Replacement Award shall vest in full and be settled within six weeks following your Termination of Employment.  
       
           5.  
    Dividend Equivalents  . You are entitled to receive dividend equivalents on the Restricted Stock Units generally in the same manner and at the same time as if each Restricted Stock Unit were a Share. These dividend equivalents will be credited to you in the form of additional Restricted Stock Units. The additional Restricted Stock Units will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. 
       
           6.    
    Withhold Taxes  . You are responsible to promptly pay any Social Security and Medicare taxes (together,  FICA ) due upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, and any Federal, State, and local taxes due upon distribution of the Shares. The Company and its Subsidiaries are authorized to deduct from any payment to you any such taxes required to be withheld. As described in Section 15.4 of the Plan and to the extent permissible under applicable law, you may elect to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units to satisfy all or part of the withholding tax requirements. You may also elect, at the time you vest in the Restricted Stock Units, to pay your FICA liability due with respect to those Restricted Stock Units out of those units. If you choose to do so, the Company will reduce the number of your vested Restricted Stock Units accordingly. The amount that is applied to pay FICA will be subject to Federal, State, and local taxes. 
       
           7.  
    Limitation of Rights  . Except as set forth in the Agreement, until the Shares are issued to you in settlement of your Restricted Stock Units, you do not have any right in, or with respect to, any Shares (including any voting rights) by reason of this Agreement. Further, you may not transfer or assign your rights under the Agreement and you do not have any rights in the Company s assets that are superior to a general, unsecured creditor of the Company by reason of this Agreement. 
       
           8.  
    No Employment Contract  . Nothing contained in the Plan or Agreement creates any right to your continued employment or otherwise affects your status as an employee at will. You hereby acknowledge that the Company and you each have the right to terminate your employment at any time for any reason or for no reason at all. 
       
           9.   
    Amendment to Agreement Under Section 409A of the Code  . You acknowledge that the Agreement and the Plan are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and that changes may need to be made to the Agreement to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. You agree that following the issuance of such rules, the Company may amend this Agreement as it deems necessary or desirable to avoid such adverse tax consequences; provided, however, that the Company shall accomplish such amendments in a manner that preserves your intended benefits under the Agreement to the greatest extent possible. 
       
           10.    
    Agreement  . You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. Your signature is not required in order to make this Agreement effective. You are deemed to consent to the application of all of the terms  

and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan unless you contact HROC-Stock Administration at the address set forth below in writing within thirty (30) days of receiving the grant package. Receipt by the Company of your non-consent will nullify this award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by you and the Company. 
    
  Accompanying this Agreement are instructions for accessing the Plan and the Plan Summary (prospectus) from the Administrator s Internet website or HROC-Stock Administration s intranet website. You may also request written copies by contacting HROC-Stock Administration at 763.514.1500.

              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.

              2.

              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and  
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
