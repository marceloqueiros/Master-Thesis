 Explanatory Note 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K is a combined annual report being filed separately by two registrants: Allergan plc and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Warner Chilcott Limited. Each registrant hereto is filing on its own behalf all the information contained in this annual report that relates to such registrant. Each registrant hereto is not filing any information that does not relate to such registrant, and therefore makes no representations as to any such information. 
 Company History 
 Allergan plc (formerly known as Actavis plc) was incorporated in Ireland on May 16, 2013 as a private limited company and re-registered effective September 20, 2013 as a public limited company. It was established for the purpose of facilitating the business combination between Allergan Finance, LLC (formerly known as Actavis, Inc.) and Warner Chilcott plc ( Warner Chilcott ). On October 1, 2013, pursuant to the transaction agreement dated May 19, 2013 among Allergan Finance, LLC, Warner Chilcott, Actavis plc (now known as Allergan plc), Actavis Ireland Holding Limited, Actavis W.C. Holding LLC (now known as Actavis W.C. Holding Inc.) and Actavis W.C. Holding 2 LLC (now known as Actavis W.C. Holding 2 Inc.), (i) the Company acquired Warner Chilcott (the  Warner Chilcott Acquisition ) pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Section 201, and a capital reduction under Sections 72 and 74, of the Irish Companies Act of 1963, where each Warner Chilcott ordinary share was converted into 0.160 of an Allergan plc ordinary share (the  Company Ordinary Shares ), or $5,833.9 million in equity consideration, and (ii) Actavis W.C. Holding 2 Inc. merged with and into Allergan Finance, LLC, with Allergan Finance, LLC. as the surviving corporation in the merger (the  Merger  and, together with the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, the  Warner Chilcott Transactions ). Following the consummation of the Warner Chilcott Transactions, Allergan Finance, LLC and Warner Chilcott became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Allergan plc. Each of Allergan Finance, LLC s common shares was converted into one Company Ordinary Share. Effective October 1, 2013, through a series of related-party transactions, Allergan plc contributed its indirect subsidiaries, including Allergan Finance, LLC, to its subsidiary Warner Chilcott Limited. 
 Except where otherwise indicated, and excluding certain insignificant cash and non-cash transactions at the Allergan plc level, the consolidated financial statements and disclosures are for two separate registrants, Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. The results of Warner Chilcott Limited are consolidated into the results of Allergan plc. Due to the deminimis activity between Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited, references throughout this document relate to both Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. Refer to  Note 3  Reconciliation of Warner Chilcott Limited results to Allergan plc results  in the accompanying  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  in this document for a summary of the details on the differences between Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. 
 On March 17, 2015, the Company acquired Allergan, Inc. ( Legacy Allergan ) for approximately $77.0 billion including outstanding indebtedness assumed of $2.2 billion, cash consideration of $40.1 billion and equity consideration of $34.7 billion, which includes outstanding equity awards (the  Allergan Acquisition ). Under the terms of the agreement, Legacy Allergan shareholders received 111.2 million of the Company s ordinary shares, 7.0 million of the Company s non-qualified stock options and 0.5 million of the Company s share units. The addition of Legacy Allergan s therapeutic franchises in ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery complemented the Company s existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women s health and urology franchises. The combined company benefits from Legacy Allergan s global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox    and Restasis   . The transaction expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America. 
 In connection with the Allergan Acquisition, the Company changed its name from Actavis plc to Allergan plc.  Actavis plc s ordinary shares were traded on the NYSE under the symbol  ACT  until the opening of trading on June 15, 2015, at which time Actavis plc changed its corporate name to  Allergan plc  and changed its ticker symbol to  AGN.   Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), Allergan plc is the successor issuer to Actavis plc s ordinary shares and Actavis plc s mandatory convertible preferred shares, both of which are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Allergan plc is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 On July 26, 2015 we entered into a master purchase agreement (the  Teva Agreement ), under which Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ( Teva ) agreed to acquire our global generic pharmaceuticals business and certain other assets (the  Teva Transaction ).  Upon the closing of the Teva Transaction on August 2, 2016, we received $33.3 billion in cash, net of cash acquired by Teva,  which included estimated working capital and other contractual adjustments,  and 100.3 million unregistered Teva ordinary shares (or American Depository Shares with respect thereto), which approximated $5.0 billion in value using the closing date Teva opening stock price discounted at a rate of 5.9 percent due to the lack of marketability.   
 As part of the Teva Transaction, Teva acquired our global generics business, including the United States ( US ) and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic research and development ( R D ) unit, our international over-the-counter ( OTC ) commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and certain established international brands.  
 On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business to Teva  for $500.0 million . Teva acquired our Anda Distribution business, which distributes generic, branded, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from more than 300 manufacturers to retail independent and chain pharmacies, nursing homes, mail order pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and physician offices across the US  
 The Company recognized a combined gain on the sale of our Anda Distribution business and the sale of our global generics business of $15,932.2 million as well as deferred liabilities relating to other elements of our arrangements with Teva of $299.2 million. 
 As a result of the Teva Transaction and the divestiture of the Company s Anda Distribution business, and in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) number 2014-08  Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity , the Company is accounting for the assets and liabilities divested as held for sale as of December 31, 2015.  Further, the financial results of the businesses held for sale have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.  The results of our discontinued operations include the results of our generic product development, manufacturing and distribution of off-patent pharmaceutical products, certain established international brands marketed similarly to generic products and out-licensed generic pharmaceutical products primarily in Europe through our Medis third-party business through August 2, 2016, as well as our Anda Distribution business through October 3, 2016.   
 This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others, those identified under  Risk Factors  in this Annual Report and in other reports we have filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the decision was made to hold these assets for sale as one complete unit, without integrating the unit and realizing anticipated synergies. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized an impairment on assets held for sale of $189.9 million (the  Pharmatech Transaction ) which included a portion of goodwill allocated to this business unit.

 Business Description   
 Prescription pharmaceutical products in the United States generally are marketed as either brand pharmaceuticals or generics. Results in continuing operations in the United States are primarily due to brand pharmaceuticals. Brand pharmaceutical products, including aesthetic products, are marketed under brand names through programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty.  
 9 

As a result of the differences between the types of products we market and/or distribute, we operate and manage our business in three distinct operating segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. The operating segments are organized as follows:  

The US Specialized Therapeutics segment includes sales and expenses relating to certain branded products within the US, including Medical Aesthetics, Medical Dermatology, Eye Care, Neurosciences and Urology therapeutic products.     

The US General Medicine segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US that do not fall into the US Specialized Therapeutics business units, including Central Nervous System, Gastrointestinal, Women s Health, Anti-Infectives and Diversified Brands.     

The International segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside the US.     

 Business Strategy 
 We apply three key strategies to achieve growth for our US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International businesses: (i) internal development of differentiated and high-demand products, (ii) establishment of strategic alliances and collaborations and (iii) acquisition of products and companies that complement our current business.  
 Based upon business conditions, our financial strength and other factors, we regularly reexamine our business strategies and may change them at any time. Refer to  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Risks Related to Our Business  in this document.

Net revenues in our US Specialized Therapeutics segment were $5,811.7 million, $4,309.8 million, and $111.9 million or approximately 39.9%, 34.0%, and 2.4% of our total net revenues, in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The US Specialized Therapeutics segment is primarily attributable to the Allergan Acquisition. Revenues within this segment include revenues that were distributed through the Anda Distribution business to third party customers through October 3, 2016. 
 11 

US Specialized Therapeutics   Strategy   
 Our US Specialized Therapeutics business is focused on maintaining a leading position in the therapeutic areas in which we participate within the US market. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeted activities, including direct-to-consumer advertising, to increase consumer awareness of our products and also to engage specialty physicians and surgeons through our sales professionals and other programs to ensure they are fully informed about our product offerings. For reimbursed products we also contract with payors to ensure that our products are widely available to patients. 
 US General Medicine  
 Our US General Medicine business is focused on newly developed pharmaceutical products, which are normally patented or have market exclusivity. These patented and off-patent trademarked products are branded pharmaceutical products, and as a result of these patents or exclusivity, are generally offered by a single provider when first introduced to the market. We market a number of branded products to physicians, hospitals, and other customers that we serve. 
 Net revenues in our US General Medicine segment were $5,923.9 million, $6,338.4 million, and $4,399.3 million, or approximately 40.7%, 50.0%, and 94.1% of our total net revenues, in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Revenues within this segment include revenues that were distributed through the Anda Distribution business to third party customers through October 3, 2016. 
 US General Medicine Strategy  
 We market our branded products through our active sales professionals in the United States. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on both general practitioners and specialty physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of particular medical conditions.  We also conduct targeted activities, including direct-to-consumer advertising, to increase consumer awareness of our products. We believe that our current sales force structure gives us a competitive advantage in launching and promoting products due to our ability to reach a larger target audience of both general practitioners and specialists. For reimbursed products we also contract with payors to ensure that our products are widely available to patients. 
 International 
 Our International segment offers a wide array of branded and aesthetics products outside of the United States, primarily products acquired in the Allergan Acquisition. Net revenues in our International segment were $2,881.3 million, $2,187.3 million, and $203.5 million, or approximately 19.8%, 17.2% and 4.4% of our total net revenues, in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  
 International Strategy  
 Our International business is focused on maintaining a leading position by offering a consistent and reliable supply of quality branded and aesthetic products. We have maintained an ongoing effort to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs in our manufacturing operations.  
 Research and Development 
 We devote significant resources to the R D of branded products, biosimilars and proprietary drug delivery technologies. R D activities are expensed as incurred and consist of self-funded R D costs, the costs associated with work performed under collaborative R D agreements, regulatory fees, and acquisition and license related milestone payments, if any.  
   
 Our R D strategy focuses on the following product development areas: 

the application of proprietary drug-delivery technology for new product development in specialty areas;     

the acquisition of mid-to-late development-stage brand drugs and biosimilars; and     

the development of sustained-release, semi-solid, liquid, oral transmucosal, transdermal, gel, injectable, and other drug delivery technologies and the application of these technologies to proprietary drug forms.     

 As of December 31, 2016, we conducted the majority of our branded drug delivery R D activities in Irvine, California. We are presently developing a number of products through a combination of internal and collaborative programs.

 Financial Information About Segments and Geographic Areas 
 During 2016, Allergan announced a realignment of its businesses to streamline operations. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as four distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International and Anda Distribution. Under the new organizational structure being reported, and as a result of our decision to sell our Anda Distribution business, the Company organized its businesses into the following segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs, and the results of corporate initiatives, are managed outside of the three segments.  Prior period results have been recast to align to the current segment presentation. 
 The operating segments are organized as follows: 

The US Specialized Therapeutics segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US, including Medical Aesthetics, Medical Dermatology, Eye Care, Neurosciences and Urology therapeutic products.     

The US General Medicine segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US that do not fall into the US Specialized Therapeutics business units, including Central Nervous System, Gastrointestinal, Women s Health, Anti-Infectives and Diversified Brands.     

The International segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside the US.     

 The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for our segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (defined below), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. Included in segment revenues are product sales that were sold through the Anda Distribution business once the Anda Distribution business had sold the product to a third party customer. These sales are included in segment results and are reclassified into revenues from discontinued operations through a reduction of Corporate revenues which eliminates the sales made by the Anda Distribution business through October 3, 2016 from results of continuing operations.  Cost of sales for these products in discontinued operations is equal to our average third party cost of sales for third party branded products distributed by Anda Distribution. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level: 

Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales, selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs.     

General and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including certain expenses located within the United States.     

Total assets including capital expenditures.     

Other select revenues and operating expenses including R D expenses, amortization, IPR D impairments and asset sales and impairments, net as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments.       

 13 

The Company defines segment net revenues as product sales and other revenue derived from branded products or licensing agreements. In March 2015, as a result of the Allergan Acquisition, we began to promote Restasis       , Lumigan       /Ganfort       , Alphagan       /Combigan       , Botox       , fillers, other aesthetic products and other eye care products. In July 2014, as a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company also began recognizing revenues on key US brands, including, but not limited to, Bystolic        , Canasa       , Carafate       , Fetzima        , Linzess        , Namenda       IR (which lost exclusivity in July 2015), Namenda XR       , Saphris       , Teflaro        and Viibryd       .  
 Cost of sales within segment contribution includes standard production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements and finished goods inventory reserve charges.  Cost of sales included within segment contribution does not include non-standard production costs, such as non-finished goods inventory obsolescence charges, manufacturing variances and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles. 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.  
 General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.  
 Customers 
 In US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International operations, we sell our brand and aesthetic pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers, retailers and distributors, including national retail drug and food store chains, hospitals, clinics, mail order retailers, government agencies and managed healthcare providers such as health maintenance organizations and other institutions.  
 Sales to certain of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our annual revenues during the past three years. The following table illustrates customers and the respective percentage of revenues which they comprised in each of the last three years: 

Our significant customers comprise a large part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in North America. As a result, a small number of large wholesaler distributors control a significant share of the market for our products.  
 The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. In our US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International businesses, we compete with different companies to develop competitive products, in certain product categories, and within each applicable product category, upon dosage strengths and drug delivery systems. Our competitors include the major brand name manufacturers of pharmaceutical products. In addition to product development, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product quality, price, reputation, service and access to proprietary and technical information. It is possible that developments by others will make our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. 
 Competing in the brand and aesthetic product business requires us to identify and successfully bring to market new products embodying technological innovations. Successful marketing of brand and aesthetic products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of these products to healthcare professionals in private practice and group practices and to receive formulary status from managed care organizations. We anticipate that our brand and aesthetic product offerings will support our existing areas of therapeutic focus. Based upon business conditions and other factors, we regularly reevaluate our business strategies and may from time to time reallocate our resources from one therapeutic area to another, withdraw from a therapeutic area or add an additional therapeutic area in order to maximize our overall growth opportunities.

Many of our competitors have been in business for a longer period of time, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. When we directly compete with these companies for certain contracted business or for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent us from capturing a meaningful share of those markets.  
 Social Contract 
 In September 2016, we introduced our Social Contract with Patients, in which we committed to limit price increases on our products to once per year, and to only increase the list price of a product by single-digits, with the expectation that net price increases, which are price increases after discounts and rebates, would be in the low to mid- single digit range.  
 For the full-year 2016, our net price increases on US products averaged 4.8 percent (list price increases averaged 8.1 percent). 
 Manufacturing, Suppliers and Materials 
 As of December 31, 2016, we manufactured many of our own finished products at our plants which include major manufacturing sites in:

We have development and manufacturing capabilities for raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API ) and intermediate ingredients to support our R D internal product development efforts in our San Jose, California facility.  
 Our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulatory oversight and could be interrupted at any time. Refer to  Legal Matters  in  NOTE 24   Commitments and Contingencies  in the accompanying  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in this document. 
 In addition, we are dependent on third parties for the supply of the raw materials necessary to develop and manufacture our products, including the API and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients used in many of our products. We are required to identify the supplier(s) of all the raw materials for our products in the drug applications that we file with the FDA. If raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier specified in a drug application, we would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA, which could interrupt manufacturing of the affected product. To the extent practicable, we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application. However, some raw materials are available only from a single source and, in many of our drug applications, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified, even in instances where multiple sources exist. 
 Furthermore, we obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from foreign suppliers. Arrangements with international raw material suppliers are subject to, among other things, FDA regulation, customs clearance, various import duties, foreign currency risk and other government clearances. Acts of governments outside the US may affect the price or availability of raw materials needed for the development or manufacture of our products. In addition, any changes in patent laws in jurisdictions outside the US may make it increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials for R D prior to the expiration of the applicable US or foreign patents. Refer to  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Risks Related to Our Business   If we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key manufacturing sites or suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials, our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded  in this document and  ITEM 1A   RISK FACTORS   Risks Relating to Investing in the Pharmaceutical Industry   The supply of APIs into Europe may be negatively affected by recent regulations promulgated by the European Union  in this document.

Patents and Proprietary Rights  
 We believe patent protection of our proprietary products is important to our products. Our success with our branded products will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, and successfully defend if challenged, patent or other proprietary protection for such products. We currently have a number of US and foreign patents issued or pending. However, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent. Accordingly, our patents may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents. If our patent applications are not approved or, even if approved, if such patents are circumvented or not upheld in a court of law or in administrative proceedings, including oppositions, re-examinations or inter partes review ( IPR ), our ability to competitively market our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced. Also, such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, in which case our ability to commercially market these products may be diminished. From time to time, we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially market such products may be inhibited or prevented. In addition, patents covering, for example, Actonel    (certain indications), Aczone    5%, Androderm   , Botox     (for hyperhidrosis), Carafate   , Estrace    Cream, Femhrt   , INFed    and Namenda    (IR) products have expired and we have no further patent protection on these products, and generic versions of our Minastrin    product will enter the market as early as March 2017 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into. 
 We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our partners, customers, employees and consultants. It is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance, and we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. 
 We may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation concerning patents, trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and, as with litigation generally, the outcome is inherently uncertain. 
 Litigation alleging infringement of patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights may be costly and time consuming. Refer to  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Risks Related to Our Business   Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products  and  Legal Matters  in  NOTE 24   Commitments and Contingencies  in the accompanying  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in this document. 
 Government Regulation and Regulatory Matters 
 The following discussion focuses on key markets to the Company s overall business. 
 United States  
 All pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Allergan, are subject to extensive, complex and evolving regulation by the federal government, principally the FDA, and to a lesser extent, by the US Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ), Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state government agencies, as well as by various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. In our international markets, the approval, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products is similar to the United States with some variations dependent upon local market dynamics. 
 Specialty Pharmaceuticals 
 In the United States, FDA approval is required before any dosage form of any new drug, including an off-patent equivalent of a previously approved drug, can be marketed. The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time-consuming and costly, and the extent to which it may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments cannot be predicted. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping new products. Refer to  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Risks Related to Our Business   If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer  and    Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities  in this document. 
 16 

All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. We file a New Drug Application ( NDA ) when we seek approval for drugs with active ingredients and/or with dosage strengths, dosage forms, delivery systems or pharmacokinetic profiles that have not been previously approved by the FDA. Generally, NDAs are filed for newly developed branded products or for a new dosage form of previously approved drugs.  
 For innovative or non-generic new drugs, an FDA-approved NDA is required before the drug may be marketed in the United States. The NDA must contain data to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective for its intended uses and that it will be manufactured to appropriate quality standards. In order to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, an NDA generally must include or reference pre-clinical studies and clinical data from controlled trials in humans. For a new chemical entity, this generally means that lengthy, uncertain and rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing must be conducted. For compounds that have a record of prior or current use, it may be possible to utilize existing data or medical literature and limited new testing to support an NDA. Any pre-clinical testing that we wish to rely upon for FDA action must comply with the FDA s good laboratory practice and other requirements. Clinical testing in human subjects must be conducted in accordance with the FDA s good clinical practice and other requirements. In order to initiate a clinical trial, the sponsor must submit an Investigational New Drug Application ( IND ) to the FDA or meet one of the narrow exemptions that exist from the IND requirement. 
 The FDA has the authority to either approve or not approve NDAs, and if an application is not approved, additional data (clinical, non-clinical, manufacturing or quality data, among other types of data) is generally required. In addition, the FDA may approve an NDA subject to post-approval studies or monitoring requirements, or require that other risk management measures be utilized in connection with the product. There are also requirements to conduct pediatric trials for all new NDAs and supplements to NDAs for pharmaceutical products that may be used in the pediatric patient population, unless a waiver or deferral applies. 
 Once approved, the NDA is subject to life-cycle management regulations (for example, supplemental applications and annual reports) in order to maintain product registrations. Supplemental NDAs are required for changes that require FDA evaluation and/or approval prior to implementation, including the transfer of certain products from one manufacturing site to another, a change in API supplier, or a new indication or dosage form, and may be under review for a year or more. In addition, certain products may only be approved for transfer once new bioequivalency studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied. In addition, FDA may require post-marketing clinical studies. 
 To obtain FDA approval of NDAs and supplemental New Drug Applications ( sNDA ), our manufacturing procedures and operations must conform to FDA quality system and control requirements generally referred to as current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP ), as defined in Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations, and cGMP must be adhered to throughout the life-cycle of a product, as these regulations encompass all aspects of the production process from receipt and qualification of components to distribution procedures for finished products. cGMP standards are evolving standards; thus, we must continue to expend substantial time, money and effort in all production and quality control areas to maintain compliance with these standards. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in the continuing possibility that we may be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite our efforts to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. 
 We are subject to the periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our products by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to assess compliance with applicable regulations. In addition, in connection with its review of our applications for new products, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes comply with cGMP and other FDA regulations. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs, sNDAs, or other product applications of a facility if deficiencies are found at that facility. Vendors that supply finished products or components to us that we use to manufacture, package and label products are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections. 
 Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. A Form 483 notice may be issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection and lists conditions the FDA investigators believe may violate cGMP or other FDA regulations. FDA guidelines specify that a Warning Letter be issued only for violations of  regulatory significance  for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. 
   Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA s review of NDAs or other product application enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Although we have internal compliance programs, if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could have a material adverse  
 17 

effect on us. Refer to  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Risks Related to Our Business   Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.  in this document. The FDA can also significantly delay the approval of any pending NDA or other regulatory submissions under the Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery and Illegal Gratuities Policy Act.  
 Medical Devices  
 Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health agencies in the US. FDA regulations, as well as various US federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products. Our medical device product candidates, including our breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for approvals, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale, use or their withdrawal from the market.  
 Our medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we market in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III.   In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA application, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of our medical device products, including our breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices.   A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors or other third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMAs that are already granted; and criminal prosecution. 
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption, which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound, as well as approval by the FDA and the IRB overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the applicable device.  
 Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk.  Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or  off-label  uses along with other labeling restrictions.  If a manufacturer or distributor fails to comply with any of these regulatory requirements, or if safety concerns with a device arise, the FDA may take legal or regulatory action, including civil or criminal penalties, suspension, withdrawal or delay in the issuance of approvals, or seizure or recall of products, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon us.  
   The FDA imposes a number of complex regulatory requirements on entities that advertise and promote medical devices, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities including internet marketing. Medical devices can only be marketed for indications approved or cleared by the FDA. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties, the issuance of warning  
 18 

letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.   
 US government reimbursement programs include Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare, and State Pharmacy Assistance Programs established according to statute, government regulations and policy. Federal law requires that all pharmaceutical manufacturers, as a condition of having their products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on units of their pharmaceuticals that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. With enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the  ACA ), for products marketed under NDAs, the manufacturers rebate increased from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price, or the difference between the average manufacturer price and the lowest net sales price to a non-government customer during a specified period. In some states, supplemental rebates are required as a condition of including the manufacturer s drug on the state s Preferred Drug List. 
 The ACA prescribed that the coverage gap phase of the Medicare Part D benefit be closed such that by 2020, beneficiaries will pay co-insurance of 25% (or co-payment equivalents) of the cost of prescription drugs dispensed to them under their applicable Medicare Part D plans, until they reach the catastrophic phase of the Medicare Part D benefit.  As such, the coverage gap or  donut hole  will be effectively closed beginning in the 2020 plan year.  The cost of closing the donut hole is being borne in part by brand drug companies as well as Medicare Part D plan sponsors and the federal government. Beginning in 2011, brand drug manufacturers were required to provide a 50% discount on their drugs. Additionally, beginning in 2013, the government/Medicare Part D plan sponsors began providing additional subsidies for brand name drugs bought by seniors who enter the coverage gap. When the government/sponsor share, which started at 2.5%, but increases to 25% by 2020, the combined industry discounts and government subsidies will add up to 75% of brand name drug costs. 
 On January 21, 2016, the Center for Medical Services issued final rules on the calculation of AMP, Best Price and Unit Rebate Amounts for the Medicaid program; the final rule took effect in April 2016.  Allergan has implemented the required changes to its Medicaid rebate calculations, effective with its Q2 2016 submissions. 
 The ACA also expanded the government s 340B drug discount program by increasing the category of entities qualified to participate in the program and benefit from its deeply discounted drug pricing.  The ACA also obligates the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which administers the 340B program, to update the agreement that each manufacturer must sign to participate in the 340B program to require each manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug product available to any other purchaser at any price, and to report the ceiling prices for its drugs to the government.  HRSA issued this update in late 2016 and the Company signed subsequently executed an amendment to our agreement.  In addition, on January 5, 2017, HRSA finalized regulations that, among other things, implement rules regarding civil monetary penalties for knowing and intentional overcharges of 340B covered entities by pharmaceutical manufacturers effective March 6, 2017, subject to the 60-day  regulatory freeze  executive order issued by the Trump Administration on January 20, 2017. 
 HRSA also has issued proposed regulations to implement an administrative dispute resolution process for certain disputes arising under the 340B program, including (1) claims by covered entities that they have been overcharged for covered outpatient drugs by manufacturers; and (2) claims by manufacturers, after a manufacturer has conducted an audit, that a covered entity has violated the prohibition on diversion to ineligible patients or duplicate discounts.  The exact timing and content of final guidance on these matters is uncertain at this time, particularly in light of the Trump Administration s  one in, two out  executive order issued on January 30, 2017. Depending on their final form, these actions could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways that may have an adverse impact on our business.  In addition, in connection with the commercialization of our products, we have obtained authorization to receive reimbursement at varying levels for the cost of certain products and related treatments from government authorities and private health insurers and other organizations, such as Health Maintenance Organizations and Managed Care Organizations.    
 Additionally, we may in the future, and have in the past, received requests for information, sometimes in the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas, from the FTC and the European Competition Commission, and are subject to ongoing FTC and European Competition Commission investigations.  Any adverse outcome of these types of investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Risks Related to Our Business Federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of brand and generic products could adversely affect our business.  Also refer to  Legal Matters  in  NOTE 24   Commitments and Contingencies  in the accompanying  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in this document. 
   As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ), companies are required to file with the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Department of Justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of brand drugs. This requirement could affect the manner in which drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with competitor  
 19 

pharmaceutical companies, and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies. The impact of this requirement, and the potential private-party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers, is uncertain and could adversely affect our business. For example, in January 2009, the FTC and the State of California filed a lawsuit against us alleging that our settlement with Solvay related to our ANDA for a generic version of Androgel        is unlawful. Beginning in February 2009, several private parties purporting to represent various classes of plaintiffs filed similar lawsuits. Those lawsuits, as well as additional suits challenging the validity of our settlements related to Asacol       , Namenda        and Loestrin        24 and generic versions of Actos       , Cipro       , and Lidoderm       , remain pending.    Refer to   Legal Matters   in  NOTE 24   Commitments and Contingencies  in the accompanying  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in this document.  
 Federal, state, local and foreign laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, also govern us. In addition, we are subject, as are all manufacturers generally, to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water. Environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities. We could be adversely affected by any failure to comply with environmental laws, including the costs of undertaking a clean-up at a site to which our wastes were transported. 
 European Union 
 We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are regulated in the European Union (the  EU ) by the European Medicines Agency (the  EMA ) and national health authorities. All manufacturers are required to submit medicinal products, including generic versions of previously approved products and new strengths, dosages and formulations of previously approved products, to the EMA and its member states for review and marketing authorization before such products are placed on the market in the EU. 
 Marketing authorizations are granted to applicants after the relevant health authority issues a positive assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of the product. In order to receive such assessment, applicants must submit applications, which must contain the results of pre-clinical tests, pharmaceutical tests, and clinical trials with respect to original products, or originator data with respect to the generic versions of previously approved products. All of these tests or trials must be conducted in accordance within European regulations and must allow the reviewing body to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. 
 In addition to obtaining marketing authorization for each product, all member states require that a manufacturer s facilities obtain approval from the national authority. The EU has a code of good manufacturing practices that each manufacturer must follow and comply with. Regulatory authorities in the EU may conduct inspections of the manufacturing facilities to review procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. Refer to  ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS   Risks Related to Our Business   The supply of APIs into Europe may be negatively affected by recent regulations promulgated by the European Union  in this document. 
 In the EU, member states regulate the pricing of pharmaceutical products, and in some cases, the formulation and dosing of products. This regulation is handled by individual member state national health services. These individual regulatory bodies can result in considerable price differences and product availability among member states. The implementation of tendering systems for the pricing of pharmaceuticals in several countries generally impacts drug pricing for generics; generally  tendering  refers to a system that requires bids to be submitted to the government by competing manufacturers to be the exclusive, or one of a few, supplier(s) of a product in a particular country. 
 Further, faced with major budget constraints, many European countries have resorted to price cuts that affect both innovative and generic pharmaceuticals. Refer to  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Risks Related to Our Business Global economic conditions could harm us  in this document.  
 Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Directive, (the  MDD ), as implemented in the national legislation of the European Union member states. The MDD, as implemented, provides for a regulatory regime with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDD, as implemented, are entitled to bear a CE marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect our ability to market and sell our products in these countries. 
 20 

Canada  
 In Canada, pharmaceutical manufacturers are regulated by the Therapeutic Products Directorate (the  TPD ) which derives its authority from the Canadian federal government under the Food and Drugs Act and the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The TPD evaluates and monitors the safety, effectiveness and quality of pharmaceutical products. Products are officially approved for marketing in Canada following receipt of a market authorization, or  Notice of Compliance  (a  NOC ), which is subject to the Food and Drug Regulations. Issuance of a NOC for generic drug products is also subject to the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations (the  NOC Regulations ) under the Patent Act. 
 The NOC Regulations allow branded drug marketers to list patents relating to the medicinal ingredient, formulation, dosage form or the use of the medicinal ingredient in their branded drug on a patent register maintained by Health Canada. In its abbreviated new drug submission, a generic applicant must address each patent listed against the reference product by making at least one statutory allowed allegation (for example, alleging that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed). If the generic applicant alleges invalidity or non-infringement, it must provide the branded manufacturer with an explanation of its allegations. Upon receipt of the explanation, the branded manufacturer may apply to the Federal Court of Canada for an Order prohibiting Health Canada from issuing a NOC for the generic. Health Canada may not issue a NOC until the earlier of the determination of the application by the court after a hearing on the allegations, or the expiration of 24 months from the commencement of the application. 
 Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by Health Canada and the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate. In addition, Health Canada conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems are in compliance with the good manufacturing practices in Canada, Drug Establishment Licensing requirements and other provisions of the NOC Regulations. Competitors are subject to similar regulations and inspections. 
 Each Canadian province also provides a comprehensive public drug program, which controls drug pricing and reimbursement and is responsible for ensuring eligible patients receive drugs through public funding. The provinces and territories in Canada operate drug benefit programs through which eligible recipients receive drugs through public funding; these drugs are listed on provincial or territorial Drug Benefit Formularies ( Formularies ). Eligible recipients include seniors, persons on social assistance, low-income earners, and those with certain specified conditions or diseases. Formulary listings are also used by private payors to reimburse generic products. To be listed in a Formulary, drug products must have been issued a NOC and must comply with each jurisdiction s individual review process. Currently, Canada s provinces are looking at national competitive bidding processes/tendering of drugs, which may affect the sustainability of the industry and the supply of pharmaceuticals. 
 Finally, Canada has reached a trade agreement in principle with the European Union ( CETA ) in which it has agreed to implement patent term extensions and certain procedural amendments to the NOC Regulations. Canada is further involved in trade negotiations with ten Pacific countries (the  Trans Pacific Partnership ), which could lead to further changes to Canada s intellectual property framework and affect our business. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations in the United States and abroad. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we have a business presence, and we periodically audit our manufacturing and R D facilities for compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we continue to make capital expenditures for environmental protection, we do not anticipate any significant expenditure in order to comply with such laws and regulations that would have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position. We are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We cannot assure you, however, that environmental problems relating to facilities owned or operated by us will not develop in the future, and we cannot predict whether any such problems, if they were to develop, could require significant expenditures on our part. In addition, we are unable to predict what legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future with respect to environmental protection and waste disposal. Refer to  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Risks Related to Our Business   Our business will continue to expose us to risks of environmental liabilities  in this document. 
 Seasonality 
 Consistent with the United States pharmaceutical industry, our business experiences seasonality with the first quarter of each year typically being the lowest revenue quarter for branded products.  In addition, our aesthetics products, including our breast aesthetics and Botox    cosmetic indications, have tended to be marginally higher during the second and fourth quarters, presumably in advance of the summer vacation and holiday seasons. Fluctuations of our sales are also impacted by the effect of promotions, which cause non-seasonal variability in sales trends. 
 21 

Backlog  
 As a result of the extent of our supply chain, backlog of orders is not material to our business. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 16,700 employees. Of our employees, approximately 2,100 were engaged to support R D functions, 4,200 supported COGS functions, 9,000 supported sales, marketing and distribution functions, and 1,400 supported administrative functions.

ITEM 1A.   
 
            RI  SK FACTORS     

 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Any statements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact or that refer to estimated or anticipated future events are forward looking statements.  We have based our forward looking statements on management s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time these statements are made.  Such forward looking statements reflect our current perspective of our business, future performance, existing trends and information as of the date of this filing.  These include, but are not limited to, our beliefs about future revenue and expense levels and growth rates, prospects related to our strategic initiatives and business strategies, including the integration of, and synergies associated with, strategic acquisitions, express or implied assumptions about government regulatory action or inaction, anticipated product approvals and launches, business initiatives and product development activities, assessments related to clinical trial results, product performance and competitive environment, and anticipated financial performance.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as  may,   will,   expect,   believe,   anticipate,   plan,   intend,   could,   would,   should,   estimate,   continue,  or  pursue,  or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology, are intended to identify forward looking statements.  The statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.  We caution the reader that these statements are based on certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  In addition, certain important factors may affect our actual operating results and could cause such results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements.  We believe the risks and uncertainties discussed under the section entitled  Risks Related to Our Business,  and other risks and uncertainties detailed herein and from time to time in our SEC filings, may cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statement.  
 We disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.  This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  
 We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.  The following discussion highlights some of these risks and speaks as of the date of this document, including the assets held for sale.  These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Global economic conditions could harm us.   
 While global economic conditions have been fairly stable as a whole in recent years, continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential geopolitical issues and economic policy uncertainty, particularly in areas in which we operate, could potentially cause economic and market instability in the future and could adversely affect the Company s business, including the Company s financial performance.   
 Challenging economic conditions could result in tighter credit conditions. The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which could adversely affect the ability of third-party distributors, partners, manufacturers and suppliers to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations, and which could adversely affect the liquidity and financial conditions of our customers. 
 Global efforts towards health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. In many international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of patented drugs. Some countries may be subject to periods of financial instability or may have reduced resources to spend on healthcare or may be or will be in the future subject to economic sanctions, and our business in these countries may be disproportionately affected by these changes. In addition, the currencies of some countries may depreciate against the US Dollar substantially and if the Company is unable to offset the impact of such depreciation, then the Company s financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.  
 If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer.  
 Our future results of operations depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products in a timely manner.  There are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products, including:   

developing, testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner;      

receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner, or at all;      

 23 

the availability, on commercially reasonable terms, of raw materials, including API and other key ingredients;      

preclusion from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others;      

developing products that are economical to manufacture and commercialize;      

time consuming and costly nature of developing and commercializing new products;      

costly legal actions brought by our competitors that may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of new products;      

delays as a result of limited resources at the FDA or other regulatory agencies;      

changing review and approval policies and standards at the FDA and other regulatory agencies; and     

completion of numerous other regulatory approvals in international markets.     

 As a result of these and other difficulties, products currently in development by us may or may not receive timely regulatory approvals necessary for marketing by us or other third party partners, or approvals at all.  This risk particularly exists with respect to the development of proprietary products because of the uncertainties, higher costs and lengthy time frames associated with R D of such products and the inherent unproven market acceptance of such products.  Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate as the amount we spend to research and develop, promote, acquire or license new products, technologies and businesses changes. Additionally, we face heightened risks in connection with our development of extended release or controlled release generic products because of the technical difficulties and regulatory requirements related to such products. If any of our products or the products of our third party partners are not approved in a timely manner or, when acquired or developed and approved, cannot be successfully manufactured or commercialized in a timely manner, our operating results could be adversely affected.  We cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing those products.  Refer to   Our branded pharmaceutical expenditures may not result in commercially successful products .   
 Our branded pharmaceutical expenditures may not result in commercially successful products.   
 Developing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical products is generally more costly than developing and commercializing generic products.  In order to grow and achieve success in our business, we must continually identify, develop, acquire and license new products that we can ultimately market. In the future, we anticipate continuing and increasing our product development expenditures.  There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, and there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development.  Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment.  New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and payer reimbursement, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others.  Products that do reach the market may ultimately be subject to recalls or other suspensions in sales.  Delays and uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity.  Because there is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process of new products, there is a significant risk that funds invested by the Company in research and development will not generate financial returns.  The Company cannot be certain when or whether any of its products currently under development will be approved or launched or whether, once launched, such products will be commercially successful.   
 We may be required to spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials.  The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of sites and subjects to participate in our trials.  Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals and delays in product candidates reaching the market.  We rely on independent third party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials in accordance with applicable study protocols and laws and regulations.  If regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the R D of a product candidate, they may refuse to accept trial data from the site and/or not approve the product candidate, and we would not be able to market and sell that product.  If we are not able to market and sell our products after significant expenditures to develop and test them, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.   
   We currently have products in various stages of development, including new hormonal contraceptive therapy, dermatology products and infectious disease products, among others.  Such clinical trials are costly and may not result in successful outcomes.  The results of preclinical studies and early clinical studies may not be predictive of the results of later stage clinical studies.  Product candidates that have shown promising results in early stage clinical studies may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent clinical studies.  There is a high rate of failure for products proceeding through clinical studies, and product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial  
 24 

clinical studies.  Clinical studies may not proceed as planned or be completed on schedule, if at all.  The rate of completion of clinical trials is significantly dependent upon a number of factors, including the rate of patient enrollment.  We may not be able to attract a sufficient number of sites or enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely manner in order to complete clinical trials.  Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and our data may not provide adequate efficacy and safety information to obtain regulatory approval of our candidates.  We cannot be sure that our business expenditures, including but not limited to our expenditures related to our Esmya  product, products acquired in the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, the Forest Acquisition and the Allergan Acquisition, or products of our third   party partners, among others, will result in the successful discovery, development or launch of branded products that will prove to be commercially successful or will improve the long   term profitability of our business.  If such business expenditures do not result in successful discovery, development or launch of commercially successful branded products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.    
 If generic products that compete with any of our branded pharmaceutical products are approved and sold, sales of our products will be adversely affected.   
 Generic equivalents for branded pharmaceutical products are typically sold at lower costs than the branded products. The regulatory approval process in the United States and European Union exempts generic products from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and rely instead on the safety and efficacy of prior products, manufacturers of generic products can invest far less in research and development.  After the introduction of a competing generic product, a significant percentage of the prescriptions previously written for the branded product are often written for the generic version.  In addition, legislation enacted in most US states and Canadian provinces allows or, in some instances mandates, that a pharmacist dispense an available generic equivalent when filling a prescription for a branded product, in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Hatch Waxman Act, manufacturers of branded products often bring lawsuits to enforce their patent rights against generic products released prior to the expiration of branded products  patents, but it is possible for generic manufacturers to offer generic products while such litigation is pending.  Refer to   If we are unable to adequately protect our   technology or enforce our patents, our business could suffer .   As a result, branded products typically experience a significant loss in revenues following the introduction of a competing generic product, even if subject to an existing patent.  Our branded pharmaceutical products are or may become subject to competition from generic equivalents because there is no proprietary protection for some of the branded pharmaceutical products we sell, because our patent protection expires or because our patent protection is not sufficiently broad or enforceable.  In addition, we may not be successful in our efforts to extend the proprietary protection afforded our branded products through the development and commercialization of proprietary product improvements.   
 Our Actonel      products no longer have patent protection in Canada or the Western European countries in which we sell these products, and Asacol      is not protected by a patent in the United Kingdom.  Our Actonel      once a month product lost US patent protection in June 2014 (including a 6 month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity) and generic versions of our Loestrin      24 Fe product entered the market in January 2014 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into.  Generic versions of Namenda    (IR) tablets entered the US market in July 2015 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into.  An authorized generic version of Asacol HD    entered the market in July 2016 pursuant to a settlement agreement previously entered into.   In addition, other products such as Estrace      Cream, Asacol      400 mg, Aczone 5%, Femhrt     , Latisse     , and Carafate      are not protected by patents in the United States where we sell these products.  Generic equivalents are currently available in Canada and Western Europe for Actonel      and in the United States for certain versions of our Femhrt      products, Femcon      Fe and certain other less significant products.   
 During the next few years, additional products of ours, including some of our large revenue drivers, like Aczone    5%, Bystolic   , Canasa   , Delzicol   , Gelnique   , Minastrin   , Namenda XR   , Pylera   , Rapaflo   , Saphris    and Viibryd   , will lose patent protection and/or likely become subject to generic or other competition.  Generic versions of our Canasa    product may enter the market as early as December 2018 or earlier pursuant to an agreement previously entered into and generic versions of our Minastrin    may enter the market as early as March 2017 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into.  Some of our products may also become subject to generic competition prior to the expiration of patent protection in the event a generic competitor elects to launch its generic equivalent product  at risk.   For example, before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has reviewed Allergan s appeal of a district court judgment of patent invalidity, Sandoz launched  at risk  a generic version of Latisse     in December 2016.   Competition from generic equivalents could result in a material impairment of our intangible assets or the acceleration of amortization on our non impaired intangible assets and may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and our future revenue growth and profitability are dependent on our timely development and launches of new products ahead of our competitors.   
   We face strong competition across our business.  The intensely competitive environment of the pharmaceutical industry requires an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovations and the ability to market and price products effectively, including the  
 25 

ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of branded products to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices and Managed Care Organizations.  Our competitors vary depending upon product categories, and within each product category, upon dosage strengths and drug   delivery systems.  Based on total assets, annual revenues, and market capitalization, we are smaller than certain of our national and international competitors in the brand and distribution product arenas.  Most of our competitors have been in business for a longer period of time than we have, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do.  Furthermore, recent trends in this industry are toward further market consolidation of large drug companies into a smaller number of very large entities, further concentrating financial, technical and market strength and increasing competitive pressure in the industry.  If we directly compete with them for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent us from capturing a profitable share of those markets.  It is possible that developments by our competitors will make our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete.  In addition, competitive forces may result in changes to the mix of products that we sell during a given time period or lower demand for our products than expected.    
 Some of our competitors have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes.  We face increased competition from new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, surgical support, cleaning consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, contract sterilization, and other products and services entering the market.  These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products that these competitors may bring to market.  As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, a better safety profile, are easier to administer, achieve earlier entry into the market or that are otherwise competitive with our products.   
 If we are unable to adequately protect our technology or enforce our patents, our business could suffer.   
 Our success with the branded products that we develop will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for these products.  We currently have a number of US and foreign patents issued and pending.  However, issuance of a patent is not conclusive evidence of its validity or enforceability.  We cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our pending patent applications or any patent applications we may file in the future, or that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged.  If our current and future patent applications are not approved or, if approved, our patents are not upheld in a court of law if challenged, it may reduce our ability to competitively utilize our patented products.  Also, such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, in which case our ability to commercially market these products may be diminished.  Patent disputes may be lengthy and a potential violator of our patents may bring a potentially infringing product to market during the dispute, subjecting us to competition and damages due to infringement of the competitor product.  For example, patents covering our Actonel    (certain indications), Aczone    5%, Androderm   , Carafate   , Estrace    Cream, Femhrt   , INFed    and Namenda    (IR) products have expired and we have no further patent protection on these products.  During the next few years, additional products acquired pursuant to the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, the Forest Acquisition, and the Allergan Acquisition will lose patent protection and/or likely become subject to generic or other competition, including Aczone    5%, Bystolic   , Canasa   , Delzicol   , Gelnique   , Minastrin   , Namenda XR   , Pylera   , Rapaflo   , Saphris    and Viibryd   .  Therefore, it is possible that a competitor may launch a generic version of any of these products at any time, which would result in a significant decline in that product s revenue and profit.    
 Generic versions of our Loestrin    24 Fe product entered the market in January 2014 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into; an authorized generic version of our Asacol    HD 800 mg product entered the market in August 2016 pursuant to an agreement previously entered into; our immediate release Namenda    product lost US patent protection in 2015 and generic versions entered the market in July 2015 pursuant to agreements previously entered into; generic versions of our Minastrin    product may enter the market as early as March 2017 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into; and generic versions of our Canasa    product may enter the market as early as December 2018 pursuant to a settlement agreement previously entered into.  Some of our products may also become subject to generic competition prior to the expiration of patent protection in the event a generic competitor elects to launch its generic equivalent product  at risk.   
   Generic competitors to our branded products may also challenge the validity or enforceability of the patents protecting our products or otherwise seek to circumvent them. Forest also recently brought actions against certain manufacturers of generic drugs for infringement of several patents covering our Canasa   , Delzicol   , Linzess   , Namenda XR   , Namzaric   , Pylera   , Saphris   , Savella   , Teflaro    and Viibryd    products.  Allergan recently brought actions against manufacturers of generic drugs in the United States for infringement of several patents covering our Acular LS   , Combigan   , Lastacaft   , Latisse   , and Restasis    products.  While we intend to vigorously defend these and other patents and pursue our legal rights, we can offer no assurance as to when the pending or any future litigation will be decided, whether such lawsuits will be successful or that a generic equivalent of one or more of our products will not be approved and enter the market.   In addition, patents covering our branded pharmaceutical products may be challenged in proceedings other than court proceedings, including inter partes review (IPR) at the US Patent Office.  In 2011, Congress amended the patent laws and created a new way to challenge the validity of patents:  the inter partes review.  IPR proceedings take place in the US Patent Office and have both advantages and disadvantages when compared to district court proceedings.  Although IPR proceedings  
 26 

are limited to certain types of invalidity challenges, the Patent Office applies different standards that make it easier for challengers to invalidate patents.  Moreover, IPR proceedings generally take no more than 18 months, which means it is much faster than challenging a patent s validity in a district court proceeding.  In addition, an IPR challenge can be mounted even after a patent has been upheld in court.  IPR challenges have recently been brought by Mylan against some or all of our patents covering our Restasis        and Delzicol        products.  For example, following Mylan s IPR challenge, the US Patent and Trial Appeal Board, in December 2016, instituted   inter     partes     review for all of our Orange Book-listed patents covering Restasis       .  And, in November 2016, Mylan filed an IPR challenge against our one Orange Book-listed patent covering Delzicol       .  
 In addition to patent protection, our business relies on our protection of other intellectual property rights, trade secrets, and other proprietary technologies.  We rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights.  The protection of our proprietary technology may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.  We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from misappropriating or infringing upon our proprietary rights.   
 We rely on certain information, processes, and know how that are not protected by patents or other intellectual property rights.  We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements, as well as through other measures.  These measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented technology.   
 If we are unable to adequately protect our technology, trade secrets or proprietary know how, or enforce our intellectual property rights, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could suffer.  
 From time to time we may need to rely on licenses to proprietary technologies, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain.   
 We may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market products.  If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially market our products may be inhibited or prevented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  For example, because we license significant intellectual property with respect to certain of our products, including Delzicol     , Namenda XR     , Namzaric     , Linzess     , Teflaro      and Viibryd     , any loss or suspension of our rights to licensed intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.   
 Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products.   
 The manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry.  These lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties.  We may have to defend ourselves against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties.  This is especially true in the case of new branded products where a competitor has obtained patents for similar products.  Litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time consuming, often involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel.  In addition, if it is determined that we infringe the rights of others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or market products, product launches could be delayed or we could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  As a result, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could result in substantial monetary damage awards and could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Certain aspects of our operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers.   
 We rely on suppliers, vendors and other third party service providers to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell our products.  Reliance on third party manufacturers reduces our oversight and control of the manufacturing process.  Some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks, and market risks of their own.  The failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results.  If any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to us, it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputation harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.  
 27 

If we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key manufacturing sites or suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials, our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded.    
 We are required to identify the supplier(s) of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the US  To the extent practicable, we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application.  However, some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and, in many of our drug applications, only one supplier of products and raw materials or site of manufacture has been identified, even in instances where multiple sources exist.  Some of these products have historically or may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenues, such as our products Botox   , our Juvederm    dermal filler family of products, Namenda     , Linzess     , Bystolic     , and a significant number of our oral contraceptive and controlled substance products.  In addition, certain manufacturing facilities in Ireland are the exclusive qualified manufacturing facilities for finished dosage forms of many of our products, including our products, Namenda     , Bystolic      and Linzess     .  Any failure by us to forecast demand for, or to maintain an adequate supply of, the raw material and finished product could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in sales of that product.  In addition, if our suppliers are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements, we may not be able to produce a sufficient amount of materials or products in a timely manner, which could cause a decline in our sales.  We expect to continue to rely on our third party manufacturing partners, such as Contract Pharmaceuticals Limited Canada for Estrace      Cream and Patheon for Viberzi     . Such transfers are subject to regulatory approvals, and the failure to obtain such approvals in a timely manner may delay production at the new facility and result in an interruption in our product supply.  From time to time, certain of our manufacturing sites or outside suppliers have experienced regulatory or supply related difficulties that have inhibited their ability to deliver products and raw materials to us, causing supply delays or interruptions.  The availability and prices of raw materials and supplies are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, product contamination, among other factors.  To the extent any difficulties experienced by our manufacturing sites or suppliers cannot be resolved or extensions of our key supply agreements cannot be negotiated within a reasonable time and on commercially reasonable terms, or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the FDA or other regulatory agency, or if we are unable to do so, our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease or be eliminated, as well as delay our development and sales and marketing efforts.  Such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   
 Our manufacturing sites outside of the United States and our arrangements with foreign suppliers are subject to certain additional risks, including the availability of government clearances, export duties, political instability, war, acts of terrorism, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the transfer of funds.  For example, we obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from foreign suppliers.  Arrangements with international raw material suppliers are subject to, among other things, FDA and foreign regulatory body regulation, customs clearances, various import duties and other government clearances, as well as potential shipping delays due to inclement weather, political instability, strikes or other matters outside of our control.  Acts of governments outside the US may affect the price or availability of raw materials needed for the development or manufacture of our products.  In addition, recent changes in patent laws in jurisdictions outside the US may make it increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials for R D prior to the expiration of the applicable US or foreign patents.   
 The design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties, and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain.   
 The design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity.  For example, Forest is subject to approximately 200 legal actions asserting product liability claims relating to the use of Celexa      or Lexapro     .  These cases include claims that Celexa      or Lexapro      caused various birth defects. While we believe there is no merit to these cases, litigation is inherently subject to uncertainties and we may be required to expend substantial amounts in the defense or resolution of certain of these matters.  We regularly monitor the use of our products for trends or increases in reports of adverse events or product complaints, and regularly report such matters to the FDA.  In some, but not all cases, an increase in adverse event reports may be an indication that there has been a change in a product s specifications or efficacy.  Such changes could lead to a recall of the product in question or, in some cases, increases in product liability claims related to the product in question.  If the coverage limits for product liability insurance policies are not adequate or if certain of our products are excluded from coverage, a claim brought against us, whether covered by insurance or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  We also rely on self insurance to cover product liability claims, and these claims may exceed amounts we have reserved under our self insurance program.   
   We are also subject to a variety of other types of claims, proceedings, investigations and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties.  These include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims  
 28 

regarding promotion of our products and services, or other similar matters.  For example, consumer groups and certain plaintiffs have alleged that certain uses of Botox       , including off-label uses, have caused patient injuries and death and have further failed to adequately warn patients of the risks relating to Botox        use.  From time to time reports related to the quality and safety of breast implant devices are published, including reports that have suggested a possible association between anaplastic large cell lymphoma and breast implants, as well as negative reports from regulatory authorities in Europe related to a breast implant manufacturer that is not affiliated with the Company.  In addition, government investigations related to the use of products, but not the efficacy themselves, may cause reputational harm to the Company.  Negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate, about the efficacy, safety or side effects of our products or product categories, whether involving us or a competitor, could materially reduce market acceptance to our products, cause consumers to seek alternatives to our products, result in product withdrawals and cause our stock price to decline.  Negative publicity could also result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not these claims have a basis in scientific fact.  Any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business.    
 Our business could suffer as a result of manufacturing difficulties or delays.   
 The manufacture of certain of our products and product candidates, particularly our controlled release products, transdermal products, injectable products, and our oral contraceptive products, is more difficult than the manufacture of immediate release products.  Successful manufacturing of these types of products requires precise manufacturing process controls, API that conforms to very tight tolerances for specific characteristics and equipment that operates consistently within narrow performance ranges.  Manufacturing complexity, testing requirements, and safety and security processes combine to increase the overall difficulty of manufacturing these products and resolving manufacturing problems that we may encounter.   
 Our manufacturing and other processes utilize sophisticated equipment, which sometimes require a significant amount of time to obtain and install.  Our business could suffer if certain manufacturing or other equipment, or a portion or all of our facilities were to become inoperable for a period of time.  This could occur for various reasons, including catastrophic events such as earthquake, monsoon, hurricane or explosion, unexpected equipment failures or delays in obtaining components or replacements thereof, contamination by microorganisms or viruses, labor disputes or shortages, contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers, as well as construction delays or defects and other events, both within and outside of our control.  We manufacture certain products, including Botox   , our Juvederm    dermal filler family of products, Linzess    and Bystolic   , at a single facility or a single site. Therefore, a significant disruptive event, including a fire or natural disaster, at certain manufacturing facilities or sites could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations as noted with our supply interruption with Avycaz    in 2016. In the event of a disruption, we may need to build or locate replacement facilities as well as seek and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for these facilities. Interruption of our efficient manufacture and supply of products may cause delays in shipments and supply constraints.  Our inability to timely manufacture any of our significant products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   
 Our manufacturing processes and those of our third party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.  It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer.  If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third party contract manufacturers or certain of our third party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third party contract manufacturers or third party service providers comply, or indefinitely.  Because our third party contract manufacturers and certain of our third party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third party contract manufacturers and third party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all.  If we or our third party contract manufacturers or third party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third party contract manufacturers and third party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock outs and/or recalls of our products.   
 Investigations of the calculation of average wholesale prices may adversely affect our business.   
   Many government and third party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, Health Maintenance Organization and Managed Care Organization, have historically reimbursed doctors, pharmacies and others for the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drug s average wholesale price ( AWP ) or wholesale acquisition cost ( WAC ).  In the past several years, state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers  reporting practices with respect to AWP and WAC, in which they have suggested that reporting of inflated AWP s or WAC s has led to excessive payments for prescription drugs.  For example, beginning in July 2002, we and certain of our subsidiaries, as well as numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in various state and federal court actions alleging improper or fraudulent practices related to the reporting of AWP and/or WAC of certain products, and other improper acts, in order to increase prices and market shares. Similarly, in December  
 29 

2015, Forest and other company subsidiaries were named as defendants in a private class action litigation in Pennsylvania based on similar allegations.  Additional actions are possible.  These actions, if successful, could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.    
 We are subject to US federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and the failure to comply with such laws may adversely affect our business.   
 In the United States, many of our products are reimbursed under federal and state health care programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, and/or state pharmaceutical assistance programs, and as a result, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients  rights are and will be applicable to our business.  We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.  The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:  (i) the US Anti Kickback Statute, which applies to our marketing and research practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (ii) federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent; (iii) the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, ( HIPAA ), which among other things created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and places restrictions on the use of such information for marketing communications; (iv) the US Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which among other things, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under a federal healthcare program to report annually information related to  payments or other transfers of value  made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by certain healthcare professionals and their immediate family members and similar state laws; (v) the government pricing rules applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program, the US Department of Veterans Affairs program, the TRICARE program, and state price reporting laws; and (vi) state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above US laws, such as anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payer, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.  Violations of the fraud and abuse laws may result in severe penalties against Allergan and/or its responsible employees, including jail sentences, large fines, and the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federal and state programs.  Defense of litigation claims and government investigations can be costly, time consuming, and distract management, and it is possible that Allergan could incur judgments or enter into settlements that would require us to change the way we operate our business.  We are committed to conducting the sales and marketing of our products in compliance with the healthcare fraud and abuse laws, but certain applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud.  Furthermore, should there be ambiguity, a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position we have taken, or should an employee violate these laws without our knowledge, a governmental authority may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions.   
 Any adverse outcome in these types of actions, or the imposition of penalties or sanctions for failing to comply with the fraud and abuse laws, could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Some of the statutes and regulations that govern our activities, such as federal and state anti kickback and false claims laws, are broad in scope, and while exemptions and safe harbors protecting certain common activities exist, they are often narrowly drawn.  While we manage our business activities to comply with these statutory provisions, due to their breadth, complexity and, in certain cases, uncertainty of application, it is possible that our activities could be subject to challenge by various government agencies.  In particular, the FDA, the US Department of Justice and other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the sales, marketing, research and similar activities of pharmaceutical companies in recent years, and many pharmaceutical companies have been subject to government investigations related to these practices.  A determination that we are in violation of these and/or other government regulations and legal requirements may result in civil damages and penalties, criminal fines and prosecution, administrative remedies, the recall of products, the total or partial suspension of manufacture and/or distribution, seizure of products, injunctions, whistleblower lawsuits, failure to obtain approval of pending product applications, withdrawal of existing product approvals, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and other sanctions.   
   Allergan is also currently responding to subpoenas seeking information relating to its sales and marketing activities, including payments to people who are in a position to recommend drugs and off label promotion and the Company is defending litigations based on similar allegations.  Refer to  Legal Matters  in  NOTE  24   Commitments and Contingencies  in the accompanying  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for more information.  We cannot predict or determine the impact of these inquiries on our future  
 30 

financial condition or results of operations.  These investigations and any other threatened or actual government enforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could be used productively on other aspects of our business.   
 Any of these types of investigations or enforcement actions could affect our ability to commercially distribute our products and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    
 Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.   
 All pharmaceutical companies, including Allergan, are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation.  For the US, this is principally administered by the FDA, but is also administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency  DEA  and state government agencies, as well as by varying regulatory agencies in foreign countries where products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations, and similar foreign statutes and regulations, govern or influence the development, testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution and import/ export of our products.  Foreign regulatory authorities impose similar requirements focused on drug safety and effectiveness.  Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time consuming and costly.  In addition, changes in applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations or the implementation of new laws and regulations could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.  There is currently the potential for regulatory changes adverse to our business due to recent uncertainty related to the direction of US regulatory policy related to the pharmaceutical industry. 
 Once regulatory approval has been obtained, agencies continue to have substantial authority to require additional testing, perform inspections, change product labeling based on post-marketing safety information or mandate withdrawals of our products.  Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions.  These sanctions may include, among others, untitled letters, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, debarment, product seizure or detention, product recalls and total or partial suspension of production, sale and promotion.  In addition, we may voluntarily elect to recall or restrict the use of a product.  Any recall or restriction could divert managerial and financial resources and might harm our reputation.   
 Under these statutes and regulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our products by the FDA and similar ex US authorities, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable requirements.  In addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies conduct pre approval and post approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other regulations.  Following such inspections, the FDA or other agency may issue observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection.  FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of  regulatory significance  for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action.  We are also required to report adverse events associated with our products to the FDA and other regulatory authorities.  Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in product liability claims, labeling changes, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions, including withdrawal of product approvals.  Adverse events and safety concerns can arise as our product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice.  We are required to communicate to regulatory agencies adverse events reported to us regarding our products.   
 We cannot assure that the FDA inspections at any of our manufacturing sites will not result in inspectional observations at such sites, that approval of any of the pending or subsequently submitted NDAs or supplements to such applications by Allergan plc or our subsidiaries will be granted or that the FDA will not seek to impose additional sanctions against Allergan plc or any of its subsidiaries.  The range of possible sanctions includes, among others, FDA issuance of adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA s review of product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions, and civil or criminal prosecution.  Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.  Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals.  Similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the FDA under a consent decree, depending upon the actual terms of such decree.  Although we have instituted internal compliance programs, if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could materially harm our business.  Certain of our vendors are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections and may be operating under consent decrees.   
   In order to market our products in the United States and other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements required for approval as well as maintaining registrations post-approval.  The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming,  
 31 

uncertain and costly, and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments.  We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third   party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping our products.  There is always the chance that we will not obtain FDA or other necessary approvals, or that the rate, timing and cost of obtaining such approvals, will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations.  Additionally, any regulatory approvals we receive may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or may contain requirements for potentially costly additional clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product.  We may only market or promote our products for their approved indications, and our labeling, promotional activities and advertising are subject to extensive regulation and oversight.  We carry inventories of certain product(s) in anticipation of launch, and if such product(s) are not subsequently launched, we may be required to write   off the related inventory.    
 Our customers are subject to various regulatory requirements, including requirements of the DEA, FDA, state boards of pharmacy and city and county health regulators, among others.  These include licensing, registration, recordkeeping, security and reporting requirements. Additionally, although physicians may prescribe FDA approved products for an  off label  indication, we are permitted to market our products only for the indications for which they have been approved.  Some of our products are prescribed off label and the FDA, the US Department of Justice, the US Attorney or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement actions if they conclude that we or our distributors have engaged in off label marketing.  In addition, historically a number of states and the federal government have enforced licensing and anti-counterfeit drug pedigree laws which require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription drugs beginning with the manufacturer, through the supply chain, and down to the pharmacy or other health care provider dispensing or administering prescription drug products.  Therefore, manufacturers and wholesale distributors have been required to maintain records documenting the chain of custody on distribution of prescription drugs.  On November 27, 2013, the federal government enacted the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) amending federal requirements in regard to the licensing and tracking of prescription drugs.  Certain provisions in the new law related to licensing and track and trace specifically preempted prior state laws related to drug pedigrees that are inconsistent, more stringent, or in addition to the federal law.  Specifically, Title II of the DQSA, also known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), provides for creation of an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.   These amendments include new requirements on licensing, tracking and tracing and other operations applicable to manufacturers and wholesale distributors of prescription drug products.  The full requirements of the DSCSA will be phased in over a ten year period; however, in January 2015, specific product tracing requirements for manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs became effective.  Also, as of January 2015, the DSCSA required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to implement systems to identify potential  suspect  or  illegitimate  product, and take appropriate action.  The DSCSA also addresses product tracing using unique product identifiers on packaging, and requirements for standardized numerical identifiers which will take effect in the future.  
 In addition to government agencies that promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us, other professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities.  For example, the treatment practices of physicians that currently prescribe our products may change.  Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies, as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers.  Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results.   
 The supply of APIs into Europe may be negatively affected by recent regulations promulgated by the European Union.   
 As of July 2, 2013, all APIs imported into the EU must be certified as complying with the good manufacturing practice standards established by the EU, as stipulated by the International Conference for Harmonization.  These new regulations place the certification requirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries.  Accordingly, the national regulatory authorities of each exporting country must:  (i) ensure that all manufacturing plants within their borders that export API into the EU comply with EU manufacturing standards and; (ii) for each API exported, present a written document confirming that the exporting plant conforms to EU manufacturing standards.  The imposition of this responsibility on the governments of the nations exporting API may cause a shortage of API necessary to manufacture our products, as certain governments may not be willing or able to comply with the regulation in a timely fashion, or at all.  A shortage in API may cause us to have to cease manufacture of certain products, or to incur costs and delays to qualify other suppliers to substitute for those API manufacturers unable to export.  This could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.   
 Federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products could adversely affect our business.   
   As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003, companies are required to file with the FTC and the Department of Justice certain types of agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs.  This requirement, as well as legislation pending in the US  
 32 

Congress related to settlements between brand and generic drug manufacturers, could affect the manner in which brand drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with generic pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase or lengthening of litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the FTC or other governmental authorities.  The impact of this requirement, the pending legislation and the potential private   party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand and generic drug manufacturers, is uncertain and could adversely affect our business.  For example, on April 5, 2013, class actions were filed against Warner Chilcott plc and certain affiliates alleging that its 2009 patent lawsuit settlements with Watson Laboratories, Inc. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. related to Loestrin        24 Fe (norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets,  Loestrin        24 ) are unlawful.  The complaints generally allege that Watson and Lupin improperly delayed launching generic versions of Loestrin        24 in exchange for substantial payments from Warner Chilcott in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws.  Similar lawsuits have been filed against the Company challenging the lawfulness of patent litigation settlements related to Asacol        and Namenda       .  We have also received requests for information and Statements of Objection in connection with investigations into settlements and other arrangements between competing pharmaceutical companies by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Competition Commission.  For example, in May 2014, Forest received a Civil Investigatory Demand from the FTC requesting information about Forest s agreements with ANDA filers for Bystolic       .  Any adverse outcome of these actions or investigations, or actions or investigations related to other settlements we have entered into, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Refer to   Legal Matters   in  NOTE 24   Commitments and Contingencies  in the accompanying  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     
 Healthcare reform and a reduction in the coverage and reimbursement levels by governmental authorities, HMOs, MCOs or other third party payers may adversely affect our business.   
 Demand for our products depends in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement is available from third party payers, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors.  In order to commercialize our products, we have obtained from government authorities and private health insurers and other organizations, such as Health Maintenance Organizations and Managed Care Organizations, recognition for coverage and reimbursement at varying levels for the cost of certain of our products and related treatments.  Third party payers increasingly challenge pricing of pharmaceutical products.  Further, the trend toward managed healthcare in the US, the growth of organizations such as HMOs and MCOs and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs create uncertainties regarding the future levels of coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products.  Such cost containment measures and healthcare reform could reduce reimbursement of our pharmaceutical products, resulting in lower prices and a reduction in the product demand.  This could affect our ability to sell our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   
 There have been changes in reimbursement for pharmaceuticals under various government programs, including Medicaid, and there is uncertainty surrounding implementation of legislation and regulatory changes relating to reimbursement for pharmaceuticals under Medicaid and other government programs such as Medicare and Tricare.   Reimbursement changes under such government programs may impact demand for our products and may negatively affect the price.   In addition, any reimbursement granted may not be maintained or limits on reimbursement available from third party payers may reduce demand for, or negatively affect the price of, those products.  Additionally, various legislative and regulatory initiatives in states, including proposed modifications to reimbursements and rebates, product pedigree and tracking, pharmaceutical waste  take back  initiatives, and therapeutic category generic substitution carve out legislation may also have a negative impact on the Company.  We maintain a full time government affairs department in Washington, D.C., which is responsible for coordinating state and federal legislative activities, and places a major emphasis in terms of management time and resources to ensure a fair and balanced legislative and regulatory arena.   
 Although the ACA reforms have significantly impacted our business, in the coming years, it is likely that additional changes, including the potential repeal of all or certain aspects of these reforms, will be made to governmental healthcare and insurance reimbursement programs. On January 20, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order, which stated that it is the policy of his Administration to seek the prompt repeal of the ACA and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. Additionally, the House and Senate recently passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the ACA and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate.  The Trump Administration has also issued numerous executive orders in its early days, including a  regulatory freeze  order issued on January 20, 2017 that temporarily postpones by 60 days the effective date of regulations that have not yet taken effect (subject to certain limitations) and a  one in, two out  executive order issued on January 30, 2017 that requires two rules be  identified for elimination  for every new one proposed. There is uncertainty with respect to the timing of any potential changes, to coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA.  We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any such reform on our business.  Additionally, the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products have recently received the attention of US policymakers, the Trump Administration, and others. At this time, we cannot predict the impact of this increased scrutiny on the pricing or reimbursement of our products or pharmaceutical products generally. 
 33 

Sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base.    
 Our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains.  These customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the US  This distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains.  As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors and large chain drug stores control a significant share of the market.  We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers, including the Company.   
 The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In addition, none of our customers are party to any long term supply agreements with us, and thus are able to change suppliers freely should they wish to do so.   
 Developments after a product reaches the market may adversely affect sales of our products.     
 Even after regulatory approval, certain developments may decrease demand for our products, including the following:   

the re review of products that are already marketed;      

new scientific information and evolution of scientific theories;      

the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed;      

changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy or labeling changes; and      

greater scrutiny in advertising and promotion.       

 In the past, clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of the Company and of competitors within the industry have raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products.  If previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of our products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require us to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes.   
 In addition, certain health authorities, regulators and agencies have increased their focus on safety when assessing the balance of benefits and risks of drugs.  Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products and are re reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes.  There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the U.S., on advertising, and promotion (in particular, direct to consumer advertising) and pricing of pharmaceutical products.  Certain regulatory changes or decisions could make it more difficult for us to sell our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 If we do not successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into our business operations, our business could be adversely affected.  
 We will need to successfully integrate the operations of recently and pending acquired businesses, including Tobira, Vitae, and ForSight, with our business operations.   As a result of these and other recent and any other future or pending acquisitions, we have undergone substantial changes in a short period of time and our business has changed and broadened in size and the scope of products we offer.  Integrating the operations of multiple new businesses with that of our own is a complex, costly and time consuming process, which requires significant management attention and resources to integrate the business practice and operations.  The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us.  Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.  Prior to each acquisition, the acquired business operated independently, with its own business, corporate culture, locations, employees and systems.  There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in any integration of other businesses with that of our own.  These may include:   

distracting management from day to day operations;      

potential incompatibility of corporate cultures;      

an inability to achieve synergies as planned;      

 34 

risks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets;      

adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers;      

inheriting and uncovering previously unknown issues, problems and costs from the acquired company;      

delays between our expenditures to acquire new products, technologies or businesses and the generation of revenues from those acquired products, technologies or businesses;      

realization of assets and settlement of liabilities at amounts equal to estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of any acquisition or disposition;      

revenue recognition related to licensing agreements and/or strategic collaborations;      

costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures (including technology, compliance programs, financial systems, distribution and general business operations, among others); and      

increased difficulties in managing our business due to the addition of international locations.      

 These risks may be heightened in cases where the majority of the former businesses  operations, employees and customers are located outside of the United States.  Any one or all of these factors may increase operating costs or lower anticipated financial performance.  Many of these factors are also outside of our control.  In addition, dispositions of certain key products, technologies and other rights may affect our business operations.  
 In addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisitions, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect.  These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frames, or at all.  Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses.  All of these factors could cause a reduction to our earnings, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transactions, and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares.  
 The failure to integrate the business operations of the acquired businesses successfully would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
 Any acquisitions of businesses, technologies, or products or other significant transactions could adversely affect our relationships with employees, vendors or key customers.   
 We regularly review potential acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses complementary to our business.  Acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating operations, personnel, technologies and products.  Refer to   If we do not successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into our business operations our business could be adversely affected.      In connection with acquisitions, we could experience disruption in our business, technology and information systems, financial systems, vendors customer or employee base, including diversion of management s attention from our continuing operations, among others.  Refer to   Certain aspects of our operations are highly dependent on third party service providers.      There is also a risk that key employees of companies that we acquire or key employees necessary to successfully commercialize technologies and products that we acquire may seek employment elsewhere, including with our competitors.  Furthermore, there may be overlap between our products or customers and the companies that we acquire that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses.   
 If we are unsuccessful in our joint ventures and other collaborations, our operating results could suffer.   
 We have made substantial investments in joint ventures and other collaborations, and may use these and other methods to develop or commercialize products in the future.  These arrangements typically involve other pharmaceutical companies as partners that may be competitors of ours in certain markets.  In many instances, we will not control these joint ventures or collaborations or the commercial exploitation of the licensed products, and cannot assure you that these ventures will be profitable.  Joint venture agreements may place limitations or restrictions on marketing our products.  Any such marketing restrictions could affect future revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our results of operations may suffer if existing joint venture or collaboration partners withdraw, or if these products are not timely developed, approved or successfully commercialized and we cannot guarantee the successful outcome of such efforts, nor that they will result in any intellectual property rights or products that inure to our benefit.   
 35 

We have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction, integration and restructuring costs in connection with recent transactions, including our acquisitions of Legacy Allergan, LifeCell, and the sale of our generics business and certain other assets to Teva.  
 We have incurred significant transaction costs related to our acquisitions such as Legacy Allergan, LifeCell, and the sale of our generics business and certain other assets to Teva and will continue to incur significant transaction costs related to past acquisitions.  In addition, we will incur integration costs and restructuring costs as we integrate the businesses.  While Allergan has assumed that a certain level of transaction and coordination expenses will be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond Allergan s control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these transaction and coordination expenses.  Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately.  Although we expect that the realization of benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset these transaction costs, integration costs and restructuring costs over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all.  The failure to realize the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   
 In addition, as a result of acquiring businesses, technologies or products, or entering into other significant transactions, we may experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses.  These costs may include substantial fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, advisors, consultants and severance and other closure costs associated with regulator mandated divestitures and the elimination of duplicate or discontinued products, operations and facilities.  Charges that we may incur in connection with acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods.   
 We could be liable for sales price adjustments relating to the Teva Transaction. 
 As described in  NOTE 7   Discontinued Operations , the purchase price payable to us by Teva in connection with our divestiture of the global generic pharmaceutical business and other assets is subject to adjustment based on working capital amounts, the amounts of which have not yet been agreed upon. Teva may make claims against us relating to the provision for adjustment of the sales prices, and the amounts relating to those claims could be substantial. 
 Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.  
 Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons.  As a result, we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.  Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section.  These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.  
 Our debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations.  Any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.   
 Our indebtedness and other financial obligations could:   

impair our ability to obtain financing or additional debt in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;      

impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us;      

have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and affirmative and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of a failure that is not cured or waived;      

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow for interest payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures;      

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and      

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionally less debt.       

 Additionally, certain of our financing agreements may contain cross default or other similar provisions whereby a default under one financing agreement could result in a default under our other financing agreements.   
   If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and other financial obligations such as planned dividends, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other financial transactions, seek additional equity capital or sell our assets.  We might then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell our assets on satisfactory terms, if at all.  Any refinancing of our  
 36 

indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, and/or incur significant transaction fees.  Refer to  NOTE 16   Long-Term Debt and Leases  for a detailed discussion of our outstanding indebtedness.    
 Significant balances of intangible assets, including product rights and goodwill acquired, are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   
 A significant amount of our total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill.  As of December 31, 2016, the carrying value of our product rights and other intangible assets was $62,618.6 million and the carrying value of our goodwill was $46,356.1 million. 
 Our product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization.  We determine original fair value and amortization periods for product rights based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products.  Such factors include the product s position in its life cycle, the existence or absence of like products in the market, various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms.  Significant adverse changes to any of these factors would require us to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset.  For assets that are not impaired, the Company may adjust the remaining useful lives.  Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   
 Our other significant intangible assets include acquired core technology and customer relationships, which are intangible assets with definite lives, and our acquired IPR D intangible products, acquired in recent business acquisitions, which are intangible assets with indefinite lives.   
 Our acquired core technology and customer relationship intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization.  We determined the original fair value of our other intangible assets by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which is based on our assessment of various factors.  Such factors include existing operating margins, the number of existing and potential competitors, product pricing patterns, product market share analysis, product approval and launch dates, the effects of competition, customer attrition rates, consolidation within the industry and generic product lifecycle estimates.  Our other intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment when there are significant changes to any of these factors.  If evidence of impairment exists, we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the impaired asset.  Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   
 Goodwill and our IPR D intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events occur or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset.  Impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount.  A goodwill or IPR D impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  
 We may need to raise additional funds in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.   
 We may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes.  If we issue equity, convertible preferred equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing shareholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders.  If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses and potentially lowering our credit ratings.  We may not be able to market such issuances on favorable terms, or at all, in which case, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.   
 The loss of our key personnel could cause our business to suffer.   
 The success of our present and future operations will depend, to a significant extent, upon the experience, abilities and continued services of key personnel.  For example, although we have other senior management personnel, a significant loss of the services of Brent Saunders, our Chief Executive Officer, or other senior executive officers without having or hiring a suitable successor, could cause our business to suffer.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel.  We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our senior executive officers but such agreements do not guarantee that our senior executive officers will remain employed by us for a significant period of time, or at all.  We do not carry key employee life insurance on any of our officers.   
 37 

Substantial amounts of our information concerning our products, customers, employees and ongoing business are stored digitally and are subject to threats of theft, tampering, or other intrusion.    
 We collect and maintain information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data.  This digital information includes, but is not limited to, confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees.  Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering, and theft.  Cyber attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity.  Cyber attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial of service attacks, worms, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability.  We have established physical, electronic, and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of digital information.  However, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more sophisticated.  Despite our efforts, the possibility of a future data compromise cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with intrusion, tampering, and theft remain.  Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that data, including intellectual property or personal information, may be exposed to unauthorized individuals or to the public.  In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue our business objectives.  While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised.  If our data systems are compromised, our business operations may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished, and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property.  If personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business and/or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or be required to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of such incidents.   
 Our business will continue to expose us to risks of environmental liabilities.   
 Our product and API development programs, manufacturing processes and distribution logistics involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and toxic compounds in our owned and leased facilities.  As a result, we are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water.  Our programs and processes expose us to risks that an accidental contamination could result in (i) our noncompliance with such environmental laws and regulations and (ii) regulatory enforcement actions or claims for personal injury and property damage against us.  If an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines.  The substantial unexpected costs we may incur could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  In addition, environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities.  Any modification, revocation or non renewal of our environmental permits could have a material adverse effect on our ongoing operations, business and financial condition.  Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased development or manufacturing activities at any of our facilities.   
 Our foreign operations may become less attractive if political and diplomatic relations between the United States and any country where we conduct business operations deteriorates.   
 The relationship between the United States and the foreign countries where we conduct business operations may weaken over time.  Changes in the state of the relations between any such country and the United States are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our future operations.  This could lead to a decline in our profitability.  Any meaningful deterioration of the political, economic and diplomatic relations between the United States and the relevant country could have a material adverse effect on our operations.   
 Our global operations, particularly following our acquisitions including Legacy Allergan, expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.   
   We operate on a global basis with offices or activities in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, Australia and North America.  We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations.  These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements; labor relations laws; tax laws; competition regulations; import and trade restrictions; economic sanctions; export requirements; US laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; the UK Bribery Act 2010; and other local laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers.  Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some  
 38 

provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges.  Further, certain of our employees, including employees located in certain jurisdictions in Canada, Europe and Asia, are represented by collective bargaining or other labor agreements or arrangements that provide bargaining or other rights to employees.  Such employment rights require us to expend greater time and expense in making changes to employees  terms of employment or carrying out staff reductions.  In addition, any national or other labor disputes in these regions could result in a work stoppage or strike by our employees that could delay or interrupt our ability to supply products and conduct operations.  Due to the nature of these collective bargaining agreements, we will have no control over such work stoppages or strikes by such employees, and a strike may occur even if the employees do not have any grievances against us.  Any interruption in manufacturing or operations could interfere with our business and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.    
 In addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:   

longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;      

political and economic instability or sanctions in areas in which we operate;      

potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers;      

regulations related to customs and import/export matters (including sanctions);      

tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws;      

challenges in collecting accounts receivable from customers in the jurisdictions in which we operate;      

complying with laws, rules and regulations relating to the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products in the jurisdictions in which we do or will operate;      

operating under regulations in jurisdictions related to obtaining eligibility for government or private payor reimbursement for our products at the wholesale/retail level;      

competition from local, regional and international competitors;      

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, including cultural and language differences and additional employment regulations, union workforce negotiations and potential disputes in the jurisdictions in which we operate;      

difficulties associated with compliance with a variety of laws and regulations governing international trade, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;      

difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights; and      

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.       

 These factors or any combination of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   
 Our ordinary share dividend policy is subject to change and could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares. 
 Our ordinary share dividend policy is based upon our Board of Directors  current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate.  That assessment could change based on competitive or commercial developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures), new growth opportunities, the terms of future debt instruments, legal risks, changes in Irish corporate or tax or federal tax law and challenges to our business model. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, amend or repeal our dividend policy to decrease the level of dividends on our ordinary shares  or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends on our ordinary shares.  The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares.  
 39 

Our share repurchase program may not enhance shareholder value.  
 Repurchases of our ordinary shares under our completed share repurchase program or under our continuing accelerated share repurchase program reduce the number of outstanding shares of our ordinary shares. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our ordinary shares may decline below the levels at which we repurchased ordinary shares. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. 
 We have exposure to tax liabilities.   
 As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non income based taxes in various jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.  We are subject to costs and other potential outcomes from tax audits.  The Company believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.   
   
 Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate.  Proposals for fundamental US international tax reform, including without limitation provisions that would limit the ability of US corporations to deduct interest, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate.  Many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws which could impact our future tax obligations.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Sharing Project, and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules.  If the Company s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 We would be adversely affected if, either based on current law or in the event of a change in law, the Internal Revenue Service did not agree that Allergan plc is a foreign corporation for US federal tax purposes.  In addition, future changes to international tax laws not specifically related to inversions could adversely affect us.   
 Allergan plc believes that, under current law, it is treated as a foreign corporation for US federal tax purposes, because it is an Irish incorporated entity.  However, the IRS may assert that Allergan plc should be treated as a US corporation for US federal tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874.  Under Section 7874, a corporation created or organized outside the United States (i.e., a foreign corporation) will be treated as a US corporation for US federal tax purposes when (i) the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the assets held directly or indirectly by a US corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets of the US corporation by acquiring all the outstanding shares of the US corporation), (ii) the shareholders of the acquired US corporation hold at least 80% (by either vote or value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the US acquired corporation (including the receipt of the foreign corporation s shares in exchange for the US corporation s shares), and (iii) the foreign corporation s  expanded affiliated group  does not have substantial business activities in the foreign corporation s country of organization or incorporation relative to such expanded affiliated group s worldwide activities.  For purposes of Section 7874, multiple acquisitions of US corporations by a foreign corporation, if treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions, may be treated as a single acquisition.  If multiple acquisitions of US corporations are treated as a single acquisition, all shareholders of the acquired US corporations would be aggregated for purposes of the test set forth above concerning such shareholders holding at least 80% (by either vote or value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisitions by reason of holding shares in the acquired US corporations.   
   Allergan believes that the test set forth above to treat Allergan as a foreign corporation was satisfied in connection with the transactions resulting in the combination of Actavis, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and Warner Chilcott plc, a company incorporated under the laws of Ireland (the  Warner Chilcott Transactions ), the subsequent acquisition of Forest Laboratories, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Forest Acquisition ), and the acquisition of Allergan, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Allergan Acquisision ).  However, the law and Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 7874 are somewhat unclear, and thus it cannot be assured that the IRS will agree that the ownership requirements to treat Allergan as a foreign corporation were met in the Warner Chilcott Transactions, the Forest Acquisition and/or the Allergan Acquisition and  the IRS may assert that, even though the Allergan Acquisition is a separate transaction from the Warner Chilcott Transactions and the Forest Acquisition, the Allergan Transaction should be integrated with the Warner Chilcott Transactions  
 40 

and the Forest Acquisition as a single transaction.  In the event the IRS were to prevail with such assertion, Allergan would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes and significant adverse tax consequences would result for Allergan.    
 Even if Allergan is respected as a foreign corporation for US federal tax purposes, Allergan might be adversely impacted by recent proposals that have aimed to make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations.  For example, the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting.  As a result, the tax laws in the United States, Ireland, and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect Allergan and its affiliates (including Legacy Allergan and its affiliates).   
 Moreover, US and foreign tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies that result from cross border business combinations, such as Allergan, which may lead such authorities to assert that Allergan owes additional taxes.  
 Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our business and financial results.   
 We do business and generate sales in numerous countries outside the United States.  The Company has also entered and will from time to time enter into acquisition, licensing, borrowing, hedging or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure.  As such, foreign currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in such international operations.  Some of our operating expenses are incurred in non US dollar currencies.  The appreciation of non US dollar currencies in those countries where we have operations against the US dollar could increase our costs and could harm our results of operations and financial condition.   
 A failure of our internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business or share price.   
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of the Allergan plc Ordinary Shares.   
 In the year ended December 31, 2016, management concluded that there was a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting as it did not maintain effective controls to appropriately assess the tax implications of certain transactions between our subsidiaries. This control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of our current or prior period consolidated financial statements. However, this control deficiency could have resulted in a misstatement to the income tax accounts and disclosures, which would have resulted in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. Management has begun to take steps to remediate the material weakness including adding resources and enhancing existing controls and income tax reporting policies and procedures to ensure the implications of certain transactions between our subsidiaries are fully analyzed. While we have made significant progress, the material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the enhanced controls have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time. 
 We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders.   
 Our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.  As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014 (the  Companies Act ).  The Companies Act and other relevant aspects of Irish law differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to US corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.  For example, under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.  As a result, shareholders of Irish companies do not have the right to bring an action against the directors or officers of a company, except in limited circumstances.  In addition, depending on the circumstances, you may be subject to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law as a result of your acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares, including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax.    
 41 

As a result of different shareholder voting requirements in Ireland relative to laws in effect in certain states in the United States, we may have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management than companies organized in the United States.     
 Under Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.  Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution. Such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares.  Accordingly, our articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, provisions authorizing the board to issue new shares, and to disapply statutory preemption rights.  The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.    
 We are an Irish company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us or certain of our officers and directors.   
 We are incorporated in Ireland and a substantial portion of our assets are located in jurisdictions outside the United States.  In addition, some of our officers and directors reside outside the United States, and some or all of their respective assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside of the United States.  Therefore, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process against us or such officers or directors or to enforce against us or them judgments of US courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the US federal securities laws.   
 There is no treaty between Ireland and the United States providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments.  The following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in Ireland:   

the judgment must be for a definite sum;      

the judgment must be final and conclusive; and      

the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction.       

 An Irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if the judgment violated Irish public policy, if the judgment is in breach of natural justice or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment.  Further, an Irish court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.  Judgments of US courts of liabilities predicated upon US federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish courts if deemed to be contrary to public policy in Ireland.   
 A transfer of Company Ordinary Shares, other than by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ), may be subject to Irish stamp duty, as may a transfer of preference shares.   
 Transfers of Company Ordinary Shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.  However, if you hold your Company Ordinary Shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of your Company Ordinary Shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired).  Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. Transfers of preference shares may also be subject to Irish stamp duty at the same rate.  The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your shares.   
 In certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.   
 In certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of any dividends paid on our ordinary shares or our preference shares.  A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the US and shareholders resident in certain countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax.   
   Shareholders resident in the US that hold their shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the US (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us).  US resident shareholders in Allergan plc that hold their shares outside of DTC and shareholders resident in certain other countries (irrespective of whether they hold their shares through DTC or outside DTC) will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the beneficial owners of such shares have furnished completed and valid dividend withholding tax forms or an IRS Form 6166, as appropriate, to our  
 42 

transfer agent or their brokers (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to our transfer agent).  However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of your shares.   
 Dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.   
 Shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends, unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in us (for example, they are resident in Ireland).  Shareholders who are not resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland but who are not entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends which suffer dividend withholding tax.   
 Company Ordinary Shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax.   
 Irish capital acquisitions tax ( CAT ) could apply to a gift or inheritance of Company Ordinary Shares or our preference shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties.  This is because Company Ordinary Shares and preference shares are regarded as property situated in Ireland.  The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT.  Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT.  Children have a tax-free threshold of  300,000 (with effect from 12 October 2016) in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents.  Certain other tax-free thresholds may also apply.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 Overview 
 Allergan plc is a global specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of brand name pharmaceutical products, medical aesthetics, biosimilar and OTC pharmaceutical products. The Company has operations in more than 100 countries. Warner Chilcott Limited is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc and has the same principal business activities. As a result of the Allergan Acquisition which closed on March 17, 2015, the Company expanded its franchises to include ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery, which complemented the Company s existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women s health and urology franchises. The combined company benefits significantly from Legacy Allergan s global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox    and Restasis   . The Allergan Acquisition expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America. 
 On July 26, 2015 we entered into the Teva Agreement.  Upon the closing of the Teva Transaction on August 2, 2016, we received $33.3 billion in cash, net of cash acquired by Teva,  which included estimated working capital and other contractual adjustments,  and 100.3 million unregistered Teva ordinary shares (or American Depository Shares with respect thereto), which approximated $5.0 billion in value using the closing date Teva opening stock price discounted at a rate of 5.9 percent due to the lack of marketability.   
 As part of the Teva Agreement, Teva acquired our global generics business, including the U.S. and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic R D unit, our international OTC commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and certain established international brands.  
 On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business to Teva  for $500.0 million . Teva acquired our Anda Distribution business, which distributes generic, brand, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from more than 300 manufacturers to retail independent and chain pharmacies, nursing homes, mail order pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and physician offices across the U.S.  
 The Company recognized a combined gain on the sale of the Anda Distribution business and the sale of our global generics business of $15,932.2 million as well as deferred liabilities relating to other elements of our arrangements with Teva of $299.2 million. 
 As a result of the Teva Transaction and the divestiture of the Company s Anda Distribution business, and in accordance with FASB ASU number 2014-08  Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity , the Company is accounting for the assets and liabilities divested as held for sale.  Further, the financial results of the businesses held for sale have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.  The results of our discontinued operations include the results of our generic product development, manufacturing and distribution of off-patent pharmaceutical products, certain established international brands marketed similarly to generic products and out-licensed generic pharmaceutical products primarily in Europe through our Medis third-party business through August 2, 2016, as well as our Anda Distribution business through October 3, 2016.

 2014 Significant Business Developments 
 The following are the material transactions that were completed in the year ended December 31, 2014. 
 Acquisitions 
 Durata Therapeutics, Inc. 
 On November 17, 2014, the Company completed the Durata Acquisition. Durata is an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for patients with infectious diseases and acute illnesses. 
 Contingent Consideration  
 At the time of the Durata Acquisition, additional consideration in the form of three potential CVR payments was conditionally due to the seller in the event of the approval of dalbavancin in Europe, the approval of a single dose indication and the product reaching certain sales milestones. The Company estimated the acquisition accounting fair value of the contingent consideration to be $49.0 million using a probability weighted approach that considered the possible outcomes based on assumptions related to the timing and probability of the product launch date, discount rates matched to the timing of the payment, and probability of success rates and discount adjustments on the related cash flows. On March 2, 2015, the Company announced that the European Commission had granted Allergan s subsidiary Durata Therapeutics International B.V., marketing authorization for Xydalba  (dalbavancin) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. The authorization triggered the first CVR payment of $30.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. In January 2016, the Company received approval from the FDA for an expanded label that includes a single dose of Dalvance   , which triggered a second CVR payment of $30.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  The difference between the probability weighted fair value and the final payments are recorded as a component of cost of sales.  
 Furiex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 On July 2, 2014, the Company completed the Furiex Acquisition.  In the second quarter of 2015, the Company received approval from the FDA of the eluxadoline product, Viberzi   . In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received a schedule IV ( C-IV ) designation from the DEA for Viberzi    and recognized an expense of $29.8 million as a component of R D expense.  This expense represents the difference between the final CVR payment amount of $118.5 million, or $10 for each CVR outstanding, versus the probability-weighted CVR fair value initially established in acquisition accounting adjusted for accretion.   
 Forest Laboratories, Inc. 
 On July 1, 2014, the Company completed the Forest Acquisition. The contribution from the acquisition of Forest for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows ($ in millions):  

(1)    
 
 Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights.    

 54 

As a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company incurred the following transaction and integration costs in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 ($ in millions):  

Silom Medical Company  
 On April 1, 2014, the Company acquired Silom Medical Company ( Silom ), a privately held generic pharmaceutical company focused on developing and marketing therapies in Thailand, for consideration of approximately $103.0 million in cash (the  Silom Acquisition ). The Silom Acquisition expanded the Company s position in the Thai generic pharmaceutical market, with leading positions in the ophthalmic and respiratory therapeutic categories and a strong cardiovascular franchise. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.  The assets and liabilities acquired, as well as the results of operations for the acquired Silom business are part of the assets divested in the Teva Transaction and are included as a component of income from discontinued operations.  In addition the acquired financial position was included in assets and liabilities held for sale.  
 Divestitures 
 Corona Facility  
 During the year ended December 31, 2014, we held for sale certain assets in our Corona, California manufacturing facility. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge as a component of discontinued operations of $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, including a write-off of property, plant and equipment, net, due to the integration of Warner Chilcott of $5.8 million.  The Company completed the sale of these assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 with no material impact to the Company s results of operations.  
 Segments  
 During 2016, Allergan announced a realignment of its businesses to streamline operations. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as four distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International and Anda Distribution. Under the new organizational structure being reported, and as a result of our decision to sell our Anda Distribution business, the Company organized its businesses into the following segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs, and the results of corporate initiatives, are managed outside of the three segments.  Prior period results have been recast to align to the current segment presentation. 
 55 

The operating segments are organized as follows:  

The US Specialized Therapeutics segment includes sales and expenses relating to certain branded products within the US, including Medical Aesthetics, Medical Dermatology, Eye Care, Neurosciences and Urology therapeutic products.     

The US General Medicine segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US that do not fall into the US Specialized Therapeutics business units, including Central Nervous System, Gastrointestinal, Women s Health, Anti-Infectives and Diversified Brands.     

The International segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside the US.     

 The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for our segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (defined below), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. Included in segment revenues are product sales that were sold through the Anda Distribution business once the Anda Distribution business had sold the product to a third party customer. These sales are included in segment results and are reclassified into revenues from discontinued operations through a reduction of Corporate revenues which eliminates the sales made by the Anda Distribution business from results of continuing operations prior to October 3, 2016.  Cost of sales for these products in discontinued operations is equal to our average third party cost of sales for third party branded products distributed by Anda Distribution. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level: 

Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales, selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs.     

General and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including certain expenses located within the United States.     

Total assets including capital expenditures.     

Other select revenues and operating expenses including R D expenses, amortization,  IPR D impairments and asset sales and impairments, net as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments.       

 The Company defines segment net revenues as product sales and other revenue derived from branded products or licensing agreements. In March 2015, as a result of the Allergan Acquisition, we began to promote Restasis   , Lumigan   /Ganfort   , Alphagan   /Combigan   , Botox   , Fillers, other aesthetic products and other eye care products. In July 2014, as a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company also began recognizing revenues on key US brands, including, but not limited to, Bystolic    , Canasa   , Carafate   , Fetzima    , Linzess    , Namenda   IR (which lost exclusivity in July 2015), Namenda XR   , Saphris   , Teflaro    and Viibryd   . 
 Cost of sales within segment contribution includes standard production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements and finished goods inventory reserve charges.  Cost of sales included within segment contribution does not include non-standard production costs, such as non-finished goods inventory obsolescence charges, manufacturing variances and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles. 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.  
 General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.

The following is a reconciliation of net revenues for the operating segments to the Company s net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions):  

No country represents ten percent or more of net revenues outside of the United States. The US Specialized Therapeutics and US General Medicine segments are comprised solely of sales within the United States. 
   
 The following table presents global net revenues for the top products of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions): 

58 

US Specialized Therapeutics Segment  
 The following table presents net contribution for the US Specialized Therapeutics segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions): 

(1)    
 
   Includes revenues earned that were distributed through the Anda Distribution business prior to October 3, 2016 to third party customers.    

(2)    
 
   Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights, as well as indirect cost of sales not attributable to segment results .      

(3)    
 
   Defined as net revenues less segment related cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues.    

 Net Revenues 
   The increase in segment revenues is primarily due to a full year contribution from the Allergan Acquisition versus nine and a half months in the prior year. In addition, the Company acquired the rights to Kybella     , a facial aesthetic product indicated for submental  
 59 

fullness, in 2015, and launched the product in the fourth quarter of that year. The Company has continued to realize strong organic growth from these products acquired from Allergan, including Restasis       , Ozurdex       , Botox       , Fillers and the SkinMedica        line.  
 Cost of Sales 
 The increase in cost of sales is due to a full year contribution from the Allergan Acquisition versus nine and a half months in the prior year. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses  
 The increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to a full year contribution from the Allergan Acquisition versus nine and a half months in the prior year, as well as increases in selling and marketing efforts for Kybella     , Restasis     , Botox      Cosmetics, Fillers, and Botox      Therapeutics. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a full year contribution from the Allergan Acquisition versus nine and a half months in the prior year and an increase due to the Company s new operating management structure wherein more costs are directly supporting the operating segments versus corporate functions. Consequently, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of this change.  In addition, there was also a period over period increase in compensation costs.

 Net Revenues 
 The decrease in the US General Medicine segment revenues is primarily driven by the loss of exclusivity on Namenda    IR, which declined $541.2 million, or 97.3%, versus the prior year period. Namenda XR    contributed revenues of $627.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a decline of $131.7 million, or 17.3%, versus the prior year period due to a decline in average net selling price to maintain strong formulary coverage, coupled with a decline in demand. The launches of Namzaric    and Vraylar    have partially offset the impact of the decline of Namenda    IR and Namenda XR   . 
 Growth within our Gastrointestinal franchise was primarily driven by Linzess    and newly launched Viberzi   .  Linzess    revenues increased $170.8 million, or 37.6%, versus the prior year period primarily due to strong demand growth and price appreciation.  The Asacol    / Delzicol    franchise revenues decreased $192.1 million, or 34.7%, due in part to a reduction in demand as a result of lower promotion and some loss in formulary coverage.  In addition, an authorized generic of Asacol    HD was launched in August. Offsetting this decline, in part, is royalty revenue of $45.5 million relating to our authorized generic version of Asacol    HD, which is included within  Other Revenues . 
 Our Women s Healthcare franchise increased $181.6 million, or 18.2%, versus the prior year period.  Lo Loestrin    increased 16.5% due to strong demand growth and modest net price appreciation. Estrace    Cream increased 16.3% as a result of net price appreciation and demand growth. Minastrin    24 increased 19.6% primarily as a result of net price appreciation.  Patents covering generic versions of our Minastrin    product will enter the market as early as March 2017 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into. 
 The decline in Diversified Brands revenues is primarily due to loss of exclusivity on certain products and to product divestitures.    
 Cost of Sales 
 The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decline in product revenues as well as an unfavorable product mix, including increased sales of products that are royalty bearing.  Segment gross margins declined to 85.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 85.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses  
 A modest decrease in selling and marketing expenses is attributable to the overall decline in revenues offset, in part, by redeployment of promotional efforts to key growth brands, including newly launched products Viberzi    and Vraylar . 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative costs is a result of the Company s new operating management structure wherein more costs are directly supporting the operating segments versus corporate functions. Consequently, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of this change.  In addition, there was also a period over period increase in compensation costs.

$210.0 million relating to a urology product acquired in the Allergan Acquisition due to clinical data not supporting continuation of the R D study.  This impairment was offset, in part, by a reduction of the contingent liability of $186.0 million recorded in R

The reconciliations between the statutory Irish tax rates for Allergan plc and the effective income tax rates were as follows: 

The material drivers of the period-over-period tax rate movements are as follows: 

(1)    
 
 Earnings subject to U.S. federal and state tax had a larger impact on the effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the period ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in expenses in 2016. These expenses included a full year of amortization expense related to intangibles acquired as part of the Allergan Acquisition and incremental costs associated with the acquisition related financing.    

(2)    
 
 Earnings subject to tax rates different than the statutory rate had a larger impact on the effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the period ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily driven by the inclusion of a full year of Allergan post-acquisition operating income earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Irish statutory rate and changes to the earnings mix resulting from restructuring associated with the sale of the global generics business.     

(3)    
 
 In 2016, the Company recorded $6.5 billion of amortization expense. A significant portion of this amount was incurred in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the statutory rate resulting in a $482.3 million favorable impact on the effective tax rate.    

(4)    
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2016, a tax rate change was enacted in France resulting in a $209.0 million tax benefit.    

(5)    
 
 In 2016, the Company recorded a tax expense of $183.8 million predominately related to a change in the valuation allowance on U.S. capital loss carryforwards resulting from restructuring associated with the sale of the global generics business.

The reconciliations between the statutory Irish income tax rates for Allergan plc and the effective income tax rates were as follows: 

The material drivers of the period-over-period tax rate movements are as follows: 

(1)    
 
   Earnings subject to U.S. federal and state tax had a larger impact on the effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2015 compared to the period ended December 31, 2014 due to a significant increase in expenses in 2015. These expenses included amortization expense related to intangibles acquired as part of the Allergan Acquisition and incremental costs associated with the acquisition related financing.    

(2)    
 
   The impact of earnings subject to tax rates different than the statutory rate is primarily driven by the inclusion of Allergan post-acquisition operating income earned outside of the U.S. and Ireland. In addition, 2015 includes a full year of operating income from Forest compared to six months in 2014. The impact of this additional income is partially offset by an increase in amortization expense in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the statutory rate.    

(3)    
 
   In 2015, the Company recorded $5.5 billion of amortization expense. A significant portion of this amount was incurred in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the statutory rate resulting in a $246.2 million favorable impact on the effective tax rate.    

 77

          The impact of acquisitions and non-deductible expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily resulted from one-time non-deductible pre-tax expenses for the 2016 Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $153.7 million, Naurex Transaction related upfront consideration of $571.7 million recognized as a component of R D expense and other acquisition related transaction costs of $62.3 million.

(5)    
 
   Valuation allowances for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the release of a $296.2 million valuation allowance on certain capital loss carryforwards as a result of restructuring related to the global generics sale.    

 Discontinued Operations  
 On July 27, 2015, the Company announced that it entered into the Teva Transaction, which closed on August 2, 2016.  Under the Teva Agreement, Teva acquired Allergan's global generics business, including the U.S. and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic R D unit, our international OTC commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and some established international brands.   Allergan retained its global branded pharmaceutical and medical aesthetics businesses, as well as its biosimilars development programs and certain OTC products. The Company also has continuing involvement with Teva after the close of the transaction.  As a result of the Teva Transaction, the Company holds equity in Teva and purchases product manufactured by Teva for sale in our US General Medicine segment as part of ongoing transitional service and contract manufacturing agreements. On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business to Teva for $500.0 million. Teva acquired our Anda Distribution business, which distributes generic, brand, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from more than 300 manufacturers to retail independent and chain pharmacies, nursing homes, mail order pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and physician offices across the U.S. The Company recognized a combined gain on the sale of the Anda Distribution business and the sale of our global generics business of $15,932.2 million. 
 The Company notes the following reconciliation of the proceeds received in the combined transaction to the gain recognized in income from discontinued operations ($ in millions):  

In October 2016, pursuant to the Teva Agreement, Teva provided its proposed estimated adjustment to the closing date working capital balance to the Company.  The final amount of any agreed contractual adjustment could vary materially from the adjustment calculated by the Company at the time of the closing of the Teva Transaction and any agreed adjustment to the Company s proceeds from the Teva Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and cash flows.  The Company expects the amount of the adjustment will be determined in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Teva Agreement. 
   
 The Teva Shares are recorded within  Marketable securities  on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The closing Teva transaction date opening stock price discounted at a rate of 5.9 percent due to the lack of marketability was used to initially value the shares.   During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a $1,599.4 million unrealized loss on the Teva Shares due to a decline in share price, which was recorded as a component of  Other comprehensive income.

 Financial results of the global generics business and the Anda Distribution business are presented as  Income from discontinued operations  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014; and assets and liabilities of the businesses are presented as  Current assets held for sale ,  Non current assets held for sale ,  Current liabilities held for sale  and  Long term liabilities held for sale  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.

The following table presents key financial results of the global generics business and the Anda Distribution business included in  Income from discontinued operations  for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 ($ in millions):  

The operating income reflects approximately seven months of operating activity of the Company s former generics business in the year ended December 31, 2016 versus twelve months activity in the prior year period and approximately nine months of operating activity of the Anda Distribution business in the year ended December 31, 2016 versus twelve months activity in the prior year period.  Other (expense) income, net  included the gain on sale of the businesses to Teva. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $5,738.8 million related to investments in certain subsidiaries. The recognition of this benefit has been reflected in  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax  with the deferred tax asset reflected in non-current  Deferred tax liabilities  on the December 31, 2015 balance sheet as adjusted for activity in the fourth quarter of 2015.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $462.2 million to adjust its deferred tax asset related to investments in certain subsidiaries. The recognition of this expense has been reflected in  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax.   Upon the closing of the Teva Transaction, the Company recorded the reversal of the corresponding deferred tax asset of $5,276.6 million against the current income taxes payable in continuing operations. 
   
 The results of our former global generics business operations were dependent on the timing of product launches and competition within the generics market, primarily in the United States.  The increase in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is the result of continued cost savings initiatives as well as the cessation of depreciation and amortization for assets being divested to Teva once they met the definition of held for sale on July 27, 2015.  Offsetting these amounts, is an increase in divestiture related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 of $97.2 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 Working Capital Position 
 Working capital at December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows: 

Working capital excluding assets held for sale, net, increased $12,098.5 million primarily due to cash proceeds of $33,804.2 million and Teva securities which had a recorded value of $3,439.2 million as of December 31, 2016, both of which were received in the Teva Transaction.  The proceeds were offset in part by the payment of cash taxes relating to the Teva Transaction of $3,293.7 million, the net repayment of long-term and current indebtedness in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $9,798.9 million, and the repurchase of our ordinary shares in connection with the share repurchase programs of $15,000.0 million.  The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily relates to contractual commitments of $264.9 million and an increase in contingent consideration, including amounts owed as part of the Tobira Acquisition.  
 Cash Flows from Operations  
 Our cash flows from operations are summarized as follows: 

Cash flows from operations represent net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $3,104.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the prior year period, due primarily to $3,293.7 million in cash tax payments made in connection with the Teva Transaction, along with a decline in cash flows as a result of divesting the Company s generics and Anda Distribution businesses, which contributed a full year s cash flows in 2015 versus partial contribution in 2016, offset in part, by a full year of contribution resulting from the Allergan Acquisition. 
   
 Management expects that available cash balances and 2017 cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient resources to fund our operating liquidity needs and expected 2017 capital expenditure funding requirements.

 In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and requires management s best estimates of the underlying data in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available GAAP alternatives would not produce a materially different result. 
 Revenue Recognition  
 General 
 Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss to the product transfers to the customer, which is based on the transaction shipping terms. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds, the seller s price to the buyer to be fixed or determinable and the completion of all performance obligations. The Company warrants products against defects and for specific quality standards, permitting the return of products under certain circumstances. Product sales are recorded net of all sales-related deductions including, but not limited to: chargebacks, trade discounts, sales returns and allowances, commercial and government rebates, customer loyalty programs and fee-for-service arrangements with certain distributors, which we refer to in the aggregate as  SRA  allowances. 
 Royalty and commission revenue is recognized as a component of net revenues in accordance with the terms of their respective contractual agreements when collectability is reasonably assured and when revenue can be reasonably measured. 
 Provisions for SRAs 
 As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes gross revenue from the sale of products, an estimate of SRA is recorded, which reduces the product revenues. Accounts receivable and/or accrued liabilities are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount depending on whether we have the right of offset with the customer. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship of the deductions to gross product revenues, government regulations, estimated utilization or redemption rates, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms. The estimation process used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on a consistent basis and no material revenue adjustments have been necessary to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company uses a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of the SRA reserves to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated. 
   Chargebacks    A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesaler s customer pays for that product. The chargeback provision and related reserve varies with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at certain contract prices. The Company validates the chargeback accrual quarterly   
 88 

through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent the vast majority of the recipients of the Company s chargeback payments. We continually monitor current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.  
 Rebates    Rebates include volume related incentives to direct and indirect customers, third-party managed care and Medicare Part D rebates, Medicaid rebates and other government rebates. Rebates are accrued based on an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into trade by the Company. Volume rebates are generally offered to customers as an incentive to use the Company s products and to encourage greater product sales. These rebate programs include contracted rebates based on customers  purchases made during an applicable monthly, quarterly or annual period. The provision for third-party rebates is estimated based on our customers  contracted rebate programs and the Company s historical experience of rebates paid. Any significant changes to our customer rebate programs are considered in establishing the provision for rebates. The provisions for government rebates are based, in part, upon historical experience of claims submitted by the various states / authorities, contractual terms and government regulations. We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on our provision.  
 Cash Discounts    Cash discounts are provided to customers that pay within a specific period. The provision for cash discounts is estimated based upon invoice billings and historical customer payment experience. The Company s experience of payment history is fairly consistent and most customer payments qualify for the cash discount.  
 Returns and Other Allowances    The Company s provision for returns and other allowances include returns, promotional allowances, and loyalty cards.  
 Consistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers to return product for a credit. In accordance with the Company s policy, credits for customer returns of products are applied against outstanding account activity or are settled in cash. Product exchanges are not permitted. Customer returns of product are generally not resalable. The Company s estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience and current trends of actual customer returns. Additionally, we consider other factors when estimating the current period returns provision, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, as well as significant market changes which may impact future expected returns. 
 Promotional allowances are credits that are issued in connection with a product launch or as an incentive for customers to carry our product. The Company establishes a reserve for promotional allowances based upon contractual terms. 
 Loyalty cards allow the end user patients a discount per prescription and are accrued based on historical experience, contract terms and the volume of product and cards in the distribution channel.

The Company s divested generics business also had the following type of SRA s:   

Pricing adjustments, included shelf stock adjustments which are credits issued to reflect price decreases in selling prices charged to the Company s direct customers. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product our customers have in their inventory at the time of an agreed-upon price reduction. The provision for shelf stock adjustments was based upon specific terms with the Company s customers and includes estimates of existing customer inventory levels based upon their historical purchasing patterns.      

Billback adjustments are credits that are issued to certain customers who purchase directly from us as well as indirectly through a wholesaler. These credits are issued in the event there was a difference between the customer s direct and indirect contract price. The provision for billbacks was estimated based upon historical purchasing patterns of qualified customers who purchase product directly from us and supplement their purchases indirectly through our wholesale customers.       

 Inventory Valuation 
 Inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution, raw materials and work in process. Inventory includes brand pharmaceutical products which represents FDA approved or likely to be approved indications. Inventory valuation reserves are established based on a number of factors/situations including, but not limited to, raw materials, work in process or finished goods not meeting product specifications, product obsolescence, or application of the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value) concepts. The determination of events requiring the establishment of inventory valuation reserves, together with the calculation of the amount of such reserves may require judgment. Assumptions utilized in our quantification of inventory reserves include, but are not limited to, estimates of future product demand, consideration of current and future market conditions, product net selling price, anticipated product launch dates, potential product obsolescence and other events relating to special circumstances surrounding certain products. No material adjustments have been required to our inventory reserve estimates for the periods presented. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to our inventory valuation reserves and higher cost of sales. 
 Product Rights and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 Our product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization, and are amortized using the economic benefit model or the straight-line method, if results are materially aligned, over their estimated useful lives. We determine amortization periods for product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows. Such factors include the product s position in its life cycle, the existence or absence of like products in the market, various other competitive and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangibles useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our net results to decline. 
 Product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not recoverable and an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The computed impairment loss is recognized in net (loss) / income in the period that the impairment occurs. Assets which are not impaired may require an adjustment to the remaining useful lives for which to amortize the asset. Our projections of discounted cash flows use a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model. Our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other definite-lived intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors. Different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of the other definite-lived intangible assets which could trigger impairment. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives 
 General 
 The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually in the second quarter by comparing the fair value of each of the Company s reporting units to the respective carrying value of the reporting units. Additionally, the Company may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when the Company has a change to reporting units. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units. 
 91 

Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and this could result in a material impact to net (loss) / income and (loss) / earnings per share.  
 Acquired IPR D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the date acquired, represent the right to develop, use, sell and/or offer for sale a product or other intellectual property that the Company has acquired with respect to products and/or processes that have not been completed or approved. The IPR D intangible assets are subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of each project. Upon abandonment, the assets are impaired. Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows for each year for each project or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R D costs, selling and marketing costs and other costs which may be allocated), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset s life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, and competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the IPR D projects include legal risk, market risk and regulatory risk. Changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment charges. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. 
 Upon successful completion of each project and approval of the product, we will make a separate determination of the useful life of the intangible, transfer the amount to currently marketed products ( CMP ) and amortization expense will be recorded over the estimated useful life. 
 Annual Testing  
 In connection with the realignment of the Company s operating segments in the second quarter of 2016, goodwill was reallocated to reporting units under the new segment structure.  The Company evaluated goodwill for six reporting units during the second quarter of 2016.  The Company performed its annual impairment test utilizing long-term growth rates for its reporting units ranging from 0% to 2.5% in its estimation of fair value and discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.5%.  The factors used in evaluating goodwill for impairment are subject to change and are tracked against historical results by management. Changes in the key assumptions by management can change the results of testing. The Company determined there was no impairment associated with goodwill. 
 During 2016, the Company tested its indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets for impairment noting no impairment. 
   
 The Company regularly reviews IPR D assets for impairment indicators.  In the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded the following significant impairments: 

$210.0 million relating to a urology product acquired in the Allergan Acquisition due to clinical data not supporting continuation of the R D study.  This impairment was offset, in part, by a reduction contingent liability of $186.0 million recorded in R      

$106.0 million relating to a migraine treatment acquired in the Allergan Acquisition based on a decrease in projected cash flows due to a delay in potential launch;     

$46.0 million relating to the Atopic Dermatitis pipeline candidate acquired in the Vitae Acquisition;      

$33.0 million of the acquired ForSight IPR D asset as the Company anticipates a delay in potential launch timing.  Offsetting this impairment was a corresponding reduction of acquired contingent consideration of $15.0 million, which reduced overall R D expenses;     

$35.0 million for an international eye care pipeline project based on a decrease in projected cash flows due to market conditions;     

$40.0 million for a Botox    premature ejaculation product based on a decrease in projected cash flows;     

$24.0 million relating to women s healthcare IPR D projects based on clinical trial results;     

$190.0 million relating to osteoarthritis project based on clinical trial results; and     

$42.0 million on a gastroenterology project based on the lack of future availability of active pharmaceutical ingredients.     

   During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a $197.6 million impairment related to IPR D for select projects as the Company revised its sales forecast of certain assets as well as the timing of the launch of certain projects in connection  
 92 

with the Company s annual review.  In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made the decision to abandon a select IPR D asset (acquired in connection with the Allergan Acquisition) based on  review of research studies, resulting in an impairment of the full asset value of $300.0 million.    In-process research and development impairments for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily included an impairment charge of $165.5 million related to the abandonment of certain R D projects, an impairment charge of $193.0 million related to acquired IPR D due to the FDA communications relating to Allergan s NDA for the fixed-dose combination of nebivolol and valsartan for the treatment of hypertension and the abandonment of a select dermatology project of $32.0 million.  
 Allocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed 
 We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values as determined using a market participant concept. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
 The most material line items impacted by the allocation of acquisition fair values are: 

Intangible assets (including IPR D assets upon successful completion of the project and approval of the product) which are amortized to amortization expense over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates used to present value expected future net cash flow streams, the timing of approvals for IPR D projects and the timing of related product launch dates, the assessment of each asset s life cycle, the impact of competitive trends on each asset s life cycle and other factors. These judgments can materially impact the estimates used to allocate acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the future useful lives. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.     

Fixed asset valuations which are depreciated over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates and intended uses of the assets.     

Inventory which is recorded at fair market value factoring in selling price and costs to dispose. Inventory acquired is typically valued higher than replacement cost.     

 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the Company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company s effective tax rate on future earnings. 
 Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense. 
   
 Defined Benefit Plans  
   The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheets. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. The estimates of the obligation and related expense of these plans recorded in the financial statements are based on certain assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to discount rate  
 93 

and expected return on plan assets. Other assumptions used may include employee demographic factors such as compensation rate increases, retirement patterns, expected employee turnover and participant mortality rates. The difference between these assumptions and actual experience results in the recognition of an asset or liability based upon a net actuarial (gain) / loss. If the total net actuarial (gain) / loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss) exceeds a threshold of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets, it is subject to amortization and recorded as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service lives of the employees participating in the pension plan. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.   
 Contingent Consideration and Other Commitments 
 We determine the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration obligations based on a probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates, post-tax gross profit levels and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations including contingent payments such as milestone obligations, royalty obligations and contract earn-out criteria, where applicable. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined using the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820. The resultant probability-weighted cash flows are discounted using an appropriate effective annual interest rate. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation will be revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value will be reflected as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various contingent payment obligations. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our contingent consideration fair value estimates could result in an increase in our contingent consideration obligation and a corresponding charge to operating results. 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of our business, including product liability litigation, intellectual property litigation, employment litigation and other litigation. We record reserves related to these legal matters when losses related to such litigation or contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable. Refer to  NOTE 24   Commitment and Contingencies  in the accompanying  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  in this document for a description of our significant current legal proceedings. 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), with an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was deferred by one year through the issuance of ASU 2015-14, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued multiple updates which are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance, and to provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients, which include guidance on principal versus agent considerations; identifying performance obligations; licensing implementation guidance; assessing the specific collectability criterion and accounting for certain contracts; presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers; noncash consideration; contract modifications at transition and completed contracts at transition. The guidance provides clarification that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption, however, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the new revenue guidance.  The majority of the Company s revenue relates to the sale of finished product to various customers and we do not believe that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on these transactions.  The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of certain less significant transactions involving collaboration arrangements, warranties, as well as certain rebates and discounts offered.  The Company expects to adopt the standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which changes the requirement to require equity securities (including other ownership interests, such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures, and limited liability companies) to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which states that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations. 
 94 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. This guidance eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when there is an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The Company has assessed the implementation impact on Retained Earnings noting a reduction in retained earnings of $62.4 million on January 1, 2017. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.   The ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets including trade receivables held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates.   The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.    Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations. 
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in GAAP. The amendments require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. Two common examples of assets included in the scope of the amendments are intellectual property and property, plant, and equipment. The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations .  
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, clarifying the definition of a business. The amendments are intended to help companies evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business. This introduces an initial required screening that, if met, eliminates the need for further assessment. To be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. To be a business without outputs, there will need to be an organized workforce. The ASU also narrows the definition of the term  outputs  to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. The changes to the definition of a business may result in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions. 
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle should be disclosed upon transition. The amendments are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the amendments will have on our financial positions and results of operations.

ITEM 7A.   
 
      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     

 The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings. We are exposed to market risk for changes in the market values of our investments (Investment Risk), the impact of interest rate changes (Interest Rate Risk) and the impact of foreign currency exchange changes (Foreign Currency Exchange Risk). 
 We maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including both government and government agency obligations with ratings of A or better and money market funds. Our investments in marketable securities are governed by our investment policy which seeks to preserve the value of our principal, provide liquidity and maximize return on the Company s investment against minimal interest rate risk. Consequently, our interest rate and principal risk are minimal on our non-equity investment portfolio. The quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are set forth below. 
 Investment Risk 
 As of December 31, 2016, our total investments in marketable and equity securities of other companies, including equity method investments were $11,596.5 million (included in marketable securities and investments and other assets). The fair values of these investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions. 
 As of August 2, 2016, the Company owns 100.3 million Teva ordinary shares, which approximated $5.0 billion in value using the closing date Teva opening stock price discounted at a rate of 5.9 percent due to the lack of marketability, and which are subject to changes in value based on the price of Teva shares.  The Company is subject to lock-up restrictions with the investment in Teva, and as such, these shares are also subject to liquidity risk. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a $1,599.4 million unrealized loss on the Teva Shares due to a decline in share price, which was recorded as a component of  Other comprehensive income.  The Company currently considers the decline in value of its investment in Teva securities to be temporary.  We will continue to monitor the value of this investment to determine if the decline in value becomes other than temporary. 
 We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and recognize losses, for income statement purposes, when events and circumstances indicate that any declines in the fair values of such investments below our accounting basis are other than temporary. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our non-equity investment portfolio and our floating rate debt. Our cash is invested in bank deposits and A-rated or better money market mutual funds. 
 Our portfolio of marketable securities includes U.S. treasury and agency securities classified as available-for-sale securities, with no security having a maturity in excess of two years. These securities are exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Because of the short-term nature of these investments, we are subject to minimal interest rate risk and do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the realized value of our portfolio. 
 Floating Rate Debt 
 At December 31, 2016, borrowings outstanding under the floating rate notes were $1,000.0 million. Assuming a one percent increase in the applicable interest rate on the Company s floating rates notes, annual interest expense would increase by approximately $10.0 million over the next twelve months. 
 Fixed Rate Debt 
 The Company has outstanding borrowings under its fixed rate notes. Changes in market interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. 
 96 

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  
 Overall, we are a net recipient of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect our consolidated revenues or operating costs and expenses as expressed in U.S. dollars. 
 From time to time, we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management to focus its attention on our core business issues. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to allow the Company at its option to economically offset the effect of changes in the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses. We enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures.   
 At times we use foreign currency option contracts, which provide for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies, if exercised, to economically hedge the currency exchange risks associated with probable but not firmly committed transactions that arise in the normal course of our business. Probable but not firmly committed transactions are comprised primarily of sales of products and purchases of raw material in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The foreign currency option contracts are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily earnings denominated in the Euro. While these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures.   
 Net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014, respectively.

ITEM 9A.   
 
      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Allergan plc maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Allergan plc s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Allergan plc s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective. 
 As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Allergan plc carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Allergan plc s management, including Allergan plc s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Allergan plc s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on this evaluation Allergan plc s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that Allergan plc s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2016 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Warner Chilcott Limited maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Warner Chilcott Limited s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), Warner Chilcott Limited carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Warner Chilcott Limited s management, including Warner Chilcott Limited s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Warner Chilcott Limited s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on this evaluation Warner Chilcott Limited s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that Warner Chilcott Limited s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2016 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.  
 Management s Reports on Internal Control over Financial Reporting of Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. We maintain internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  
 Management of Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited has assessed the effectiveness of Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on criteria set forth in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting management concluded that Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited did not maintain effective controls to appropriately assess the tax implications of certain transactions between our subsidiaries. This control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of our current or prior period consolidated financial statements. However, this control deficiency could have resulted in a misstatement to the income tax accounts and disclosures, which would have resulted in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.     
 Because of the above described material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016.  
 The effectiveness of  Allergan plc  s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. 
 Material Weakness Remediation 
 Management has begun to take steps to remediate the material weakness, including adding resources and enhancing existing controls and income tax reporting policies and procedures to ensure the implications of certain transactions between our subsidiaries are fully analyzed.    While we have made significant progress, the material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the enhanced controls have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting of Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited 
 During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited s internal control over financial reporting.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 The following Consolidated Financial Statements of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are required to be included in Item 15: 

F-1 

Report of Independent Regis  tered Public Accounting Firm  
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Allergan plc: 
 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), stockholders  equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Allergan plc and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the assessment of tax implications of certain transactions between its subsidiaries existed as of that date.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2016 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As a result of the Allergan Acquisition, the Company expanded its franchises to include ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery, which complements the Company s central nervous system, gastroenterology, women s health and urology franchises. The Company benefits significantly from our global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox    and Restasis   .  
 On July 26, 2015 we entered into a master purchase agreement (the  Teva Agreement ), under which Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ( Teva ) agreed to acquire our global generic pharmaceuticals business and certain other assets (the  Teva Transaction ).  Upon the closing of the Teva Transaction on August 2, 2016, we received $33.3 billion in cash, net of cash acquired by Teva, which includes estimated working capital and other contractual adjustments, and 100.3 million unregistered Teva ordinary shares (or American depository Shares with respect thereto), which approximated $5.0 billion in value using the closing date Teva opening stock price discounted at a rate of 5.9 percent due to the lack of marketability.   
 On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business to Teva for $500.0 million. Teva acquired our Anda Distribution business, which distributes generic, branded, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from more than 300 manufacturers to retail independent and chain pharmacies, nursing homes, mail order pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and physician offices across the U.S.  
 The Company recognized a combined gain on the sale of the Anda Distribution business and the sale of our global generics business of $15,932.2 million as well as deferred liabilities relating to other elements of our arrangements with Teva of $299.2 million. 
 As part of the Teva Transaction, Teva acquired our global generics business, including the United States ( U.S. ) and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic research and development ( R D ) unit, our international OTC commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and certain established international brands. 
 As a result of the Teva Transaction and the divestiture of the Company s Anda Distribution business, and in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) number 2014-08  Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity , the Company accounted for the assets and liabilities divested as held for sale as of December 31, 2015.  Further, the financial results of the businesses held for sale have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. The results of our discontinued operations include the results of our generic product development, manufacturing and distribution of off-patent pharmaceutical products, certain established international brands marketed similarly to generic products and out-licensed generic pharmaceutical products primarily in Europe through our Medis third-party business through August 2, 2016, as well as our Anda Distribution business through October 3, 2016. 

NOTE 2   Formation of the Company 
 Allergan plc (formerly known as Actavis plc) was incorporated in Ireland on May 16, 2013 as a private limited company and re-registered effective September 20, 2013 as a public limited company. It was established for the purpose of facilitating the business combination between Allergan Finance, LLC (formerly known as Actavis, Inc.) and Warner Chilcott plc ( Warner Chilcott ). On October 1, 2013, pursuant to the transaction agreement dated May 19, 2013 among Allergan Finance, LLC (formerly known as Actavis, Inc.), Warner Chilcott, the Company, Actavis Ireland Holding Limited, Actavis W.C. Holding LLC (now known as Actavis W.C. Holding Inc.) and Actavis W.C. Holding 2 LLC (now known as Actavis W.C. Holding 2 Inc.), (i) the Company acquired Warner Chilcott (the  Warner Chilcott Acquisition ) pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Section 201, and a capital reduction under Sections 72 and 74, of the Irish Companies Act of 1963, where each Warner Chilcott ordinary share was converted into 0.160 of an Allergan plc ordinary share (the  Company Ordinary Shares ), or $5,833.9 million in equity consideration, and (ii) Actavis W.C. Holding 2 Inc. merged with and into Allergan Finance, LLC, with Allergan Finance, LLC as the surviving corporation in the merger (the  Merger  and, together with the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, the  Warner Chilcott Transactions ). Following the consummation of the Warner Chilcott Transactions, Allergan Finance, LLC and Warner Chilcott became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Allergan plc. Each of Allergan Finance, LLC s common shares was converted into one Company Ordinary Share. Effective October 1, 2013, through a series of related-party transactions, Allergan plc contributed its indirect subsidiaries, including Allergan Finance, LLC, to its subsidiary Warner Chilcott Limited.

Except where otherwise indicated, and excluding certain insignificant cash and non-cash transactions at the Allergan     plc     level, the consolidated financial statements and disclosures are for two separate registrants, Allergan plc     and Warner     Chilcott     Limited. The results of Warner     Chilcott     Limited are consolidated into the results of Allergan plc. Due to the     deminimis     activity between Allergan     plc     and Warner     Chilcott     Limited, references throughout this document relate to both Allergan     plc     and Warner     Chilcott     Limited. Refer to  Note 3  Reconciliation of Warner     Chilcott     Limited results to Allergan     plc     results  in the accompanying  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  in this document for a summary of the details on the differences between Allergan     plc     and Warner     Chilcott     Limited.  
 On March 17, 2015, the Company acquired Legacy Allergan for approximately $77.0 billion including outstanding indebtedness assumed of $2.2 billion, cash consideration of $40.1 billion and equity consideration of $34.7 billion, which includes outstanding equity awards (the  Allergan Acquisition ). Under the terms of the agreement, Legacy Allergan shareholders received 111.2 million of the Company s ordinary shares, 7.0 million of the Company s non-qualified stock options and 0.5 million of the Company s share units. The addition of Legacy Allergan s therapeutic franchises in ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery complements the Company s existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women s health and urology franchises. The combined company benefits from Legacy Allergan s global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox      and Restasis     . The transaction expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America. 
 In connection with the Allergan Acquisition, the Company changed its name from Actavis plc to Allergan plc.  Actavis plc s ordinary shares were traded on the NYSE under the symbol  ACT  until the opening of trading on June 15, 2015, at which time Actavis plc changed its corporate name to  Allergan plc  and changed its ticker symbol to  AGN.   Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), Allergan plc is the successor issuer to Actavis plc s ordinary shares which are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Allergan plc is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 References throughout to  we,   our,   us,  the  Company  or  Allergan  refer to financial information and transactions of Allergan plc. References to  Warner Chilcott Limited  refer to Warner Chilcott Limited, the Company s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries. 
 References throughout to  Ordinary Shares  refer to Allergan Finance, LLC s Class A common shares, par value $0.0033 per share, prior to the consummation of the Warner Chilcott Transactions and to Allergan plc s ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, since the consummation of the Warner Chilcott Transactions. 

NOTE 3   Reconciliation of Warner Chilcott Limited results to Allergan plc results 
 Warner Chilcott Limited is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc (together with other Warner Chilcott Limited parents, the  Parent ), the ultimate parent of the group. The results of Warner Chilcott Limited are consolidated into the results of Allergan plc. Due to the deminimis activity between Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited, references throughout this filing relate to both Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. Warner Chilcott Limited representations relate only to itself and not to any other company. 
 Except where otherwise indicated, and excluding certain insignificant cash and non-cash transactions at the Allergan plc level, these notes relate to the consolidated financial statements for both separate registrants, Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. In addition to certain inter-company payable and receivable amounts between the entities, the following is a reconciliation of the results of Warner Chilcott Limited to Allergan plc ($ in millions): 

F-15 

The difference between general and administrative expenses in the years ending December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were due to corporate related expenses incurred at Allergan plc as well as non-recurring transaction costs incurred as part of the acquisitions of the Company, including Allergan, Forest and the terminated transaction with Pfizer Inc. Movements in equity are due to historical differences in the results of operations of the companies and differences in equity awards. 
   
 As of December 31, 2016, Warner Chilcott Limited had $9.3 billion in Receivables from Parents and $4.0 billion in Non-current Receivables from Parents.  These receivables related to intercompany loans between Allergan plc and Actavis Capital, S.a.r.l and Forest Finance BV, subsidiaries of Warner Chilcott Limited.  These loans are interest-bearing loans with varying term dates.  Total interest income recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $41.2 million.   

NOTE 4   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of wholly owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects all financial information that, in the opinion of management, is necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements include the financial results of all acquired companies subsequent to the acquisition date. 
 Reclassifications  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which changes the classification of debt issuance costs from being an asset on the balance sheet to netting the costs against the carrying value of the debt. As a result, the Company reclassified debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2015 by decreasing  prepaid expenses and other current assets  and  current portion of long-term debt and capital leases  by $36.3 million as well as decreasing  investments and other assets  and  long-term debt and capital leases  by $159.5 million.  In addition, the Company made certain presentation reclassifications relating to segment results and guarantor financial statements.  
 Use of Estimates 
 Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported financial statements. The Company s most significant estimates relate to the determination of SRA s (defined below) included within either accounts receivable or accrued liabilities, the valuation of inventory balances, the determination of useful lives for intangible assets, pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment and recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at fair value. The estimation process required to prepare the Company s consolidated financial statements requires assumptions to be made about future events and conditions, and as such, is inherently subjective and uncertain. The Company s actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 F-16 

Foreign Currency Translation  
 For most of the Company s international operations, the local currency has been determined to be the functional currency. The results of its non-U.S. dollar based operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Equity is translated at the prevailing rate of exchange at the date of the equity transaction. Translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders  equity and are included as a component of other comprehensive (loss) / income. The effects of revaluing non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 The Company realizes foreign currency gains / (losses) in the normal course of business based on movement in the applicable exchange rates. These transactional gains / (losses) are included as a component of general and administrative expenses. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash in banks, commercial paper and deposits with financial institutions that can be liquidated without prior notice or penalty. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
 The Company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts and other receivables, investments, trade accounts payable, and long-term debt, including the current portion. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts and other receivables and trade accounts payable are representative of their respective fair values due to their relatively short maturities. The fair values of investments in companies that are publicly traded and not accounted for under the equity method are based on quoted market prices. The Company estimates the fair value of its fixed rate long-term obligations based on quoted market rates.  
 Inventories 
 Inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution, raw materials and work in process. Inventory includes brand pharmaceutical and medical aesthetic products which represent Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved or likely to be approved indications. Inventory valuation reserves are established based on a number of factors/situations including, but not limited to, raw materials, work in process or finished goods not meeting product specifications, product obsolescence, or application of the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value) concepts. The determination of events requiring the establishment of inventory valuation reserves, together with the calculation of the amount of such reserves may require judgment. Assumptions utilized in our quantification of inventory reserves include, but are not limited to, estimates of future product demand, consideration of current and future market conditions, product net selling price, anticipated product launch dates, potential product obsolescence and other events relating to special circumstances surrounding certain products. No material adjustments have been required to our inventory reserve estimates for the periods presented. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to our inventory valuation reserves and higher cost of sales. 
 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest on qualified construction projects. At the time property, plant and equipment are retired from service, the cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts. 
 Depreciation expense is computed principally on the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The following table provides the range of estimated useful lives used for each asset type: 

Computer software/hardware (including internally developed)  

3-10 years  

Machinery and equipment  

3-15 years  

Research and laboratory equipment  

3-10 years  

Furniture and fixtures  

3-10 years  

Buildings, improvements, leasehold improvements and other  

4-50 years  

Transportation equipment  

3-20 years  

F-17 

The Company assesses property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
 Investments 
 The Company s equity investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting when the Company can exert significant influence and the Company s ownership interest does not exceed 50%. The Company records equity method investments at cost and adjusts for the appropriate share of investee net earnings or losses. Investments in which the Company owns less than a 20% interest and cannot exert significant influence are accounted for using the cost method if the fair value of such investments is not readily determinable. 
 Marketable Securities  
 The Company s marketable securities consist of U.S. treasury and agency securities and debt and equity securities of publicly-held companies. The Company s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value, based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized temporary adjustments to fair value are included on the balance sheet in a separate component of stockholders  equity as unrealized gains and losses and are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income / (loss). No gains or losses on marketable securities are realized until shares are sold or a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. 
 Product Rights and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 Our product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization, and are amortized using the economic benefit model or the straight-line method, if results are materially aligned, over their estimated useful lives. We determine amortization periods for product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows. Such factors include the product s position in its life cycle, the existence or absence of like products in the market, various other competitive and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangibles useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our net results to decline. 
 Product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not recoverable and an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The computed impairment loss is recognized in net (loss) / income in the period that the impairment occurs. Assets which are not impaired may require an adjustment to the remaining useful lives for which to amortize the asset. Our projections of discounted cash flows use a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model. Our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other definite-lived intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors. Different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of the other definite-lived intangible assets which could trigger impairment. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives 
 The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually in the second quarter by comparing the fair value of each of the Company s reporting units to the respective carrying value of the reporting units. Additionally, the Company may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when the Company has a change to reporting units. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units. 
 Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and this could result in a material impact to net (loss) / income and (loss) / earnings per share. 
   Acquired IPR D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the date acquired, represent the right to develop, use, sell and/or offer for sale a product or other intellectual property that the Company has acquired with respect to products and/or processes that have not been completed or approved. The IPR D intangible assets are subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of each project. Upon abandonment, the assets are impaired.  
 F-18 

Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows for each year for each project or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R D costs, selling and marketing costs and other costs which may be allocated), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset s life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, and competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the IPR D projects include legal risk, market risk and regulatory risk. Changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment charges. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.  
 Upon successful completion of each project and approval of the product, we will make a separate determination of the useful life of the intangible, transfer the amount to currently marketed products ( CMP ) and amortization expense will be recorded over the estimated useful life. 
 Warranties 
 The Company provides warranty programs for breast implant sales primarily in the United States, Europe and certain other countries. Management estimates the amount of potential future claims from these warranty programs based on actuarial analyses. Expected future obligations are determined based on the history of product shipments and claims and are discounted to a current value. The provision for warranty expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $6.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively.  The liability is included in both current and long-term liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $2.2 million and $28.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, and $7.6 million and $28.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The U.S. programs include the  ConfidencePlus     and  ConfidencePlus     Premier warranty programs. The  ConfidencePlus     program, which is limited to saline breast implants, currently provides lifetime product replacement and contralateral implant replacement. The  ConfidencePlus     Premier program, which is standard for silicone gel implants and requires a low enrollment fee for saline breast implants, generally provides lifetime product replacement, $2,400 of financial assistance for saline breast implants and $3,500 of financial assistance for silicone gel breast implants for surgical procedures within ten years of implantation and contralateral implant replacement. The warranty programs in non-U.S. markets generally have similar terms and conditions to the U.S. programs. The Company does not warrant any level of aesthetic result and, as required by government regulation, makes extensive disclosures concerning the risks of the use of its products and breast implant surgery. Changes to actual warranty claims incurred and interest rates could have a material impact on the actuarial analysis and the Company s estimated liabilities. A large majority of the product warranty liability arises from the U.S. warranty programs. The Company does not currently offer any similar warranty program on any other product. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 Contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date estimated fair value of the contingent payment for all applicable acquisitions. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period with any adjustments in fair value included in our consolidated statement of operations. (Refer to  NOTE 23   Fair Value Measurement  for additional details regarding the fair value of contingent consideration.) 
 Revenue Recognition  
 General 
 Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss to the product transfers to the customer, which is based on the transaction shipping terms. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds, the seller s price to the buyer to be fixed or determinable and the completion of all performance obligations. The Company warrants products against defects and for specific quality standards, permitting the return of products under certain circumstances. Product sales are recorded net of all sales-related deductions including, but not limited to: chargebacks, trade discounts, sales returns and allowances, commercial and government rebates, customer loyalty programs and fee-for-service arrangements with certain distributors, which we refer to in the aggregate as  SRA  allowances. 
 Royalty and commission revenue is recognized as a component of net revenues in accordance with the terms of their respective contractual agreements when collectability is reasonably assured and when revenue can be reasonably measured. 
 F-19 

Provisions for SRAs  
 As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes gross revenue from the sale of products, an estimate of SRA is recorded, which reduces the product revenues. Accounts receivable and/or accrued liabilities are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount depending on whether we have the right of offset with the customer. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship of the deductions to gross product revenues, government regulations, estimated utilization or redemption rates, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms. The estimation process used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on a consistent basis and no material revenue adjustments have been necessary to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company uses a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of the SRA reserves to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated. 
 Chargebacks    A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesaler s customer pays for that product. The chargeback provision and related reserve varies with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at certain contract prices. The Company validates the chargeback accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent the vast majority of the recipients of the Company s chargeback payments. We continually monitor current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.  
 Rebates    Rebates include volume related incentives to direct and indirect customers, third-party managed care and Medicare Part D rebates, Medicaid rebates and other government rebates. Rebates are accrued based on an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into trade by the Company. Volume rebates are generally offered to customers as an incentive to use the Company s products and to encourage greater product sales. These rebate programs include contracted rebates based on customers  purchases made during an applicable monthly, quarterly or annual period. The provision for third-party rebates is estimated based on our customers  contracted rebate programs and the Company s historical experience of rebates paid. Any significant changes to our customer rebate programs are considered in establishing the provision for rebates. The provisions for government rebates are based, in part, upon historical experience of claims submitted by the various states / authorities, contractual terms and government regulations. We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on our provision.  
 Cash Discounts    Cash discounts are provided to customers that pay within a specific period. The provision for cash discounts is estimated based upon invoice billings and historical customer payment experience. The Company s experience of payment history is fairly consistent and most customer payments qualify for the cash discount.  
 Returns and Other Allowances    The Company s provision for returns and other allowances include returns, promotional allowances, and loyalty cards.  
 Consistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers to return product for a credit. In accordance with the Company s policy, credits for customer returns of products are applied against outstanding account activity or are settled in cash. Product exchanges are not permitted. Customer returns of product are generally not resalable. The Company s estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience and current trends of actual customer returns. Additionally, we consider other factors when estimating the current period returns provision, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, as well as significant market changes which may impact future expected returns. 
 Promotional allowances are credits that are issued in connection with a product launch or as an incentive for customers to carry our product. The Company establishes a reserve for promotional allowances based upon contractual terms. 
 Loyalty cards allow the end user patients a discount per prescription and are accrued based on historical experience, contract terms and the volume of product and cards in the distribution channel.

The Company s divested generics business also had the following type of SRA s:  

Pricing adjustments, included shelf stock adjustments which are credits issued to reflect price decreases in selling prices charged to the Company s direct customers. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product our customers have in their inventory at the time of an agreed-upon price reduction. The provision for shelf stock adjustments was based upon specific terms with the Company s customers and includes estimates of existing customer inventory levels based upon their historical purchasing patterns.      

Billback adjustments are credits that are issued to certain customers who purchase directly from us as well as indirectly through a wholesaler. These credits are issued in the event there was a difference between the customer s direct and indirect contract price. The provision for billbacks was estimated based upon historical purchasing patterns of qualified customers who purchase product directly from us and supplement their purchases indirectly through our wholesale customers.       

 Branded Prescription Drug Fee 
 On July 28, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) issued revised final rules and regulations for the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, an annual fee payable to the federal government based on an allocation of the Company s market share for branded prescription and authorized generic drugs sold to certain government programs compared to that of the industry. The final rules accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation from the year in which the fee is paid, to the year in which the market share used to allocate the fee is determined. This change required Allergan (and other industry participants) to recognize an additional year of expense in the third quarter of 2014 of $105.1 million, which is reflected in our 2014 selling and marketing expense. 
 Litigation and Contingencies 
 The Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of its business, including product liability litigation, intellectual property litigation, employment litigation and other litigation. Additionally, the Company, in consultation with its counsel, assesses the need to record a liability for contingencies on a case-by-case basis in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 450  Contingencies  ( ASC 450 ). Accruals are recorded when the Company determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or as additional information becomes available. Acquired contingencies in business combinations are recorded at fair value to the extent determinable, otherwise in accordance with ASC 450. Refer to  NOTE 24   Commitments and Contingencies  for more information. 
 R D Activities 
 R D activities are expensed as incurred and consist of self-funded R D costs, the costs associated with work performed under collaborative R D agreements, regulatory fees, and license and milestone payments, if any.

 We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values as determined using a market participant concept. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
 The most material line items impacted by the allocation of acquisition fair values are: 

Intangible assets (including IPR D assets upon successful completion of the project and approval of the product) which are amortized to amortization expense over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates used to present value expected future net cash flow streams, the timing of approvals for IPR D projects and the timing of related product launch dates, the assessment of each asset s life cycle, the impact of competitive trends on each asset s life cycle and other factors. These judgments can materially impact the estimates used to allocate acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the future useful lives. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.     

Fixed asset valuations which are depreciated over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates and intended uses of the assets.     

Inventory is recorded at fair market value factoring in selling price and costs to dispose. Inventory acquired is typically valued higher than replacement cost.     

 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the Company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company s effective tax rate on future earnings. 
 F-23 

Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.  
 Comprehensive Income / (Loss) 
 Comprehensive income / (loss) includes all changes in equity during a period except those that resulted from investments by or distributions to the Company s stockholders. Other comprehensive income / (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included in comprehensive income / (loss), but excluded from net income / (loss) as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders  equity. The Company s other comprehensive income / (loss) is comprised of unrealized gains / (losses) on certain holdings of publicly traded equity securities, investments in U.S. treasury and agency securities and actuarial gains/(losses), net of realized gains / (losses) included in net income / (loss), net of tax and foreign currency translation adjustments. 
 Earnings Per Share ( EPS ) 
 The Company computes EPS in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share  ( ASC 260 ) and related guidance, which requires two calculations of EPS to be disclosed: basic and diluted. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net (loss) / income by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding during a period. Diluted EPS is based on the treasury stock method and includes the effect from potential issuance of ordinary shares, such as shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units. Diluted EPS also includes the impact of ordinary share equivalents to be issued upon the mandatory conversion of the Company s preferred shares. Ordinary share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive to continuing operations. 
 A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted EPS consisted of the following ($ in millions, except per share amounts):  

Stock awards to purchase 4.7 million ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2016 were outstanding, but not included in the computation of diluted EPS, because the awards were anti-dilutive for continuing operations and as such the treatment for discontinued operations is also anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has repurchased 61.6 million shares under the Company s share repurchase program.  The impact of the share repurchase on basic EPS was 10.7 million weighted average shares for the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to  NOTE 19  Shareholder s Equity  for further discussion on the Company s Share Repurchase Program. The impact of the Share Repurchase Program was anti-dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 F-24 

Stock awards to purchase/acquire 5.2 million and 3.0 million ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were outstanding, but not included in the computation of diluted EPS, because the awards were anti-dilutive for continuing operations and as such the treatment for discontinued operations is also anti-dilutive.     
 The weighted average impact of ordinary share equivalents of 17.6 million and 13.6 million for year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are anticipated to result from the mandatory conversion of the Company s preferred shares were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would be anti-dilutive.  
 Employee Benefits 
 Defined Contribution Plans 
 The Company has defined contribution plans that are post-employment benefit plans under which the Company pays fixed contributions to a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of operations in the periods during which the related services were rendered. 
 Defined Benefit Plans 
 The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheets. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. The estimates of the obligation and related expense of these plans recorded in the financial statements are based on certain assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Other assumptions used may include employee demographic factors such as compensation rate increases, retirement patterns, expected employee turnover and participant mortality rates. The difference between these assumptions and actual experience results in the recognition of an asset or liability based upon a net actuarial (gain) / loss. If the total net actuarial (gain) / loss included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) / income exceeds a threshold of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets, it is subject to amortization and recorded as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service lives of the employees participating in the pension plan. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 Share-based Compensation 
 The Company has adopted several equity award plans which authorize the granting of options, restricted shares, restricted stock units and other forms of equity awards of the Company s ordinary shares, subject to certain conditions. 
 The Company grants or has granted awards with the following features: 

Time-based vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units awards;     

Performance-based restricted stock unit awards measured to the EBITDA, as defined, of the Company or other performance-based targets defined by the Company;     

Performance-based restricted stock unit awards based on pre-established total shareholder returns metrics;     

Non-qualified options to purchase outstanding shares; and     

Cash-settled awards recorded as a liability. These cash settled awards are based on pre-established total shareholder returns metrics.     

 The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for the granted awards over the applicable vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimates of anticipated vesting of awards are revised in future periods based on actual forfeiture rates and targets achieved. 
 F-25 

Restructuring Costs  
 The Company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. In accordance with existing benefit arrangements, employee severance costs are accrued when the restructuring actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. The Company also incurs costs with contract terminations and costs of transferring products as part of restructuring activities. Refer to  NOTE 21   Business Restructuring Charges  for more information. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
 On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), with an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was deferred by one year through the issuance of ASU 2015-14, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued multiple updates which are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance, and to provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients, which include guidance on principal versus agent considerations; identifying performance obligations; licensing implementation guidance; assessing the specific collectability criterion and accounting for certain contracts; presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers; noncash consideration; contract modifications at transition and completed contracts at transition. The guidance provides clarification that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption, however, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the new revenue guidance.  The majority of the Company s revenue relates to the sale of finished product to various customers and we do not believe that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on these transactions.  The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of certain less significant transactions involving collaboration arrangements, warranties, as well as certain rebates and discounts offered.  The Company expects to adopt the standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which changes the requirement to require equity securities (including other ownership interests, such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures, and limited liability companies) to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which states that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. This guidance eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when there is an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The Company has assessed the implementation impact on Retained Earnings noting a reduction in retained earnings of $62.4 million on January 1, 2017.  
   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.   The ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets including trade receivables held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward- 
 F-26 

looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates.     The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.      Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations.  
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in GAAP. The amendments require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. Two common examples of assets included in the scope of the amendments are intellectual property and property, plant, and equipment. The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations .  
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, clarifying the definition of a business. The amendments are intended to help companies evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business. This introduces an initial required screening that, if met, eliminates the need for further assessment. To be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. To be a business without outputs, there will need to be an organized workforce. The ASU also narrows the definition of the term  outputs  to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. The changes to the definition of a business may result in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions. 
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle should be disclosed upon transition. The amendments are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the amendments will have on our financial positions and results of operations.

2016 Significant Business Developments  
 The following are the material transactions that were completed in the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to  NOTE 7   Discontinued Operations  for material divestitures that were completed / entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 Acquisitions 
 Tobira   Therapeutics, Inc.    
 On November 1, 2016, the Company acquired Tobira Therapeutics, Inc. ( Tobira ), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) and other liver diseases for an acquisition accounting purchase price of $570.1 million, plus contingent consideration of up to $49.84 per share in contingent value rights ( CVR ), or up to $1,101.3 million, that may be payable based on the successful completion of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (the  Tobira Acquisition ). The CVR had an acquisition date fair value of $479.0 million. The acquisition adds Cenicriviroc and Evogliptin, two differentiated, complementary development programs for the treatment of the multi-factorial elements of NASH, including inflammation, metabolic syndromes and fibrosis, to Allergan's global Gastroenterology R D pipeline.  
 Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed at Fair Value 
 The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2016, certain amounts relating to the valuation of tax related matters and intangible assets have not been finalized. The finalization of these matters may result in changes to goodwill. 
 The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date ($ in millions): 

IPR D and Intangible Assets 
 IPR D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired R D projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not established technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The IPR D intangible assets are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will be subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project and launch of the product, the Company will make a separate determination of the estimated useful life of the IPR D intangible asset and the related amortization will be recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life ( IPR D Acquisition Accounting ). 
   The estimated fair value of the IPR D intangible assets was determined using the  income approach,  which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset  
 F-28 

would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R D costs, selling and marketing costs, other allocated costs, and working capital/asset contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset s life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors (the  IPR D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique ).  
 The fair value of the IPR D intangible assets was determined using the IPR D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique. The discount rate used to arrive at the present value for IPR D intangible assets was 11.5% to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty in the cash flow projections. The discount rate of the acquisition was driven by the stage of the product and the therapeutic indication. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.   
 Goodwill 
 Among the reasons the Company acquired Tobira and the factors that contributed to the preliminary recognition of goodwill was the expansion of the Company s pipeline of NASH products.  Goodwill from the Tobira Acquisition of $112.7 million was assigned to the US General Medicine segment and is non-deductible for tax purposes. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 As part of the acquisition, the Company is required to pay the former shareholders of Tobira up to $1,101.3 million based on the timing of the certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, if any.  The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration to be $479.0 million using a probability weighted average approach that considered the possible outcomes of scenarios related to the specified product. 
 Long-Term Deferred Tax Liabilities and Other Tax Liabilities 
 Long-term deferred tax liabilities and other tax liabilities result from identifiable intangible assets  fair value adjustments. These adjustments create excess book basis over the tax basis which is multiplied by the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the deferred taxes exist. 
 Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc.    
 On October 25, 2016, the Company   acquired   Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   ( Vitae ), a clinical-stage   biotechnology company for   an acquisition accounting purchase price of $621.4 million   (the  Vitae   Acquisition ). The acquisition   strengthens   Allergan s dermatology product pipeline, with the addition of a Phase II, orally active   RORyt   (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma) inhibitor for the potential treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders. In addition, the Company expanded its pipeline with the acquisition of a Phase II atopic dermatitis drug candidate.    
 Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed at Fair Value 
 The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2016, certain amounts relating to the valuation of tax related matters and intangible assets have not been finalized. The finalization of these matters may result in changes to goodwill. 
 F-29 

The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date ($ in millions):  

IPR D and Intangible Assets 
 The fair value of the IPR D intangible assets was determined using the IPR D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique. The discount rate used to arrive at the present value for IPR D intangible assets was 9.5% to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty in the cash flow projections. The discount rate of the acquisition was driven by the stage of the product and the therapeutic indication. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.   
 Goodwill 
 Among the reasons the Company acquired Vitae and the factors that contributed to the preliminary recognition of goodwill was the expansion of the Company s pipeline of dermatology products.  Goodwill from the Vitae Acquisition of $34.4 million was assigned to the US Specialized Therapeutic segment and is non-deductible for tax purposes. 
 Long-Term Deferred Tax Liabilities and Other Tax Liabilities 
 Long-term deferred tax liabilities and other tax liabilities result from identifiable intangible assets  fair value adjustments. These adjustments create excess book basis over the tax basis which is multiplied by the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the deferred taxes exist. 
 Assets held for sale 
 The Company held for sale certain intangible assets acquired as part of the Vitae Acquisition.  These assets had an acquisition accounting value of $22.5 million. Actual amounts to be received, if any, may change. 
   
 ForSight VISION5, Inc. 
 On September 23, 2016, the Company acquired ForSight VISION5, Inc. ( ForSight ), a privately held, clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on eye care, in an all cash transaction of approximately $95.0 million. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired ForSight for an acquisition accounting purchase price of $74.5 million plus the payment of outstanding indebtedness of $14.8 million and other miscellaneous charges. ForSight shareholders are eligible to receive contingent consideration of up to $125.0 million, which has an initial estimated fair value of $79.8 million, relating to commercialization milestones (the  ForSight Acquisition ). The Company acquired ForSight for its lead development program, a peri-ocular ring designed for extended drug delivery and reducing elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in glaucoma patients.  
 Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed at Fair Value 
 The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.  
 F-30 

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date ($ in millions):  

IPR D and Intangible Assets 
 The fair value of the IPR D intangible assets was determined using the IPR D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique. The discount rate used to arrive at the present value for IPR D intangible assets was 13.0% to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty in the cash flow projections. The discount rate of the acquisition was driven by the early stage of the product and the therapeutic indication. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.   
 Goodwill 
 Among the reasons the Company acquired ForSight and the factors that contributed to the preliminary recognition of goodwill was the expansion of the Company s pipeline of eye care products.  Goodwill from the ForSight Acquisition of $51.6 million was assigned to the US Specialized Therapeutics segment and is non-deductible for tax purposes. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 As part of the acquisition, the Company is required to pay the former shareholders of ForSight up to $125.0 million based on the timing of the first commercial sale, if any.  The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration to be $79.8 million using a probability weighted average approach that considered the possible outcomes of scenarios related to the specified product.  The Company recognized approximately $33.0 million in impairments of the acquired ForSight IPR D asset as the Company anticipates a delay in potential launch timing, if any.  Offsetting this impairment was a corresponding reduction of acquired contingent consideration of $15.0 million, which reduced overall R D expenses.  
   Long-Term Deferred Tax Liabilities and Other Tax Liabilities 
 Long-term deferred tax liabilities and other tax liabilities result from identifiable intangible assets  fair value adjustments. These adjustments create excess book basis over the tax basis which is multiplied by the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the deferred taxes exist. 
 Licenses and Asset Acquisitions 
 Motus   Therapeutics, Inc. 
 On December 15, 2016, the Company acquired Motus Therapeutics, Inc. ( Motus ) for an upfront payment of approximately $200.0 million.  Motus has the worldwide rights to RM-131 (relamorelin), a peptide ghrelin agonist being developed by Motus for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis.  Under the terms of the agreement, Motus is eligible to receive contingent consideration in connection with the commercial launch of the product (the  Motus Transaction ). The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business. The total upfront net payment of $199.5 million was expensed as a component of R D expense and the future milestone will be recorded if the corresponding event becomes probable. 
 Chase Pharmaceuticals  Corporation  
   On November 22, 2016, the Company   acquired Chase Pharmaceuticals Corporation, ( Chase )   a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on   the development of improved treatments for neurodegenerative disorders including  
 F-31 

Alzheimer's disease,     for an upfront payment of approximately     $125.0     million     plus potential regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $875.0 million     related to Chase's lead compound, CPC-201, and certain backup compounds     (the  Chase Transaction ).     The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business. The total upfront net payment of  $122.9 million was expensed as a component of R D expense and the future milestones will be recorded if the corresponding events become probable.  
 AstraZeneca   License 
 On October 2, 2016, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with MedImmune, AstraZeneca's global biologics research and development arm, for the global rights to Brazikumab ( AstraZeneca License ). Brazikumab is an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease and is Phase II ready for ulcerative colitis and other conditions treated with anti-IL23 monoclonal antibodies.  Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca received $250.0 million for the exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize Brazikumab and is eligible to receive contingent consideration of up to $1.27 billion, payable over a period of up to 15 years, including development and launch milestone payments of up to $540.0 million and sales-based milestone payments of $725.0 million, as well as tiered royalties on sales of the product   (the    AstraZeneca   License Transaction ).   The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees and manufacturing as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business. The total upfront payment of $250.0 million was expensed as a component of R D expense and the future milestones will be recorded if the corresponding events become probable. 
 RetroSense Therapeutics, LLC 
 On September 6, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of RetroSense Therapeutics LLC ( RetroSense ), a private, clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on novel gene therapy approaches to restore vision in patients suffering from blindness. Under the terms of the transaction, RetroSense received approximately $60.0 million upfront, and is eligible to receive up to $495.0 million in contingent regulatory and commercialization milestone payments related to its lead development program, RST-001, a novel gene therapy for the treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa (the  RetroSense Transaction ).  The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business.  The total upfront net payment of $59.7 million was expensed as a component of R D expense and the future milestones will be recorded if the corresponding events become probable. 
   
 Akarna Therapeutics, Ltd 
 On August 26, 2016, the Company acquired Akarna Therapeutics, Ltd ( Akarna ), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapeutics that target inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Under the terms of the transaction, Akarna shareholders received approximately $50.0 million upfront and are eligible to receive contingent development and commercialization milestones of up to $1,015.0 million (the  Akarna Transaction ). The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets as well as a lack of certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business.  The total upfront net payment of $48.2 million was expensed as a component of R D expense and the future milestones will be recorded if the corresponding events become probable. 
   
 Topokine Therapeutics, Inc.

 In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received a schedule IV ( C-IV ) designation from the Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) for Viberzi    and recognized an expense of $29.8 million as a component of R D expense.  This expense represents the difference between the final CVR payment amount of $118.5 million, or $10 for each CVR outstanding, versus the probability-weighted CVR fair value initially established in acquisition accounting, adjusted for accretion.  
 Long-Term Deferred Tax Liabilities and Other Tax Liabilities  
 Long-term deferred tax liabilities and other tax liabilities result from identifiable intangible assets fair value adjustments. These adjustments create excess book basis over the tax basis which is multiplied by the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the deferred taxes exist.  
 Forest Laboratories, Inc. 
 On July 1, 2014, the Company acquired Forest Laboratories, Inc. ( Legacy Forest ) for $30.9 billion including outstanding indebtedness assumed of $3.3 billion, equity consideration of $20.6 billion, which includes outstanding equity awards, and cash consideration of $7.1 billion (the  Forest Acquisition ). Under the terms of the transaction, Legacy Forest shareholders received 89.8 million Allergan plc ordinary shares, 6.1 million Allergan plc non-qualified stock options and 1.1 million Allergan plc share units. Legacy Forest was a leading, fully integrated, specialty pharmaceutical company largely focused on the United States market. Legacy Forest marketed a portfolio of branded drug products and developed new medicines to treat patients suffering from diseases principally in the following therapeutic areas: central nervous system, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, anti-infective, and cystic fibrosis. A portion of the assets acquired were divested as part of the Teva Transaction. 
 Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed at Fair Value 
 The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, of which the majority of the assets and liabilities relate to continuing operations. ($ in millions): 

In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment in the final valuation of Forest stated in the table above relating to the valuation of an acquired currently marketed product and deferred tax liabilities.  The Company over valued the asset and undervalued goodwill based on information available as of the acquisition date.  The Company corrected this error as of December 31, 2015 by decreasing the value of intangible assets by $135.0 million, decreasing deferred tax liabilities by $51.4 million and increasing the value of goodwill by $83.6 million. The impact was not material to the statement of operations and the Company did not consider the amount material to prior periods. 
 F-44 

Consideration  
 The total consideration for the Forest Acquisition of $27.7 billion is comprised of the equity value of shares that were outstanding and vested prior to July 1, 2014 of $20.0 billion, the portion of outstanding equity awards deemed to have been earned as of July 1, 2014 of $568.1 million and cash of $7.1 billion. The portion of outstanding equity awards deemed not to have been earned of $570.4 million as of July 1, 2014 will be expensed over the remaining future vesting period, including $70.7 million, $142.8 million and $287.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
 Inventories 
 The fair value of inventories acquired included an acquisition accounting fair market value step-up of $1,036.3 million. The Company recognized $19.3 million, $224.7 million, and $751.0 million as a component of cost of sales in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as the inventory acquired on July 1, 2014 was sold to the Company s customers in addition to a write-off associated with the Respiratory Sale. These amounts include zero, $0.6 million and $40.6 million related to discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 IPR D and Intangible Assets  
 The estimated fair value of the IPR D and identifiable intangible assets was determined using the IPR D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique. The discount rates used to arrive at the present value at the acquisition date of CMPs was 8.0% and for IPR D ranged from 8.0% to 9.0%, to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty in the cash flow projections. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.  
 The following table identifies the summarized amounts recognized and the weighted average useful lives using the economic benefit of intangible assets ($ in millions):  

F-45 

Goodwill   
 Among the primary reasons the Company acquired Forest and factors that contributed to the preliminary recognition of goodwill were to expand the Company s branded pharmaceuticals product portfolio, and to acquire certain benefits from the Forest pipeline and the expectation of the Company generating certain synergies. The goodwill recognized from the Forest Acquisition, which includes the increase in the purchase price resulting from the movement in Allergan plc s share price from the date of announcing the deal, until the date of acquisition, is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill from the Forest Acquisition was primarily assigned to the US General Medicine segment.  
 Deferred Tax Liabilities, net  
 Deferred tax liabilities, net, include the impact resulting from identifiable intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. These adjustments create excess book basis over the tax basis which is multiplied by the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the deferred taxes exist.  
 Divested Products  
 In order to complete the Forest Acquisition, the Company divested two legacy Actavis products to Impax Laboratories, Inc. ( Impax  Lamotrigine ODT and Ursodiol Tablets for cash consideration. In exchange for the products, the Company received $8.0 million on July 1, 2014, which resulted in a gain on sale of asset of $5.4 million. In addition, the Company and Impax entered into a supply agreement whereby the Company will supply product to Impax. Revenues recognized from the divested products were deminimis in the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, on July 1, 2014, the Company divested two acquired Forest products for a combined consideration of $13.5 million. The product revenues were not included in the results of operations of the Company.  
 Acquisition-Related Expenses 
 As a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company incurred the following transaction and integration costs in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014($ in millions): 

Silom Medical Company 
   On April 1, 2014, the Company acquired Silom Medical Company ( Silom ), a privately held generic pharmaceutical company focused on developing and marketing therapies in Thailand, for consideration of approximately $103.0 million in cash (the  Silom Acquisition ). The Silom Acquisition expanded the Company s position in the Thai generic pharmaceutical market, with leading positions in the ophthalmic and respiratory therapeutic categories and a strong cardiovascular franchise. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.  The assets and liabilities acquired, as well as the results of operations for the acquired Silom business were part  
 F-46 

of the assets divested in the Teva Transaction and are included as a component of income from discontinued operations.  In addition the acquired financial position is included in assets and liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2015.   
 The Silom Acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date as follows ($ in millions):  

Divestitures 
 Corona Facility  
 During the year ended December 31, 2014, we held for sale assets in our Corona, California manufacturing facility. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge as a component of discontinued operations of $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, including a write-off of property, plant and equipment, net, due to the integration of Warner Chilcott of $5.8 million. The Company completed the sale of these assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 with no material impact to the Company s results of operations.

The Company accounted for the contingent consideration in the Allergan Acquisition with an initial acquisition date fair value of $169.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized approximately $210.0 million of impairments due to clinical data not supporting continuation of the R D study offset, in part, by a reduction of contingent liability of $186.0 million recorded in R D. 
 Acquired agreements from the Forest Acquisition 
 Trevena 
   On May 9, 2013, in connection with entering into an agreement with Trevena, Inc. to acquire the option to license one of Trevena, Inc. s products (which option has since lapsed), Forest purchased $30.0 million of Trevena preferred stock in a round of private placement financing.

In conjunction with the IPO, the Company purchased an additional  
 F-47 

$3.0 million of common stock of Trevena. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the Trevena common stock held by the Company was $20.0 million and $35.6 million, respectively and is included as a component of  investments and other assets .  
 Ironwood collaboration agreement 
 In September 2007, Forest entered into a collaboration agreement with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals ( Ironwood ) to jointly develop and commercialize Linzess    (linaclotide) for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company shares equally with Ironwood all profits and losses (as defined) from the development and commercialization of Linzess in the U.S. In addition, the Company expanded this agreement to cover the acquired Constella rights internationally. 
 The agreement included contingent milestone payments as well as a contingent equity investment based on the achievement of specific clinical and commercial milestones. The Company may be obligated to pay up to an additional $100.0 million if certain sales milestones are achieved. 
 Based on the nature of the arrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature of the payments and applicable guidance, the Company records receipts from and payments to Ironwood in two pools: the  Development pool  which consists of R D expenses, and the  Commercialization pool,  which consists of revenue, cost of sales and other operating expenses. The net payment to or receipt from Ironwood for the Development pool is recorded in R D expense and the net payment to or receipt from Ironwood for the Commercialization pool is recorded in cost of goods sold. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the Ironwood shares was $31.9 million and $24.1 million, respectively and is included as a component of  investments and other assets.   
 Amgen Collaboration

The collaboration products are expected to be sold under a joint Amgen/Allergan label. We will initially receive royalties and sales milestones from product revenues. The collaboration will not pursue biosimilars of Amgen s proprietary products.  

NOTE 7   Discontinued Operations  
 Global Generics Business 
 On July 27, 2015, the Company announced that it entered into the Teva Transaction, which closed on August 2, 2016.  Under the Teva Transaction, Teva acquired Allergan's global generics business, including the U.S. and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic R D unit, our international OTC commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and some established international brands.   Allergan retained its global branded pharmaceutical and medical aesthetics businesses, as well as its biosimilars development programs, and certain OTC products. The Company will also have continuing involvement with Teva after the close of the transaction.  As a result of the Teva Transaction, the Company holds equity in Teva and purchases product manufactured by Teva for sale in our US General Medicine segment as part of ongoing transitional service and contract manufacturing agreements. 
 On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business for $500.0 million. Teva acquired our Anda Distribution business, which distributes generic, brand, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from more than 300 manufacturers to retail independent and chain pharmacies, nursing homes, mail order pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and physician offices across the United States.  
 F-48 

The Company notes the following reconciliation of the proceeds received in the sale of the generics business and Anda Distribution business to the gain recognized in income from discontinued operations ($ in millions):   

In October 2016, pursuant to the Teva Transaction, Teva provided its proposed estimated adjustment to the closing date working capital balance to the Company.  The final amount of any agreed contractual adjustment could vary materially from the adjustment calculated by the Company at the time of the closing of the Teva Transaction and any agreed adjustment to the Company s proceeds from the Teva Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and cash flows.  The Company expects the amount of the adjustment will be determined in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Teva Transaction.  As of December 31, 2016, the amount had yet to be settled. 
   
 The Teva Shares are recorded within  Marketable securities  on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The closing Teva transaction date opening stock price discounted at a rate of 5.9 percent due to the lack of marketability was used to initially value the shares.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a $1,599.4 million unrealized loss on the Teva Shares due to a decline in the share price, which was recorded as a component of  Other comprehensive income.  The Company currently considers the decline in value of its investment in Teva securities to be temporary.  We will continue to monitor the value of this investment to determine if the decline in value becomes other than temporary.  
 Financial results of the global generics business and the Anda Distribution business are presented as  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014; and assets and liabilities of the businesses are presented as  Current assets held for sale ,  Non current assets held for sale ,  Current liabilities held for sale  and  Long term liabilities held for sale  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.   
 The following table presents key financial results of the global generics business and the Anda Distribution business included in  Income from discontinued operations  for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 ($ in millions):

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $5,738.8 million related to investments in certain subsidiaries. The recognition of this benefit has been reflected in  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax  with the deferred tax asset reflected in non-current  Deferred tax liabilities  on the December 31, 2015 balance sheet as adjusted for activity in the fourth quarter of 2015.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $462.2 million to adjust its deferred tax asset related to investments in certain subsidiaries. The recognition of this expense has been reflected in  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax.   Upon the closing of the Teva Transaction, the Company recorded the reversal of the corresponding deferred tax asset of $5,276.6 million against the current income taxes payable in continuing operations.  
 The following table presents the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities related to the global generics business and Anda Distribution business which were disposed of during the year ended December 31, 2016 ($ in millions):

NOTE 8   Share-Based Compensation 
 The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. A summary of the Company s share-based compensation plans is presented below. 
 Equity Award Plans 
 The Company has adopted several equity award plans which authorize the granting of options, restricted shares, restricted stock units and other forms of equity awards of the Company s ordinary shares, subject to certain conditions. 
 F-50 

The Company grants awards with the following features:  

Time-based vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units awards;     

Performance-based restricted stock unit awards measured to the EBITDA, as defined, of the Company or other performance-based targets defined by the Company;     

Performance-based restricted stock unit awards based on pre-established total shareholder returns metrics;     

Non-qualified options to purchase outstanding shares; and     

Cash-settled awards recorded as a liability. These cash settled awards are based on pre-established total shareholder returns metrics.     

 Option awards require options to be granted at the fair value of the shares underlying the options at the date of the grant and generally become exercisable over periods ranging from three to five years. Each option granted expires ten years from the date of the grant. Restricted stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to ordinary shares, subject to certain terms. Restricted stock unit awards are grants that entitle the holder the right to receive an ordinary share, subject to certain terms. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards (both time-based vesting and performance-based vesting) generally have restrictions eliminated over a one to four year vesting period. Restrictions generally lapse for non-employee directors after one year. Certain restricted stock units are performance-based awards issued at a target number with the actual number of restricted shares issued ranging based on achievement of the performance criteria. The Company s equity awards include the acquired awards from the Allergan Acquisition and the Kythera Acquisition ( 2015 Acquired Awards ) and the acquired awards from the Forest Acquisition ( 2014 Acquired Awards ).   
 Fair Value Assumptions 
 All restricted stock and restricted stock units (whether time-based vesting or performance-based vesting), are granted and expensed, using the fair value per share on the applicable grant date, over the applicable vesting period. Non-qualified options to purchase ordinary shares are granted to employees at exercise prices per share equal to the closing market price per share on the date of grant. The fair value of non-qualified options is determined on the applicable grant dates using the Black-Scholes method of valuation and that amount is recognized as an expense over the vesting period. Using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the fair value of options is based on the following assumptions:  

Share-Based Compensation Expense 
 Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Company s results of operations, including discontinued operations, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows ($ in millions): 

F-51 

In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, share-based compensation expense included as discontinued operations was $12.9 million, $36.4 million, and $18.8 million, respectively.    
   
 In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the related tax benefits were $131.8 million, $285.9 million and $145.7 million, respectively relating to stock-based compensation.  
 Included in the equity-based compensation awards for the year ended December 31, 2016 is the impact of accelerations and step-ups relating to the acquisition accounting treatment of outstanding awards acquired in the Allergan and Forest Acquisitions of $108.9 million and $45.2 million, respectively.  Included in the year ended December 31, 2015 is the impact of accelerations and step-ups relating to the acquisition accounting treatment of outstanding awards acquired in the Allergan, Kythera and Forest Acquisitions of $314.8 million, $64.4 million and $109.7 million, respectively. Included in the year ended December 31, 2014, was $287.5 million of stock-based compensation inclusive of a $249.1 million step-up relating to the acquisition accounting treatment of outstanding awards acquired in the Forest Acquisition. 
 Unrecognized future stock-based compensation expense was $448.8 million as of December 31, 2016, including $146.9 million from the Allergan Acquisition and $32.3 million from the Forest Acquisition. This amount will be recognized as an expense over a remaining weighted average period of 1.5 years. Stock-based compensation is being amortized and charged to operations over the same period as the restrictions are eliminated for the participants, which is generally on a straight-line basis. 
 Share Activity 
 The following is a summary of equity award activity for unvested restricted stock and stock units in the period from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2016:

NOTE 9   Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans   
 Defined Benefit Plan Obligations 
 The Company has numerous defined benefit plans offered to employees around the world. For these plans, retirement benefits are generally based on an employee s years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances.  As of December 31, 2016, a majority of the Company s plans were frozen for future enrollment. 
 The net periodic benefit cost of the defined benefit plans for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows ($ in millions): 

Obligations and Funded Status 
 Employee benefit plans are an exception to the recognition and fair value measurement principles in business combinations. Employee benefit plan obligations are recognized and measured in accordance with the existing authoritative literature for accounting for benefit plans rather than at fair value. Accordingly, the Company remeasured the benefit plans acquired as part of its acquisitions and recognized an asset or liability for the funded status of these plans as of the respective acquisition dates. 
 Benefit obligation and asset data for the defined benefit plans for continuing operations, were as follows ($ in millions): 

F-53 

The following table outlines the funded actuarial amounts recognized ($ in millions): 

The underfunding of pension benefits is primarily a function of the different funding incentives that exist outside of the United States. In certain countries, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly by the Company as they become due. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 As of December 31, 2015, the following is the plan assets and liabilities included in assets and liabilities held for sale as part of the Teva Transaction ($ in millions): 

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized $2.1 million, $6.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively, as a component of income from discontinued operations related to the Teva Transaction relating to defined benefit plans. 
 Plan Assets 
 Companies are required to use a fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC Topic 820  Fair Value Measurement,  ( ASC 820 ) which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value ( Fair Value Leveling ). There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest: 
 Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 F-54 

Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The Level 3 assets are those whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.  
 If the inputs used to measure the financial assets fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 
 The fair values of the Company s pension plan assets for continuing operations at December 31, 2016 by asset category are as follows ($ in millions): 

The fair values of the Company s pension plan assets for continuing operations at December 31, 2015 by asset category are as follows ($ in millions): 

F-55 

The assets of the pension plan are held in separately administered trusts. The investment guidelines for the Company s pension plans is to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of the plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of the Company s continuing operations pension plans is allocated as follows:  

(1)    
 
 Includes the asset allocation of the Allergan Plans following the Allergan Acquisition on March 17, 2015.    

Expected Contributions 
 Employer contributions to the pension plan during the year ending December 31, 2017 are expected to be $4.9 million for continuing operations. 
 Expected Benefit Payments 
 Total expected benefit payments for the Company s continuing operations pension plans are as follows ($ in millions): 

Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. The majority of the payments will be paid from plan assets and not Company assets. 
   
 Information for continuing operations defined benefit plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets is presented below ($ in millions): 

Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income / (Loss) 
 Net loss / gain amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension cost over the average remaining service life of employees. Balances recognized within accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows ($ in millions): 

F-56 

Actuarial Assumptions  
 The weighted average assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Company s defined benefit plans, including assets and liabilities held for sale, are as follows: 

The weighted average assumptions used to calculate the net periodic benefit cost of the Company s defined benefit plans, including assets and liabilities held for sale, are as follows: 

In order to select a discount rate for purposes of valuing the plan obligations the Company uses market returns and adjusts them as needed to fit the estimated duration of the plan liabilities. 
 The expected rate of return represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, long-term historical returns data are considered as well as actual returns on the plan assets and other capital markets experience. Using this reference information, the long-term return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected return was developed, according to the allocation among those investment categories. 
 Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans 
 As a result of the Allergan and Forest acquisitions, the Company assumed post-retirement benefit plans.  Accumulated benefit obligation and asset data for the defined benefit plans, were as follows ($ in millions): 

Savings Plans 
 The Company also maintains certain defined contribution savings plans covering substantially all U.S.-based employees. The Company contributes to the plans based upon the employee contributions. The Company s contributions to these retirement plans for amounts included in continuing operations were $75.6 million, $26.6 million and $35.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Company s contributions to these retirement plans for amounts included in income from discontinued operations were $23.6 million and $31.0 million in the years ended 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The outstanding principal amount of loans under the AGN Five Year Tranche was payable in equal quarterly amounts of 2.50% per quarter prior to March 17, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on March 17, 2020.   
 Bridge Loan Facility 
 On December 17, 2014, Allergan and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a 364-day senior unsecured bridge credit agreement (the  Bridge Loan Facility ), among Actavis Capital, as borrower, Allergan plc, Warner Chilcott Limited, Allergan Finance, LLC, Actavis Funding SCS, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMCB, as administrative agent and the other financial institutions party thereto. No amounts were borrowed under the Bridge Loan Facility and the commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility expired on March 17, 2015 upon the closing of the Allergan Acquisition. 
 Cash Bridge Loan Facility 
 On March 11, 2015, Allergan and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a 60-day senior unsecured bridge credit agreement (the  Cash Bridge Loan Facility ), among Actavis Capital, as borrower, Allergan plc, Warner Chilcott Limited, Allergan Finance, LLC, Actavis Funding SCS, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the  Cash Bridge Lenders ), JPMCB, as administrative agent and the other financial institutions party thereto. Under the Cash Bridge Loan Facility, the Cash Bridge Lenders committed to provide, subject to certain conditions, unsecured bridge financing, of which $2.8 billion was drawn to finance the Allergan Acquisition on March 17, 2015. The outstanding balance of the Cash Bridge Loan Facility was repaid on April 9, 2015. 
 Borrowings under the Cash Bridge Loan Facility bore interest at our choice of a per annum rate equal to either (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin per annum varying from 0.00% per annum to 1.00% per annum, depending on the Debt Rating or (b) a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin varying from 1.00% per annum to 2.00% per annum, depending on the Debt Rating.

Annual Debt Maturities  
 As of December 31, 2016, annual debt maturities were as follows ($ in millions): 

Amounts represent total anticipated cash payments assuming scheduled repayments. 
 Lease Commitments 
 The Company has operating leases for certain facilities and equipment. The terms of the operating leases for the Company s facility leases require the Company to pay property taxes, normal maintenance expense and maintain minimum insurance coverage. Total rental expense for operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $47.7 million, $49.9 million, and $69.7 million, respectively. The Company also has deminimis capital leases for certain facilities and equipment. The future minimum lease payments under both capital and operating leases that have remaining terms in excess of one year are ($ in millions):  

The Company has entered into certain sub-lease agreements which will offset future lease commitments. 

NOTE 17   Other Long-Term Liabilities 
 Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

F-71 

The Company determines the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration obligations based on a probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations including contingent payments such as milestone obligations, royalty obligations and contract earn-out criteria, where applicable. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The resultant probability-weighted cash flows are discounted using an appropriate effective annual interest rate to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty, major risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of the projects triggering the contingent obligation. At each reporting date, the Company revalues the contingent consideration obligation to estimated fair value and records changes in fair value as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various contingent consideration obligations. Accretion expense related to the increase in the net present value of the contingent liability is included in operating income for the period.   

NOTE 18   Income Taxes 
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, foreign losses before taxes were $1,502.8 million, $4,291.7 million and $2,966.0 million, respectively.  
 The Company s (benefit)/provision for income taxes consisted of the following ($ in millions):  

The exercise of certain equity based awards resulted in a tax benefit that has been reflected as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The benefits recorded were $20.4 million, $76.1 million and $51.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  
   
 F-72 

The reconciliations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 between the statutory Irish and Bermuda income tax rates for Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited, respectively, and the effective income tax rates were as follows:  

(1)    
 
 Earnings subject to U.S. federal and state tax had a larger impact on the effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the period ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in expenses in 2016. These expenses included a full year of amortization expense related to intangibles acquired as part of the Allergan Acquisition and incremental costs associated with the acquisition related financing.    

(2)    
 
 Earnings subject to tax rates different than the statutory rate had a larger impact on the effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the period ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily driven by the inclusion of a full year of Allergan post-acquisition operating income earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Irish statutory rate and changes to the earnings mix resulting from restructuring associated with the sale of the global generics business.     

(3)    
 
 In 2016, the Company recorded $6.5 billion of amortization expense. A significant portion of this amount was incurred in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the statutory rate resulting in a $482.3 million favorable impact on the effective tax rate.    

(4)    
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2016, a tax rate change was enacted in France resulting in a $209.0 million tax benefit.    

(5)    
 
 In 2016, the Company recorded a tax expense of $183.8 million predominately related to a change in the valuation allowance on U.S. capital loss carryforwards resulting from restructuring associated with the sale of the global generics business.    

F-73 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The significant components of the Company s net deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):  

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the Company recorded deferred tax liabilities of approximately $604.9 million and $12,911.5 million related to acquired entities. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company s net deferred tax liability increased by $4,816.5 million primarily due to the reversal of a deferred tax asset of $5,276.6 million, as adjusted for activity during 2016, related to investments in certain U.S. subsidiaries. This was partially offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities of $769.3 million related to investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Refer to  NOTE 7   Discontinued Operations  for further discussion and additional disclosures related to our income tax provision reported as part of discontinued operations. 
   
 The Company had the following carryforward tax attributes at December 31, 2016:  

$954.5 million U.S. federal net operating losses ( NOL ) and other tax attributes which begin to expire in 2019;     

Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $954.5 million and $103.0 million, respectively, are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.  
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company established a valuation allowance of $183.8 million predominately related to a U.S. capital loss carryforward. The tax expense was recorded as a component of income from continuing operations and the balance sheet as part of liabilities held for sale. As of December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance balance of $183.9 million is recorded due to the uncertainty of realizing net operating losses ($75.1 million), tax credits ($103.7 million) and other deferred tax assets ($5.1 million). 
 As of December 31, 2016, deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $7,837.1 million of undistributed earnings of certain non-Irish subsidiaries as these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-Irish operations. The undistributed earnings would be subject to withholding tax and in certain circumstances U.S. income tax of approximately $456.2 million if amounts were distributed to Allergan plc.  
 In making this assertion, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its Irish and non-Irish operations and the need for cash within and outside Ireland, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions and market expansion. 
 F-74 

As of December 31, 2016, the Company has accrued income taxes, including withholding taxes, of $1,396.3 million for certain pre-acquisition earnings primarily related to the Forest and Allergan acquisitions. The amount determined was generally based on the amount of cash and other assets available to be distributed or otherwise repatriated by Forest and Allergan s non-U.S. subsidiaries. It is intended that these cash balances would eventually be remitted to the U.S. (and ultimately to Ireland) effectively to refinance a portion of the debt related to the acquisition of Forest Laboratories, Inc. and Allergan, Inc. by Allergan plc. The Company continues to evaluate its global cash needs but expects to repatriate these earnings as financing related to these acquisitions ultimately become payable.  
   
 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes    
 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):  

If these benefits were subsequently recognized, $757.9 million would favorably impact the Company s effective tax rate. 
 The Company's continuing policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company recognized approximately $2.0 million, $(0.5) million and $5.1 million in interest and penalties, respectively. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company had accrued $65.3 million (net of tax benefit of $35.4 million), $63.3 million (net of tax benefit of $34.2 million) and $65.6 million (net of tax benefit of $25.3 million) of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, respectively. Although the company cannot determine the impact with certainty based on specific factors, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may change by up to approximately $150.0 million within the next twelve months due to the resolution of certain tax examinations. 
 The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, it files U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are in accordance with the accounting standard, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations with tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.  
   
 Due to our numerous acquisitions, the Company has several concurrent audits still pending with the IRS as set forth below:

NOTE 19   Stockholders  Equity     
 Share Repurchases  
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase program which was completed in October 2016.  Additionally, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved a $10.0 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was initiated in November 2016. Under the accelerated share repurchase program, the Company received $8.0 billion of repurchased shares during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased a total of 61.6 million shares of ordinary shares under the Share Repurchase Programs.  The amount of shares, if any, to be received from the remaining $2.0 billion of repurchases is subject to the volume weighted average share price over the term of the agreement.  Additionally, a portion of the accelerated share repurchase program is subject to a collar which would set the cap and floor of the share price for the transaction. 
 Quarterly Dividend 
 On November 2, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a regular quarterly cash dividend for holders of the Company s ordinary shares.  In February 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share with the first payment on March 28, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2017. 
   
 Preferred Shares 
 On February 24, 2015, the Company completed an offering of 5,060,000 of our 5.500% mandatorily convertible preferred shares, Series A, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares ). Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our board of directors, or an authorized committee thereof, at an annual rate of 5.500% on the liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per Mandatory Convertible Preferred Share. The Company may pay declared dividends in cash, by delivery of our ordinary shares or by delivery of any combination of cash and our ordinary shares, as determined by us in our sole discretion, subject to certain limitations, on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year commencing June 1, 2015, to and including March 1, 2018. The net proceeds from the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Share issuance of $4,929.7 million were used to fund the Allergan Acquisition. 
 Each Mandatory Convertible Preferred Share will automatically convert on March 1, 2018, into between 2.8345 and 3.4722 ordinary shares, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, including adjustments related to our new quarterly dividend. The number of our ordinary shares issuable on conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares will be determined based on the volume weighted average price per ordinary share over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on and including the 22nd scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 1, 2018, the mandatory conversion date. At any time prior to March 1, 2018, other than during a fundamental change conversion period as defined, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares may elect to convert each Mandatory Convertible Preferred Share into our ordinary shares at the minimum conversion rate of 2.8345 ordinary shares per Mandatory Convertible Preferred Share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, holders may elect to convert any Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares during a specified period beginning on the fundamental change effective date, in which case such Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares will be converted into our ordinary shares at the fundamental change conversion rate and converting holders will also be entitled to receive a fundamental change dividend make-whole amount and accumulated dividend amount. 
 In the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $278.4 million and $208.1 million of dividends on preferred shares, respectively.  
 2015 Ordinary Shares Offering 
 On March 2, 2015, in connection with the Allergan Acquisition, the Company issued 14,513,889 of its ordinary shares for an actual public offering price of $288.00 per share. The net proceeds of $4,071.1 million were used, in part, to finance the Allergan Acquisition. 
 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income / (Loss)  
 For most of the Company s international operations, the local currency has been determined to be the functional currency. The results of its non-U.S. dollar based operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Equity is translated at the prevailing rate of exchange at the date of the equity transaction. Translation adjustments are reflected in shareholders  equity and are included as a component of other comprehensive income / (loss). The effects of converting non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded as transaction gains/losses in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
 F-76 

Unrealized gain / (losses) net of tax primarily represent experience differentials and other actuarial charges related to the Company s defined benefit plans.   The movements in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) for the years ended December, 2016 and 2015 were as follows ($ in millions):   

NOTE 20   Segments 
 During 2016, Allergan announced a realignment of its businesses to streamline operations. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as four distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International and Anda Distribution. Under the new organizational structure being reported, and the result of our decision to sell our Anda Distribution business, the Company organized its businesses into the following segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs, and the results of corporate initiatives, are managed outside of the three segments.  Prior period results have been recast to align to the current segment presentation. 
 The operating segments are organized as follows: 

The US Specialized Therapeutics segment includes sales and expenses relating to certain branded products within the US, including Medical Aesthetics, Medical Dermatology, Eye Care, Neurosciences and Urology therapeutic products.     

The US General Medicine segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US that do not fall into the US Specialized Therapeutics business units, including Central Nervous System, Gastrointestinal, Women s Health, Anti-Infectives and Diversified Brands.     

The International segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside the US.     

 The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for our segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (defined below), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. Included in segment revenues are product sales that were sold through our former Anda Distribution business once the Anda Distribution business had sold the product to a third party customer. These sales are included in segment results and are reclassified into revenues from discontinued operations through a reduction of Corporate revenues which eliminates the sales made by our Anda Distribution business from results of continuing operations prior to October 3, 2016.  Cost of sales for these products in discontinued operations is equal to our average third party cost of sales for third party branded products distributed by Anda Distribution. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level: 

Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales, selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs.     

General and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including certain expenses located within the United States.     

 F-77 

Total assets including capital expenditures.     

Other select revenues and operating expenses including R D expenses, amortization, IPR D impairments and asset sales and impairments, net, as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments.       

 The Company defines segment net revenues as product sales and other revenue derived from branded products or licensing agreements. In March 2015, as a result of the Allergan Acquisition, we began to promote Restasis   , Lumigan   /Ganfort   , Alphagan   /Combigan   , Botox   , Fillers, other aesthetic products and other eye care products.  In July 2014, as a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company also began recognizing revenues on key US brands, including, but not limited to, Bystolic    , Canasa   , Carafate   , Fetzima    , Linzess    , Namenda   IR (which lost exclusivity in July 2015), Namenda XR   , Saphris   , Teflaro    and Viibryd   . 
 Cost of sales within segment contribution includes standard production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements and finished goods inventory reserve charges.  Cost of sales included within segment contribution does not include non-standard production costs, such as non-finished goods inventory obsolescence charges, manufacturing variances and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles. 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.  
 General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.  
 Segment net revenues, segment operating expenses and segment contribution information consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 ($ in millions):

During 2015, activity related to our business restructuring and facility rationalization activities primarily related to the cost optimization initiatives in conjunction with the Allergan and Forest acquisitions. Restructuring activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows ($ in millions): 

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized restructuring charges related to continuing operations of $106.1 million, $817.6 million and $330.9 million, respectively. 

NOTE 22   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 The Company s revenue, earnings, cash flows and fair value of its assets and liabilities can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange risks and interest rates, as applicable. The Company manages the impact of foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency derivatives. 
 Foreign Currency Derivatives 
 Overall, the Company is a net recipient of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company s consolidated revenues and favorably impact operating expenses in U.S. dollars. 
   Primarily as a result of the Allergan Acquisition and from time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency derivatives to reduce current and future earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to  
 F-83 

focus its attention on its core business issues. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses. The Company enters into foreign currency derivatives in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures. The Company does not designate the current derivative instruments as accounting hedges.  
 The Company uses foreign currency derivatives, which provide for the sale or purchase or the option for sale or purchase of foreign currencies to economically hedge the currency exchange risks associated with probable but not firmly committed transactions that arise in the normal course of the Company s business. Probable but not firmly committed transactions are comprised primarily of sales of products and purchases of raw material in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The foreign currency derivatives are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. While these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures. 
 The Company recognized realized and unrealized (gains) on such contracts of $(4.0) million, $(1.4) million and $(2.3) million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.  
 The fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives are recorded in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets,   investments and other assets  or  Accounts payable and accrued expenses.  At December 31, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency derivative assets associated with the foreign exchange option contracts of $0.1 million and $25.0 million, respectively, were included in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets.  At December 31, 2015, foreign currency derivative assets associated with the foreign exchange option contracts of $48.5 million were included in  investments and other assets.  At December 31, 2016, there were no foreign currency derivative liabilities associated with the foreign exchange option contracts. At December 31, 2015, there was $0.3 million in foreign currency derivative liabilities associated with the foreign exchange forward contracts were included in  Accounts payable and accrued expenses.   

NOTE 23   Fair Value Measurement 
 Assets and liabilities are measured at fair value using Fair Value Leveling or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following ($ in millions):  

*    
 
    Marketable securities with less than 90 days remaining until maturity are classified as cash equivalents.     

 F-84 

Marketable securities and investments consist of available-for-sale investments in U.S. treasury and agency securities and publicly traded equity securities for which market prices are readily available. Unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities and investments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) / income.  Realized gains or losses on marketable securities and investments are recorded in interest income.  The Company s marketable securities and other long-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices using the specific identification method. These investments are classified as either current or non-current, as appropriate, in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and maturity management.  
 Foreign Currency Contracts 
 At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional principal and fair value of the Company s outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments were as follows ($ in millions, except average contract rate or strike amount): 

The notional principal amounts provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and do not represent the amount of the Company s exposure to market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 
 F-85 

Contingent Consideration Obligations  
 The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration obligations is determined using Level 3 inputs and is based on a probability-weighted income approach. The measurement is based upon unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity based on our own assumptions. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, including accretion, are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as follows ($ in millions):  

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had net contingent consideration income of $64.2 million primarily driven by ongoing R D projects that were terminated based on clinical data acquired in the Allergan Acquisition, which was offset by   additional contingent consideration expense relating to milestones achieved in connection with the   AqueSys   and Allergan Acquisitions. 
   
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded additional contingent consideration of $29.8 million in connection with the approval of Viberzi , $81.4 million in connection with the approval of Liletta    and $6.4 million in connection with the approval of Dalvance   .  Offsetting these amounts were gains from fair value of adjustments related to the Forest Acquisition of $32.3 million and the Allergan Acquisition of $8.2 million. 
   
 The table below provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions): 

F-86 

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the following activity in contingent consideration obligations by acquisition was incurred ($ in millions):   

NOTE 24   Commitments and Contingencies 
 The Company and its affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquires, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The Company s general practice is to expense legal fees as services are rendered in connection with legal matters, and to accrue for liabilities when losses are probable and reasonably estimable. 
 The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued. As of December 31, 2016, the Company s consolidated balance sheet includes accrued loss contingencies of approximately $70.0 million. 
 The Company s legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to mass tort actions and class actions with thousands of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as other matters, involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to,  qui tam  actions, antitrust, product liability, breach of contract, securities, patent infringement and trade practices), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process (which in complex proceedings of the sort faced by us often extend for several years). As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss. In those proceedings in which plaintiffs do request publicly quantified amounts of relief, the Company does not believe that the quantified amounts are meaningful because they are merely stated jurisdictional limits, exaggerated and/or unsupported by the evidence or applicable burdens of proof. 
 In matters involving the defense of the Company s intellectual property, the Company believes it has meritorious claims and intends to vigorously defend the patents or other intellectual property at issue in such litigation.  Similarly, in matters where the Company is a defendant, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously.  However, the Company can offer no assurances that it will be successful in a litigation or, in the case of patent enforcement matters, that a generic version of the product at issue will not be launched or enjoined.  Failing to prevail in a litigation could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Antitrust Litigation 
   Asacol      Litigation.  Two class action complaints were filed on June 22, 2015, and three more on September 21, 2015, in federal court in Massachusetts on behalf of a putative class of indirect purchasers. In each complaint plaintiffs allege that they paid higher prices for Warner Chilcott s Asacol    HD and Delzicol    products as a result of Warner Chilcott s alleged actions preventing or delaying generic competition in the market for Warner Chilcott s older Asacol    product in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws and/or state laws. Plaintiffs seek unspecified injunctive relief, treble damages and/or attorneys  fees. Defendants moved to dismiss the indirect purchasers  complaint. A hearing was held on the motion to dismiss on May 11, 2016.  On July 20, 2016, the court issued a decision granting the motion in part, dismissing the indirect purchaser plaintiffs  claims based on purported reverse payments and   
 F-87 

dismissing several of indirect purchaser plaintiffs  claims based on state laws. On August 15, 2016, the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.  The Company filed an answer to the second amended complaint on October 4, 2016.  Complaints were also filed on behalf of a putative class of direct purchasers of Asacol        in federal court in New York on April 26, 2016, and on June 29, 2016, in each case making similar allegations to the complaints filed by the indirect purchaser plaintiffs.  Those matters have been consolidated with the indirect purchaser cases in the federal court in Massachusetts.   On October 11, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the direct purchasers  consolidated complaint and oral argument on the motion was held on December 16, 2016.    
 Botox      Litigation .

 Doryx      Litigation . In July 2012, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Mylan ) filed a complaint against Warner Chilcott and Mayne Pharma International Pty. Ltd. ( Mayne ) in federal court in Pennsylvania alleging that Warner Chilcott and Mayne prevented or delayed Mylan s generic competition to Warner Chilcott s Doryx    products in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with Mylan s prospective economic relationships under Pennsylvania state law. In the complaint, Mylan seeks unspecified treble and punitive damages and attorneys  fees. Warner Chilcott and Mylan filed motions for summary judgment on March 10, 2014. On April 16, 2015, the court issued an order granting Warner Chilcott and Mayne s motion for summary judgment, denying Mylan s summary judgment motion and entering judgment in favor of Warner Chilcott and Mayne on all counts. Mylan appealed the district court s decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  On September 28, 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision and affirmed the ruling of the district court.  On November 30, 2016 the Third Circuit Court of Appeals denied Mylan s petition for a rehearing  en banc .  
             Loestrin      24 Litigation.    On April 5, 2013, two putative class actions were filed in the federal district court against Warner Chilcott   and certain affiliates alleging that Warner Chilcott   s 2009 patent lawsuit settlements   with Watson Laboratories and Lupin related to Loestrin      24 Fe were   unlawful. The complaints, both asserted on behalf of putative classes of end-payors, generally allege that Watson and Lupin improperly delayed launching generic versions of Loestrin    24 in exchange for substantial payments from Warner Chilcott in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. The complaints each seek declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. Additional complaints have been filed by different plaintiffs seeking to represent the same putative class of end-payors. In addition to the end-payor suits, two lawsuits have been filed on behalf of a class of direct payors and by direct purchasers in their individual capacities.  After a hearing on September 26, 2013, the JPML issued an order transferring all related Loestrin    24 cases to the federal court for the District of Rhode Island. On September 4, 2014, the court granted the defendants  motion to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs appealed the district court s decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and oral argument was held on December 7, 2015. On February 22, 2016 the First Circuit issued its decision vacating the decision of, and remanding the matter to, the district court.  On June 11, 2016, defendants filed an omnibus motion to dismiss the claims of the direct purchaser class plaintiffs, end-payor class plaintiffs and individual direct purchaser plaintiffs.  Oral argument on the motion to dismiss was held on January 13, 2017.    
 Namenda      Litigation . On September 15, 2014, the State of New York, through the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Forest was acting to prevent or delay generic competition to Forest s immediate-release product Namenda    in violation of federal and New York antitrust laws and committed other fraudulent acts in connection with its commercial plans for Namenda    XR. On December 11, 2014, the district court issued a ruling granting the state s preliminary injunction motion and issued an injunction on December 15, 2014 which the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on May 22, 2015. Forest and the New York Attorney General reached a settlement on November 24, 2015. On May 29, 2015, a putative class action was filed on behalf of a class of direct purchasers and on June 8, 2015 a similar putative class action was filed on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers. Since that time, additional complaints have been filed on behalf of putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers. The class action complaints make claims similar to those asserted by the New York Attorney General and also include claims that Namenda    patent litigation settlements between Forest and generic companies also violated the antitrust laws. On December 22, 2015, Forest and its co-defendants filed motions to dismiss the pending complaints. On September 13, 2016, the court issued a decision denying the Company s motion to dismiss.  On September 27, 2016 the Company filed an answer to the amended complaint.   
   Zymar   /Zymaxid    Litigation . On February 16, 2012, Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. filed a complaint in the federal district court in Delaware against Senju Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. ( Senju ), Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ( Kyorin ), and Allergan, Inc.  alleging monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, conspiracy to monopolize, and unreasonable restraint of trade in the market for gatifloxacin ophthalmic formulations, which includes Allergan Inc. s ZYMAR    gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.3%   
 F-88 

and ZYMAXID        gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% products. In the complaint, Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of treble damages and disgorgement of profits.Following the court s denial of Allergan Inc. s motions to dismiss, Allergan Inc. filed an answer to Apotex s complaint on June 1, 2015.   
 On June 6, 2014, a separate antitrust class action complaint was filed in the federal district court in Delaware against the same defendants as in the Apotex case. The complaint alleges that defendants unlawfully excluded or delayed generic competition in the gatifloxacin ophthalmic formulations market (generic versions of ZYMAR    and ZYMAXID   ). On September 18, 2014, Allergan Inc. filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and joined in co-defendants  motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On August 19, 2015, the court granted Allergan Inc. s motion to dismiss. On September 18, 2015, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit oral argument was held on June 13, 2016.  On September 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the District Court s granting of Allergan Inc. s motion to dismiss and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.  The Third Circuit denied the Company s petition for a rehearing on October 4, 2016.   
 Commercial Litigation 
 Celexa     /Lexapro      Class Actions . Forest and certain of its affiliates have been named as defendants in multiple federal court actions relating to the promotion of Celexa    and/or Lexapro     all of which have been consolidated in the Celexa   /Lexapro    MDL proceeding in the federal district court in Massachusetts. On November 13, 2013, an action was filed in federal court in Minnesota which sought to certify a nationwide class of third-party payor entities that purchased Celexa    and Lexapro    for pediatric use. The complaint asserts claims under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act, alleging that Forest engaged in an off-label marketing scheme and paid illegal kickbacks to physicians to induce prescriptions of Celexa    and Lexapro   . Forest moved to dismiss the complaint and on December 12, 2014, and the court thereafter issued a ruling dismissing plaintiff s claims under Minnesota s Deceptive Trade Practices Act, but denying the remaining portions of the motion. A motion for class certification was filed in February, 2016, and denied on June 2, 2016.  Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a 23(f) petition requesting leave to appeal the denial of class certification which the First Circuit denied on December 7, 2016.  On August 28, 2014, an action was filed in the federal district court in Washington seeking to certify a nationwide class of consumers and subclasses of Washington and Massachusetts consumers that purchased Celexa    and Lexapro    for pediatric use. The complaint asserts claims under the federal RICO statute, alleging that Forest engaged in off-label marketing scheme and paid illegal kickbacks to physicians to induce prescriptions of Celexa    and Lexapro   . Forest s moved to dismiss the complaint on December 19, 2014. On June 16, 2015, the court issued a ruling on the motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part. Plaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint. Forest moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  On June 9, 2016, the court denied Forest s motion.  
 Telephone Consumer Protection Act Litigation.   In October 2012, Forest and certain of its affiliates were named as defendants, in a putative class action in federal court in Missouri. This suit alleges that Forest and another defendant violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the  TCPA ) and was filed on behalf of a proposed class that includes all persons who, from four years prior to the filing of the action, were sent telephone facsimile messages of material advertising the commercial availability of any property, goods, or services by or on behalf of defendants, which did not display an opt-out notice compliant with a certain regulation promulgated by the FCC. On July 17, 2013, the district court granted Forest s motion to stay the action pending the administrative proceeding initiated by the pending FCC Petition and a separate petition Forest filed. On October 31, 2015, another class action complaint was filed in Missouri state court against Allergan USA, Inc., Warner Chilcott Corporation and Actavis, Inc., now known as Allergan Finance LLC, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Missouri Consumer Fraud and Protection Act and conversion on behalf of a putative nationwide class of plaintiffs to who defendant Warner Chilcott Corporation sent unsolicited facsimile advertisements. Defendants removed this action to the federal district court for the Western District of Missouri on December 10, 2015 and responded to the complaint on February 8, 2016. On February 17, 2016, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed defendants Allergan USA, Inc. and Actavis, Inc. from the litigation.  
 In a related matter, on June 27, 2013, Forest filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the FCC requesting that the FCC find that (1) the faxes at issue in the action complied, or substantially complied with the FCC regulation, and thus did not violate it, or (2) the FCC regulation was not properly promulgated under the TCPA. Warner Chilcott filed a similar petition with the FCC.  On January 31, 2014, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on Forest s and several other similar petitions. On October 30, 2014, the FCC issued a final order on the FCC Petition granting Forest and several other petitioners a retroactive waiver of the opt-out notice requirement for all faxes sent with express consent. The litigation plaintiffs, who had filed comments on the January 2014 Public Notice, have appealed the final order to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Forest and other petitioners have moved to intervene in the appeal seeking review of that portion of the FCC final order addressing the statutory basis for the opt out/express consent portion of the regulation.  Oral argument before the appellate court took place on November 8, 2016.    
   Prescription Drug Abuse Litigation . The Company has been named as a defendant in three matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers and additional suits may be filed.  On May 21, 2014, the California counties Santa Clara and   
 F-89 

Orange filed a lawsuit in California state court on behalf of the State of California against several pharmaceutical manufacturers. Plaintiffs named Actavis plc in the suit. The California plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 9, 2014. On June 2, 2014, the City of Chicago also filed a complaint in Illinois state court against the same set of defendants, including Actavis plc, that were sued in the California Action. Co-defendants in the action removed the matter to the federal court in Illinois. Both the California and Chicago complaints allege that the manufacturer defendants engaged in a deceptive campaign to promote their products in violation of state and local laws. Each of the complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, penalties and injunctive relief. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in each action. On May 8, 2015, the court in the Chicago litigation granted the Company s motion to dismiss the complaint. On August 26, 2015, the City of Chicago filed a second amended complaint. On September 29, 2016, the court in the Chicago litigation granted in part and denied in part defendants  motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.  On October 25, 2016, Chicago filed a third amended complaint.  On December 15, 2016, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint and filed an answer to the complaint.  In the California action, on August 27, 2015, the court stayed the action based on primary jurisdiction arguments raised in the motions to dismiss. On June 3, 2016, the California plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay and a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.  On July 1, 2016, the Company and co-defendants filed joint oppositions to the California plaintiffs  motion to lift the stay and motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.  On July 27, 2016, the court ordered the California plaintiffs to file another motion for leave to file an amended complaint along with a proposed amended complaint.  On October 19, 2016, the court in the California litigation lifted the stay in part permitting defendants to challenge the third amended complaint and for the parties to discuss settlement and maintaining the stay in all other respects.  On December 15, 2015, the State of Mississippi filed a lawsuit in Mississippi state court against several pharmaceutical manufacturers.  The Mississippi action parallels the allegations in the California and Chicago matters and seeks monetary and equitable relief.  In March and April 2016, the defendants filed motions to dismiss, stay, and transfer venue in the Mississippi action.    
 Testosterone Replacement Therapy Class Action . On November 24, 2014, the Company was served with a putative class action complaint filed on behalf a class of third party payers in federal court in Illinois. The suit alleges that the Company and other named pharmaceutical defendants violated various laws including the federal RICO statute and state consumer protection laws in connection with the sale and marketing of certain testosterone replacement therapy pharmaceutical products ( TRT Products ), including the Company s Androderm    product. This matter was filed in the TRT Products Liability MDL, described in more detail below, notwithstanding that it is not a product liability matter. Plaintiff alleges that it reimbursed third parties for dispensing TRT Products to beneficiaries of its insurance policies. Plaintiff seeks to obtain certain equitable relief, including injunctive relief and an order requiring restitution and/or disgorgement, and to recover damages and multiple damages in an unspecified amount. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the complaint, after which plaintiff amended its complaint. Defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part on February 3, 2016. The Court dismissed plaintiff s substantive RICO claims against the Company for mail and wire fraud for failure to plead with particularity under Rule 9(b) but granted plaintiffs leave to replead. The court also dismissed plaintiff s state law statutory claims and common law claims for fraud and unjust enrichment. The Court declined to dismiss plaintiff s conspiracy claims pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   1962(d) and its claims for negligent misrepresentation. Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint on April 7, 2016.  Defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint on May 5, 2016.  On August 2, 2016, the court dismissed all claims in the Third Amended Complaint against the Company except plaintiffs  RICO conspiracy claim.  On August 29, 2016, the Company filed a Motion for Reconsideration or, in the Alternative, Motion to Certify for Interlocutory Appeal, which the court denied on the September 8, 2016.  Discovery is in the early stages.    
 TNS Products Litigation . On March 19, 2014, a class action complaint was filed in the federal district court in California on behalf of a putative class of consumers.

On May 27, 2015, the case was stayed pending the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in another matter involving similar legal issues.   
   Xaleron Dispute.    On February 5, 2016, Xaleron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Allergan, Inc. and Actavis, Inc., now known as Allergan Finance, LLC in state court in New York. The complaint, filed on February 26, 2016, alleges the defendants misappropriated Xaleron s confidential business information and asserts claims for unfair competition, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and unjust enrichment. The company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on April 15, 2016.  On September 13, 2016 the court issued a decision denying the Company s motion.  Defendants filed an answer to the complaint and the parties are now engaged in discovery.    
 Employment Litigation 
   In July 2012, Forest was named as defendants in an action brought by certain former company sales representatives and specialty sales representatives in the federal district court in New York. The action is a putative class and collective action, and alleges  
 F-90 

class claims under Title VII for gender discrimination with respect to pay and promotions, as well as discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, and a collective action claim under the Equal Pay Act. The proposed Title VII gender class includes all current and former female sales representatives employed by the Company throughout the U.S. from 2008 to the date of judgment, and the proposed Title VII pregnancy sub-class includes all current and former female sales representatives who have been, are, or will become pregnant while employed by the Company throughout the U.S. from 2008 to the date of judgment. The proposed Equal Pay Act collective action class includes current, former, and future female sales representatives who were not compensated equally to similarly-situated male employees during the applicable liability period. The Second Amended Complaint also includes non-class claims on behalf of certain of the named Plaintiffs for sexual harassment and retaliation under Title VII, and for violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act. On August 14, 2014, the court issued a decision on the Company s motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part, striking the plaintiffs  proposed class definition and instead limiting the proposed class to a smaller set of potential class members and dismissing certain of the individual plaintiffs  claims. Plaintiffs filed a motion for conditional certification of an Equal Pay Act collective action on May 22, 2015 which the Company has opposed. On September 2, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs motion to conditionally certify a collective action.   
 Patent Litigation 
 Patent Enforcement Matters 
 Amrix    . In August 2014, Aptalis Pharmatech, Inc.

(collectively  Apotex ). Apotex has notified Aptalis that it has filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market a generic version of Amrix before these patents expire. (The  199 and  121 patents expire in November 2023.) This lawsuit triggered an automatic stay of approval of Apotex s ANDA until no earlier than December 27, 2016 (unless there is a final court decision adverse to Plaintiffs sooner, and subject to any other exclusivities, such as a first filer 180 day market exclusivity). A bench trial concluded on November 17, 2015. Post-trial briefing concluded on April 8, 2016. On December 8, 2016, the court entered an order, opinion and judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Apotex, that Apotex infringes the asserted claims of the  199 and  121 patents.

 Canasa    . In July 2013, Aptalis Pharma US, Inc. and Aptalis Pharma Canada Inc. brought actions for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,217,083 (the   083 patent ) and 8,436,051 (the   051 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Mylan and Sandoz. These companies have notified Aptalis that they have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Canasa    before these patents expire. Amended complaints were filed against these companies in November 2013 adding claims for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,854,384 (the   384 patent ). The  083,  051, and  384 patents expire in June 2028. On November 11, 2015, Aptalis entered into a settlement agreement with Mylan. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mylan may launch its generic version of Canasa      on December 15, 2018, or earlier under certain circumstances. On March 22, 2016, Aptalis entered into a settlement agreement with Sandoz.   
 On December 14, 2015, Aptalis brought an action for infringement of the  083,  051, and  384 patents in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Pharmaceutical Sourcing Partners, Inc. ( PSP ). PSP had notified Aptalis that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Canasa    before certain of these patents expire. This lawsuit triggered an automatic stay of approval of PSP s ANDA that expires no earlier than May 2018 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Aptalis sooner). On December 23 and 27, 2015, Aptalis brought actions for infringement of the  083,  051, and  384 patents in the U.S. District Courts for the District of New Jersey and the District of Delaware, respectively, against Delcor Asset Corp., Renaissance Pharma, Inc. and Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, LLC (collectively,  Delcor ).

On March 14, 2016, Aptalis filed a motion to dismiss PSP s Seventh and Eighth counterclaims alleging unfair competition and tortious interference under state law, or in the alternative, to bifurcate the trial and stay discovery relating to PSP s Seventh and Eighth counterclaims. Trial is scheduled for November 2017 in the PSP action. On April 8, 2016, Aptalis entered into a settlement agreement with Delcor.

 F-91 

(collectively  Zydus ).

 Combigan      II-III . In 2012, Allergan filed a complaint against Sandoz, Alcon, Apotex and Watson in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division, alleging that their proposed products infringe U.S. Patent Number 8,133,890 (the  890 Patent ), and subsequently amended their complaint to assert infringement of U.S. Patent Number 8,354,409. In March 2013, Allergan received a Paragraph IV invalidity and non-infringement certification from Sandoz, contending that the  890 Patent is invalid and not infringed by the proposed generic product. In October 2013, Allergan filed a motion to stay and administratively close the Combigan II matter, which was granted. In April 2015, Allergan filed a stipulation of dismissal and the U.S. District Court granted the Order with respect to the Watson defendants. In October 2015, the U.S. District Court entered an order consolidating the  Combigan      III  matter  C.A. 2:15-cv-00347-JRG  into this matter  C.A. 2:12-cv-00207-JRG , as lead case. A Markman Hearing was held on March 2, 2016.   
 On May 19, 2016, Sandoz filed an opposed motion for leave to amend its answer and counterclaim seeking to add a count for declaratory judgment of invalidity of the  149 Patent. On July 20, 2016, Alcon and Sandoz filed motions for summary judgment of invalidity and non-infringement of claim 4 of the  149 Patent, and Allergan filed a motion for summary judgment of infringement of claim 4 of the  149 Patent and to preclude Sandoz from re-challenging the validity of that claim. On September 30, 2016, the court denied the parties  motions for summary judgment.  A bench trial concluded on October 27, 2016.

In their supplemental briefs, Teva acknowledged that, under the  Acorda  decision, it is subject to specific personal jurisdiction in the Eastern District of Texas and that venue is proper, and Mylan requested that the District Court refrain from taking action on its pending motion until after Mylan has sought panel and  en banc  rehearing in the  Acorda  action. In April 2016, the court issued a memorandum and opinion denying Mylan s and Teva s motions to dismiss. On April 12, 2016, Allergan filed a complaint for infringement of the  111 patent,  162 patent,  556 patent,  048 patent,  930 patent, and the  191 patent in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Famy Care. In March and April 2016, Allergan filed answers to Teva, Akorn and InnoPharma s counterclaims. On June 6, 2016, Famy Care filed an answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims. In June 2016, Allergan filed a motion for consolidation and the court entered an order consolidating the Famy Care matter,  C.A. 2:16-cv-00401-WCB , into  C.A. 2:15-cv-01455-WCB,  (the  Lead  case). 
 On July 20, 2016, Allergan filed a complaint for infringement of the  111 patent,  162 patent,  556 patent,  048 patent,  930 patent, and the  191 patent in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and, on July 21, 2016, a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and TWi Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ( TWi ). TWi notified Allergan that it has filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Restasis    before these certain patents expire.

On December 22, 2016, Allergan filed a complaint for infringement of the  111 patent,  162 patent,  556 patent,  048 patent,  930 patent, and the  191 patent in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Deva Holding A.S. ( Deva ). Deva notified Allergan that it has filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Restasis    before these certain patents expire.  
 Restasis    IPR.  On June 6, 2016, Allergan, Inc. received notification letters that Inter Partes Review of the USPTO ( IPR ) petitions were filed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Mylan ) regarding U.S. Patent Nos. 8,629,111 (the   111 patent ), 8,633,162 (the   162 patent ), 8,642,556 (the   556 patent ), 8,648,048 (the   048 patent ), 8,685,930 (the   930 patent ), and 9,248,191 (the   191 patent ), which patents expire on August 27, 2024. Mylan filed the IPR petition on June 3, 2016. On June 23, 2016, Allergan received a notification letter that a IPR petition and motion for joinder was filed by Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC ( Argentum ) regarding the  111 patent.  On December 7, 2016, Allergan entered into a settlement agreement with Argentum and Argentum s petition was withdrawn.  On December 8, 2016, the USPTO granted Mylan s petitions to institute IPRs with respect to these patents. A hearing is expected on August 17, 2017. On January 6, 2017 each of Akorn, Famy Care and Teva filed, and on January 9, 2017 the USPTO received, IPR petitions with respect to these patents and motions for joinder with the Mylan IPR. On February 6, 2017, Allergan opposed joinder.   
   Saphris    . Between September 2014 and May 2015, Forest Laboratories, LLC, and Forest Laboratories Holdings Ltd. (collectively,  Forest ) brought actions for infringement of some or all of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,763,476 (the   476 patent ), 7,741,358 (the   358 patent ) and 8,022,228 (the   228 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Sigmapharm Laboratories, LLC, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc., Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. and Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and related subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. Including a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity, the  476 patent expires in December 2020, and the  358 and  228 patents expire in October 2026. These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs that expires no earlier than February 13, 2017 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest sooner). On February 3, 2015, the District Court consolidated the then-pending actions for all purposes. On September 30, 2015, the District Court consolidated all pending actions. On March 28, 2016, the court entered Forest and Hikma s proposed joint stipulation and order of adverse judgment and dismissal of claims related to the  358 and  228 patents. In April 2016, the court granted the proposed consent judgment of non-infringement and order of dismissal of counterclaims related to the  358 and  228 patents, as well as a stipulation and order with respect to infringement of Claims 1, 2, and 6 of the  476 patent, between Plaintiffs and Breckenridge. The Court also granted the proposed stipulation of entry and proposed order of adverse judgment and dismissal of counterclaims related to the  358 and  228 patents between Plaintiffs and Sigmapharm. Trial is scheduled to begin in October 2016 with respect to the  476 patent, the only remaining patent-in-suit. In April, May and July 2016, the court granted the proposed   
 F-96 

stipulations and orders of infringement of certain claims of the  476 patent as to Hikma, Breckenridge and Alembic. On October 13, 2016, the court stayed trial as to Sigmapharm and extended the 30-month stay as to Sigmapharm.  Trial concluded on November 3, 2016.  The parties filed their opening post-trial briefs on January 23, 2017.   
 Savella    . Between September 2013 and February 2014, Forest Laboratories, Inc., Forest Laboratories Holdings Ltd. (collectively,  Forest ) and Royalty Pharma Collection Trust ( Royalty ), Forest s licensor for Savella   , brought actions for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,602,911 (the   911 patent ), 7,888,342 (the   342 patent ), and 7,994,220 (the   220 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Amneal, Apotex, First Time US Generics, Glenmark, Hetero, Lupin, Mylan, Par, Ranbaxy, and Sandoz, and related subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. These companies have notified Forest and Royalty that they have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Savella before these patents expire. (The  342 patent expires in November 2021, the  911 patent expires in January 2023, and the  220 patent expires in September 2029.) These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs until July 14, 2016 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest and Royalty Pharma sooner). On March 7, 2014, Forest and Royalty voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, all claims against Sandoz. On March 20, 2014, the district court consolidated all of the remaining pending actions for all purposes and issued a scheduling order setting a trial date in January 2016. On May 12, 2014, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with First Time US Generics. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, and subject to review of the settlement terms by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Forest will provide a license to First Time that will permit it to launch its generic version of Savella    as of the date that is the later of (a) six (6) -calendar months prior to the expiration date of the last to expire of the  911 patent, the  342 patent, and the  220 patent, including any extensions and/or pediatric exclusivities; or (b) the date that First Time obtains final FDA approval of its ANDA, or earlier in certain circumstances. On December 15, 2014, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Ranbaxy. On April 8, 2015, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. On or about April 29, 2015, Forest entered into a settlement agreement with Par that will permit Par to launch its generic version of Savella    as of the date that is the later of (a) six (6) calendar months prior to the expiration date of the last to expire of the  911 patent, the  342 patent, and the  220 patent, including any extensions and/or pediatric exclusivities; or (b) the date that Par obtains final FDA approval of its ANDA, or earlier in certain circumstances. On December 11, 2015, Forest and Royalty entered into settlement agreements with Hetero and Glenmark. On January 8, 2016, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Amneal. On January 19, 2016, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex. The defendants under these agreements may enter the market as of March 19, 2026. A bench trial concluded on January 26, 2016. Post-trial briefing concluded on April 26, 2016. In June 2016, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Lupin. On July 11, 2016, the court entered an order, opinion and judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Mylan that Mylan infringes the asserted claims of the  911,  342 and  220 patents, and that the asserted claims of the  911,  342 and  220 patents are valid.  On August 9, 2016, Mylan filed a notice of appeal.  On September 30, 2016, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Mylan, and the appeal was dismissed.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Mylan may enter the market as of March 19, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances.  
 Teflaro    . In January 2015, Forest Laboratories, LLC, Forest Laboratories Holdings Ltd., and Cerexa, Inc. (collectively,  Forest ) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ( Takeda ), Forest s licensor for Teflaro   , brought an action for infringement of some or all of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,417,175 (the   175 patent ), 6,906,055 (the   055 patent ), 7,419,973 (the   973 patent ) and 8,247,400 (the   400 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Apotex and Sandoz, and related subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. These companies have notified Forest and Takeda that they have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Teflaro    before some or all of the  175,  055,  973 and  400 patents expire. (The  175 patent expires in April 2022, the  055 and  973 patents expire in December 2021, and the  400 patent expires in February 2031.) These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs until April 29, 2018 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest and Takeda sooner). On June 24, 2015, the District Court issued a scheduling order setting a trial date in June 2017.   
 In April 2016, Forest filed a complaint for infringement of the  175 patent in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Apotex. Apotex had notified Forest and Takeda that they have filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Teflaro    before the  175 patent expires in April 2022. This lawsuit triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDA with respect to the  175 patent until September 8, 2018 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest and Takeda sooner). In May 2016, Apotex filed an answer and counterclaim as to the  175 patent and Forest filed an answer to Apotex s counterclaims. On June 14, 2016, Allergan filed a motion for consolidation and the court entered an order consolidating  C.A. 1:16-cv-00269-GMS , into  C.A. 1:15-cv-00018-GMS,  (the  Lead  case). On July 27, 2016, Forest and Takeda dismissed the  055 and  973 patents with respect to Sandoz.  On August 5, 2016, Forest and Takeda dismissed the  175 patent as to Sandoz, leaving the  400 patent as the only patent asserted against Sandoz.  On November 11, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with respect to Sandoz, which the court ordered on November 17, 2016.  The  175 patent and the  400 patent continued to be asserted against Apotex.  On January 13, 2017, Forest and Takeda entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex. The Apotex matter was dismissed on January 17, 2017.   
   Viibryd    . In March 2015, Forest Laboratories, LLC, Forest Laboratories Holdings Ltd., (collectively,  Forest ) and Merck KGaA and Merck Patent Gesellschaft Mit Beschr nkter Haftung (collectively,  Merck ), Forest s licensor for Viibryd, brought actions for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,834,020 (the   020 patent ), 8,193,195 (the   195 patent ), 8,236,804 (the   804   
 F-97 

patent ) and 8,673,921 (the   921 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Accord Healthcare Inc. ( Accord ), Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. ( Alembic ), Apotex, Inc. ( Apotex ), InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( InvaGen ), and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ( Teva ), and related subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. These companies have notified Forest and/or Merck that they have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Viibryd before the  020,  195,  804 and  921 patents expire in June 2022. These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs until July 21, 2018 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest and Merck sooner). On August 24, 2015, the District Court consolidated the actions for all purposes and issued a scheduling order setting a trial date in January 2018. On November 23, 2015, Forest and Merck brought an action for infringement of the  020,  195,  804 and  921 patents in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against InvaGen, which matter was consolidated with the earlier-filed action against InvaGen.   
 Product Liability Litigation 
 Actonel      Litigation . Warner Chilcott is a defendant in approximately 164 cases and a potential defendant with respect to approximately 373 unfiled claims involving a total of approximately 446 plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs relating to Warner Chilcott s bisphosphonate prescription drug Actonel   . The claimants allege, among other things, that Actonel    caused them to suffer osteonecrosis of the jaw ( ONJ ), a rare but serious condition that involves severe loss or destruction of the jawbone, and/or atypical fractures of the femur. All of the cases have been filed in either federal or state courts in the United States. Warner Chilcott is in the initial stages of discovery in these litigations. In addition, Warner Chilcott is aware of four purported product liability class actions that were brought against Warner Chilcott in provincial courts in Canada alleging, among other things, that Actonel    caused the plaintiffs and the proposed class members who ingested Actonel    to suffer atypical fractures or other side effects. It is expected that these plaintiffs will seek class certification. Plaintiffs have typically asked for unspecified monetary and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys  fees. Warner Chilcott is indemnified by Sanofi for certain Actonel claims pursuant to a collaboration agreement relating to the two parties  co-promotion of the product in the United States and other countries. In addition, Warner Chilcott is also partially indemnified by the Procter   Gamble Company ( P G ) for ONJ claims that were pending at the time Warner Chilcott acquired P G s global pharmaceutical business in October 2009. In May and September 2013, Warner Chilcott entered into two settlement agreements that resolved a majority of the then-existing ONJ-related claims.  
 Benicar    Litigation.  Forest is named in approximately 1,733 actions involving allegations that Benicar   , a treatment for hypertension that Forest co-promoted with Daiichi Sankyo between 2002 and 2008, caused certain gastrointestinal injuries. Under Forest s Co-Promotion Agreement, Daiichi Sankyo is defending us in these lawsuits.  
 Celexa   /Lexapro    Litigation . Forest are defendants in approximately 179 actions alleging that Celexa    or Lexapro    caused various birth defects. Several of the cases involve multiple minor-plaintiffs. The majority of these actions have been consolidated in state court in Missouri. The company recently reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs to settle five of the pending cases.  There are birth defect cases pending in other jurisdictions, none of which are set for trial.   
 Testosterone Litigation . Beginning in 2014, a number of product liability suits were filed against Actavis, Inc., now known as Allergan Finance, LLC, and one or more of its former subsidiaries as well as other manufacturers and distributors of testosterone products, for personal injuries including but not limited to cardiovascular events allegedly arising out of the use of Androderm    and AndroGel   , a product that a subsidiary of the Company had co-promoted for another pharmaceutical company defendant.. There are approximately 562 currently pending actions which have been consolidated in an MDL in federal court in Illinois. The defendants have responded to the plaintiffs  master complaint in the MDL. These cases are in the initial stages and discovery is ongoing. The Company anticipates that additional suits will be filed.   
 Government Investigations, Government Litigation and Qui Tam Litigation 
 Forest.  Forest received a subpoena dated August 5, 2013 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. The subpoena requests documents relating to the marketing and promotion of Bystolic   , Savella   , and Namenda   , including with respect to speaker programs for these products. In February 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin unsealed a  qui tam  complaint which asserts claims under the False Claims Act and contains allegations regarding off-label promotion of Bystolic    and Savella    and  kickbacks  provided to physicians to induce prescriptions of Bystolic   , Savella   , and Viibryd   . Forest moved to dismiss the complaint. On January 6, 2015, the court granted Forest s motion to dismiss the complaint. On February 5, 2016, the relator filed a second amended complaint. The U.S. Attorney s Office declined to intervene in this action but has reserved the right to do so at a later date.  The Company recently reached an agreement with the Department of Justice, all fifty states and the District of Columbia as well as the relator that resolved both the government s investigation and the  qui tam  action.    
   Forest received a subpoena, dated April 29, 2015, from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General ( OIG ). The subpoena requests documents relating to Average Manufacturer ( AMP ) and Best Price calculations for  
 F-98 

several of its products. Subsequently, Forest received a Civil Investigative Demand from the OIG, dated August 16, 2016 primarily related to the calculation of Best Price. The Company is cooperating fully with the OIG s requests.  
 In April 2014, the federal district court in Massachusetts unsealed a  qui tam  complaint which asserts claims under the False Claims Act and contains allegations regarding off-label promotion of Namenda   . The Company filed a motion to dismiss the relator s Second Amended Complaint and the court granted in part and denied in part Forest s motion, dismissing the False Claims Act conspiracy claim only. While this case is still in its early stages, on October 7, 2016, the Company filed a second motion to dismiss the relator s Second Amended Complaint based on newly discovered evidence.  The U.S. Attorney s Office declined to intervene in this action but has reserved the right to do so at a later date.   
 Forest and certain of its affiliates are defendants in three state court actions pending in Illinois, Utah and Wisconsin involving  qui tam  actions alleging generally that the plaintiffs (all government agencies) were overcharged for their share of Medicaid drug reimbursement costs. Discovery is ongoing in these actions.  Forest and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss Utah s amended complaint. This motion to dismiss was denied in part, and discovery is proceeding. On February 17, 2014, the Wisconsin state court granted defendants  motion to dismiss plaintiff s Second Amended Complaint. However, the relator filed a separate action making the same basic allegations as in its amended complaint in the original action.  
 On December 28, 2015, a putative class action complaint was filed in state court in Pennsylvania on behalf of a putative class of private payers. Defendants removed the complaint to the federal court in Pennsylvania.  The complaint alleges that manufacturers of generic drugs, including a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. that in the past had marketed generic products, caused plaintiffs to overpay for prescription drug products through the use of inflated AWPs. The complaint alleges violations of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, negligent misrepresentation/fraud, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 29, 2016.  On May 3, 2016, the court issued an order staying this action.  An additional complaint then was filed in state court in Pennsylvania on behalf an individual indirect purchaser containing similar allegations to the class complaint.   
 Allergan . In December 2011, the federal district court in Pennsylvania issued an order partially unsealing the second amended  qui tam  complaint, filed by relators Herbert J. Nevyas, M.D. and Anita Nevyas-Wallace, M.D., to be informally provided to Allergan, Inc. The complaint asserts claims under Federal and State False Claims Acts and Federal and State Anti-Kickback Acts. On December 16, 2013, the court entered an order to unseal this  qui tam  action. On April 1, 2014, Allergan filed a motion to dismiss. On May 26, 2015, the court issued a ruling granting, in part, the motion to dismiss and denying it in part. Allergan filed an answer to the remaining claims on June 25, 2015.  In May 2016, the parties reached a settlement, which remains subject to approval by various Federal and State agencies.  
 On November 25, 2014, prior to the completion of its merger with Actavis plc ( Actavis ), Allergan, Inc. received a request for documents and information from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) related to Actavis or Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Salix ).  On June 30, 2015, Allergan, Inc. received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to Actavis or Salix.  On June 30, 2015, Actavis received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to Allergan.  In January 2016, the SEC began meeting with current and former employees of Allergan and Actavis and indicated that its review focused on the content of Allergan, Inc. s disclosures during the pendency of the tender offer by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International for Allergan, Inc. s common stock. The company recently reached an agreement with the SEC to resolve the SEC s review of legacy Allergan s disclosures during the Valeant tender offer period. 
 The Company and its affiliates are involved in various other disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquires, investigations and proceedings that could result in litigation, and other litigation matters that arise from time to time.  
   
                 Matters Relating to the Company s Divested Generics Business 
 The following matters relate to the former generics business of the Company which was sold to Teva effective August 2, 2016, but are included herein because the Company or one of its current subsidiaries have been named as a party in such matter.  The Master Purchase Agreement under which the global generics business was sold provides for assumption by Teva of liabilities and claims relating to the generics business and indemnification by Teva for losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by or asserted against the Company for third party claims relating to the generics business.  The Company believes it has substantial and meritorious claims for indemnification by Teva for these matters and failing same, substantial and meritorious defenses with respect to the underlying claims against the Company and/or its current subsidiaries; and in each case the Company intends to assert and/or defends claims vigorously.  However, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or indemnity claims. 
   Lidoderm      Litigation .  On March 30, 2016, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in federal district court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the Company and one of its global generics business subsidiaries, Watson Laboratories, Inc.,   
 F-99 

Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. and others arising out of patent settlements relating to Lidoderm and Opana ER. The Lidoderm settlement was reached by Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Watson Laboratories, Inc. in May 2012, prior to it s being affiliated with the Company, and all allegations against the Company and Watson Laboratories, Inc. related to the Lidoderm settlement only.  On October 25, 2016, the FTC voluntarily withdrew its complaint in federal court in Pennsylvania. Similar lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs were already pending in the federal district court in California.  On January 23, 2017, both the FTC and State of California filed complaints against the Watson Laboratories, Endo Pharmaceuticals as well as the Company and its subsidiary Allergan Finance LLC in the same federal court in California alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws.  The FTC and California complaints contain allegations relating to the Lidoderm settlement only and seek injunctive relief, restitution or disgorgement of profits and, in the California action, statutory penalties.  On January 27, 2017, Allergan Finance LLC filed a declaratory judgment action against the FTC in the same federal district court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania where the FTC s original action had been pending.  The court consolidated Allergan Finance s action with declaratory judgment actions that had already been filed by other parties that were named as defendants in the original FTC action in Pennsylvania.   
 Generic Drug Pricing  Securities and ERISA Litigation  .  On November 4, 2016 a class action was filed by a putative class of Allergan shareholders in federal court in California against the Company and certain of its current and former officers alleging that the Company and certain of its current and former officers made materially false and misleading statements.  The complaint alleges generally that between February 2014 and November 2016, Allergan and certain of its officers made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company s internal controls over its financial reporting and failed to disclose that its Actavis generics unit had engaged in illegal, anticompetitive price-fixing with its generic industry peers.  The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages.  Additional complaints have been filed in other federal district courts.  On February 2, 2017, the actions were consolidated in the federal district court in New Jersey. On February 14, 2017, a separate complaint was filed in the federal district court in California that is premised on the same alleged underlying conduct that is at issue in the securities litigation but that asserts claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA).  The ERISA complaint asserts claims on behalf of a putative class of individuals who participated in the Company s retirement plans and seeks an unspecified amount of damages and other injunctive relief.  
 Hydrocortisone Investigation . On November 10, 2016, the Company received notice from the UK Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) that it would be included within the scope of the CMA s formal investigation under Section 25 of the Competition Act of 1998 ( CA98 ) into suspected abuse of dominance by a former generics business subsidiary of the Company in relation to the supply of 10mg and 20mg hydrocortisone tablets. The CMA is investigating whether the conduct infringes the Chapter II prohibition of the CA98 and/or Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Company intends to cooperate fully with the investigation.

NOTE 26   Compensation   
 The following table represents compensation costs for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 ($ in millions): 

NOTE 27   Concentration 
 The Company considers there to be a concentration risk for customers that account for 10% or more of their third party revenues. The following table illustrates any customer, on a global basis, which accounted for 10% or more of our annual revenues in any of the past three fiscal years and the respective percentage of our revenues for which they account for each of the last three years:  

Changes in the mix of concentration amongst the Company s largest customers are due, in part, to the impact of acquisitions as well as changes in the supply chain of our indirect customers. 
 The Company s accounts receivable primarily arise from product sales in North America and Europe and primarily represent amounts due from wholesalers, distributors, drug store chains and service providers in the health care and pharmaceutical industries, public hospitals and other government entities. Approximately 59% and 72% of the gross accounts receivable balance are concentrated among the Company s three largest customers as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for potential uncollectible accounts. Actual losses from uncollectible accounts have been minimal. 
 Outside of the U.S., concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using the Company s products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. The Company monitors economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies, and related impacts on the relevant financial markets and its business, especially in light of sovereign credit issues. The Company does not expect to have write-offs or adjustments to accounts receivable which would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
 Certain of the Company s finished products and raw materials are obtained from single source suppliers. Although the Company seeks to identify more than one source for its various finished products and raw materials, loss of a single source supplier could have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, a second source supplier may not be able to produce the same volumes of inventory as the Company s primary supplier. No third party manufacturer accounted for 10% or more of the Company s products sold based on third-party revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.

 Assembly Biosciences, Inc. 
 On January 9, 2017 the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Assembly Biosciences, Inc. ( Assembly ) for the worldwide rights to Assembly's microbiome GI development programs.

Under the terms of the agreement, Allergan made an upfront payment to Assembly of $50.0 million for the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the UC, CD and IBS compounds, which was recorded as a component of R D expense in the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, Assembly will be eligible to receive success-based development and commercial milestone payments. Assembly is also eligible to receive tiered royalties based on net sales. Allergan and Assembly will generally share development costs through proof-of-concept (POC) studies, and Allergan will assume all post-POC development costs.  
 Lysosomal Therapeutics, Inc. 
 On January 9, 2017 the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc. ( LTI ). LTI is focused on innovative small-molecule research and development in the field of neurodegeneration, yielding new treatment options for patients with severe neurological diseases. LTI-291, LTI's lead program, aims to stimulate the activity of glucocerebrosidase in the brain. Under the option agreement, Allergan purchased an option right directly from LTI shareholders to acquire LTI following completion of a Phase 1b trial for LTI-291.  In addition, Allergan provided a separate upfront research and development payment. The net payment of $145 million will be recorded as a component of R D expense in the year ended December 31, 2017. Allergan and LTI will establish a joint development committee to oversee the development activities for LTI-291.
