customers. The retail sales include commercial, industrial and residential customers. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to ensure delivery of energy to both wholesale and retail customers under long-term and short-term contracts,
and in wholesale power markets. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Generation s fleet also provides geographic and supply source diversity.
Generation s customers include distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, financial institutions, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generation s customer facing
activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers.    Generation is a public
utility under the Federal Power Act and is subject to FERC s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority
to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. FERC s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of
utilities and set cost-based rates should FERC find that its previous grant of market-based rates authority is no longer just and reasonable. Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, third-party financings; review
of mergers; dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility; affiliate transactions; intercompany financings and cash management arrangements; certain
internal corporate reorganizations; and certain holding company acquisitions of public utility and holding company securities. Additionally, ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by
RTOs in markets regulated by FERC. Specific operations of Generation are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including the NRC and Federal and state environmental protection agencies.
Additionally, Generation is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of FERC.    RTOs and ISOs exist in a
number of regions to provide transmission service across multiple transmission systems. PJM, MISO,  ISO-NE  and SPP, have been approved by FERC as RTOs, and CAISO and
 ISO-NY  have been approved as ISOs. These entities are responsible for regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability, market
monitoring, the scheduling of physical power sales brokered through ICE and NYMEX and the elimination or reduction of redundant transmission charges imposed by multiple transmission providers when wholesale customers take transmission service across
several transmission systems.

    Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, Inc.    
 Generation owns a 50.01% interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF. CENG is governed by a board of ten directors, five of which are appointed by
Generation and five by EDF. CENG owns a total of five nuclear generating facilities on three sites, Calvert Cliffs, R.E. Ginna and Nine Mile Point. CENG s ownership share in the total capacity of these units is 4,007 MW. See ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES for additional information on these sites.    Generation and EDF also entered into a Put Option Agreement on April 1, 2014, pursuant
to which EDF has the option, exercisable beginning on January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022, to sell its 49.99% interest in CENG to Generation for a fair market value price determined by agreement of the parties, or absent
agreement, a third-party arbitration process. In addition, under limited circumstances, the period for exercise of the put option may be extended for 18 months.  
 Prior to April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation accounted for their investment in CENG under the equity method of accounting. The transfer of the
nuclear operating licenses and the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, resulted in the derecognition of the equity method investment in CENG and the recording of all assets, liabilities and EDF s noncontrolling interests in CENG at
fair value on a fully consolidated basis in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information regarding the integration transaction.      Acquisitions    
   ConEdison Solutions.   On September 1, 2016, Generation acquired the competitive retail electric and natural gas business activities of

  See Note 26 Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on revenues from external customers and revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for each of Generation s reportable segments.  
   Nuclear Facilities      Generation has ownership interests
in fourteen nuclear generating stations currently in service, consisting of 24 units with an aggregate of 19,457 MW of capacity. Generation wholly owns all of its nuclear generating stations, except for Quad Cities Generating Station (75%
ownership), Peach Bottom Generating Station (50% ownership), and Salem Generating Station (Salem) (42.59% ownership), which are consolidated on Exelon s and Generation s financial statements relative to its proportionate ownership interest
in each unit. In addition, Generation owns a 50.01% interest, collectively, in the CENG generating stations (Calvert Cliffs, Nine Mile Point [excluding LIPA s 18% ownership interest in Nine Mile Point Unit 2] and R.E. Ginna) which are 100%
consolidated on Exelon and Generation s financial statements as of April 1, 2014. See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of the Future Energy Jobs Bill and New York CES on certain nuclear plants.  
 Generation s nuclear generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of the two units at Salem, which are operated by PSEG
Nuclear, LLC (PSEG Nuclear), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG. In 2016, 2015 and 2014 electric supply (in GWh) generated from the nuclear generating facilities was 67%, 68% and 67%, respectively, of Generation s total electric
supply, which also includes fossil, hydroelectric and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale. The majority of this output was dispatched to support Generation s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. See ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further discussion of Generation s electric supply sources.  
 On August 8, 2016, Generation executed a series of agreements with Entergy Nuclear FitzPatrick LLC (Entergy) to acquire the 838MW single-unit James
A. FitzPatrick (FitzPatrick) nuclear generating station located in Scriba, New York. Closing of the transaction is currently anticipated to occur in the first half of 2017 and requires regulatory approval by FERC, NRC and the New York Public Service
Commission (NYPSC). The transaction is also subject to the notification and reporting requirements of the HSR Act (which has been completed) and other customary closing conditions. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the proposed acquisition of the FitzPatrick nuclear generating station.  
   Nuclear Operations.   Capacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and  non-refueling  outages, can have a significant impact on Generation s results of operations. As the largest generator of nuclear power in the United States, Generation can negotiate favorable terms for the
materials and services that its business requires. Generation s operations from its nuclear plants have historically had minimal environmental impact and the plants have a safe operating history.  
 During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the nuclear generating facilities operated by Generation achieved capacity factors of 94.6%, 93.7% and 94.3%, respectively.
The capacity factors reflect ownership percentage of stations operated by Generation and include CENG as of April 1, 2014. Generation manages its scheduled refueling outages to minimize their duration and to maintain high nuclear generating
capacity factors, resulting in a stable generation base for Generation s wholesale and retail  
      12  

Table of Contents  

marketing and trading activities. During scheduled refueling outages, Generation performs maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to
maintain safe, reliable operations.    In addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by Generation during scheduled refueling
outages, Generation has extensive operating and security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of the nuclear units. Generation has extensive safety systems in place to protect the plant, personnel and surrounding area in the unlikely
event of an accident or other incident.      Regulation of Nuclear Power Generation.   Generation is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC
with respect to the operation of its nuclear generating stations, including the licensing for operation of each unit. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations,
maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. As part of its reactor oversight process, the NRC continuously assesses unit performance indicators and inspection results, and communicates its
assessment on a semi-annual basis. As of January 30, 2017, the NRC categorized Ginna in the Regulatory Response Column, which is the second highest of five performance bands. All other units operated by Generation are categorized in the
Licensee Response Column, which is the highest performance band. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of the
operating licenses. Changes in regulations by the NRC may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures for nuclear generating facilities and/or increased operating costs of nuclear generating units.  
 For information on the NRC actions related to the Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and the industry s response, see ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview.      Licenses   .  Generation has
original  40-year  operating licenses from the NRC for each of its nuclear units and has received  20-year  operating license renewals from the NRC for all its nuclear units
except Clinton. Additionally, PSEG has received  20-year  operating license renewals for Salem Units 1 and 2. On December 8, 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation
operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019.  
      13  

Table of Contents  

  The following table summarizes the current operating license expiration dates for Generation s nuclear
facilities in service:      

(a) 
 Denotes year in which nuclear unit began commercial operations.    

(b) 
 Although timing has been delayed, Generation currently plans to seek license renewal for Clinton and has advised the NRC that any license renewal application would not be filed until the first quarter of 2021.

The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process until completion of the
NRC s review. The NRC review process takes approximately two years from the docketing of an application. To date, each granted license renewal has been for 20 years beyond the original operating license expiration. Depreciation provisions are
based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the actual renewal of operating licenses for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek and Clinton. Oyster Creek depreciation provisions
are based on the 2019 expected shutdown date. Clinton depreciation provisions are based on 2027 which is the last year of the Illinois Zero Emissions Standard. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional detail on the new Illinois legislation and Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the reversal of the decision to early retire
Clinton.    In August 2012, Generation entered into an operating services agreement with the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) to provide operational
and managerial support services for the Fort Calhoun Station and a licensing agreement for use of the Exelon Nuclear Management Model. On  
      14  

Table of Contents  

December 16, 2016, Generation was notified by OPPD of the termination of the operating services agreement for Fort Calhoun Station effective June 14, 2017. OPPD has the option to
continue to use the Exelon Nuclear Management Model for payment of a fee.      Nuclear Waste Storage and Disposal.   There are no facilities
for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the United States, nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. Generation currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities  on-site  in storage pools or in dry cask storage facilities. Since Generation s SNF storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant, Generation has developed
dry cask storage facilities to support operations.    As of December 31, 2016, Generation had approximately 77,900 SNF assemblies (19,200 tons)
stored on site in SNF pools or dry cask storage (this includes SNF assemblies at Zion Station, for which Generation retains ownership even though the responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station has been assumed by another party; see Note
16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning). All currently operating Generation-owned nuclear sites have  on-site  dry cask storage, except for Three Mile Island, where such storage is projected to be in operation in 2023.  On-site  dry cask storage in concert with  on-site  storage pools will be capable of meeting all current and future SNF storage requirements at Generation s sites through the end of the license renewal periods and through decommissioning.  
 For a discussion of matters associated with Generation s contracts with the DOE for the disposal of SNF, see Note 24 Commitments and
Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    As a  by-product  of their
operations, nuclear generating units produce LLRW. LLRW is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed of at licensed disposal facilities. The Federal  Low-Level  Radioactive Waste Policy Act
of 1980 provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for LLRW and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated within the region. Illinois and Kentucky have entered into such an agreement, although
neither state currently has an operational site and none is anticipated to be operational until after 2020.    Generation ships its Class A LLRW,
which represents 93% of LLRW generated at its stations, to disposal facilities in Utah and South Carolina. The disposal facility in South Carolina at present is only receiving LLRW from LLRW generators in South Carolina, New Jersey (which includes
Oyster Creek and Salem), and Connecticut.    Generation utilizes  on-site  storage capacity at all its stations
to store and stage for shipping Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation has a contract through 2032 to ship Class B and Class C LLRW to a disposal facility in Texas. The agreement provides for disposal of all current Class B
and Class C LLRW currently stored at each station as well as the Class B and Class C LLRW generated during the term of the agreement. However, because the production of LLRW from Generation s nuclear fleet will exceed the
capacity at the Texas site (3.9 million curies for 15 years beginning in 2012), Generation will still be required to utilize  on-site  storage at its stations for Class B and Class C LLRW.
Generation currently has enough storage capacity to store all Class B and C LLRW for the life of all stations in Generation s nuclear fleet. Generation continues to pursue alternative disposal strategies for LLRW, including an LLRW
reduction program to minimize cost impacts and  on-site  storage.      Nuclear Insurance.   Generation
is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations, including the CENG nuclear stations. Generation has  
      15  

Table of Contents  

reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions. See  Nuclear Insurance  within Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of
the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details.    For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES Generation. Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the policy deductible for its insured losses. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on
Exelon s and Generation s future financial conditions and results of operations and cash flows.      Decommissioning.   NRC
regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. See ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview; ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates, Nuclear Decommissioning, Asset Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments; and Note 3 Regulatory Matters, Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note
16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Generation s NDT funds and its decommissioning obligations. The ultimate decommissioning obligation will be
funded by the NDTs. The NDTs are recorded on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016 at fair value of approximately $11.1 billion and have an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return of 5.3% to 5.9%.  
  Zion Station Decommissioning.  On December 11, 2007, Generation entered into an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions, Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions, LLC (ZionSolutions) under which ZionSolutions assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in
1998.    On September 1, 2010, Generation and EnergySolutions completed the transactions contemplated by the ASA. Specifically, Generation
transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for Generation s transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed
decommissioning and other liabilities, excluding the obligation to dispose of SNF, associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions will periodically request reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred
related to the decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. However, ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursement; specifically, if certain milestones as defined in the ASA are not met, all or a portion of
requested reimbursements shall be deferred until such milestones are met. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning and
see Note 2 Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of variable interest entity considerations related to ZionSolutions.  
   Fossil and Renewable Facilities (including Hydroelectric)    
 At December 31, 2016, Generation had ownership interests in 13,263 MW of capacity in generating facilities currently in service, consisting of 9,522 MW
of natural gas and oil, 3,715 MW of renewables (wind, hydroelectric, and solar) and 26 MW of waste coal. Generation wholly owns all of its fossil and renewable generating stations, with the exception of: (1) jointly owned facilities that
include Wyman; (2) certain wind project entities with minority interest owners; and (3) an ownership interest in the Albany Green Energy, LLC project entity, see Note 2 Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain of these entities which are VIEs. Generation s fossil and renewable generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of LaPorte
 
      16  

Table of Contents  

and Wyman, which are operated by third parties. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, electric supply (in GWh) generated from owned fossil and renewable generating facilities was 10%, 8% and 13%, respectively,
of Generation s total electric supply. The majority of this output was dispatched to support Generation s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. For additional information regarding Generation s electric generating
facilities, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Exelon Generation Company, LLC and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview for additional information on
Generation Renewable Development.      Licenses.   Fossil and renewable generation plants are generally not licensed, and, therefore, the
decision on when to retire plants is, fundamentally, a commercial one. FERC has the exclusive authority to license most  non-Federal  hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or Federal lands, or
connected to the interstate electric grid. On August 29, 2012 and August 30, 2012, Generation submitted hydroelectric license applications to the FERC for  46-year  licenses for the Conowingo
Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo) and the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility Project (Muddy Run), respectively. On December 22, 2015, FERC issued a new  40-year  license for Muddy Run. The license term
expires on December 1, 2055. Based on the FERC procedural schedule, the FERC licensing process was not completed prior to the expiration of Conowingo s license on September 1, 2014. FERC is required to issue an annual license for the
facility until the new license is issued. On September 10, 2014, FERC issued an annual license for Conowingo, effective as of the expiration of the previous license. If FERC does not issue a new license prior to the expiration of annual
license, the annual license will renew automatically. The stations are currently being depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which includes actual and anticipated license renewal periods. Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.      Insurance.   Generation maintains business interruption
insurance for its renewable and fossil projects, and delay in  start-up  insurance for its renewable and fossil projects currently under construction. Generation does not purchase business interruption insurance
for its wholly owned fossil and hydroelectric operations, unless required by financing agreements; see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financing
agreements. Generation maintains both property damage and liability insurance. For property damage and liability claims for these operations, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount
of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s future financial conditions and their results of operations and cash flows. For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2.

    Long-Term Power Purchase Contracts    
 In addition to energy produced by owned generation assets, Generation sources electricity and other related output from plants it does not own under
long-term contracts. The following tables summarize Generation s long-term contracts to purchase unit-specific physical power with an original term in excess of one year in duration, by region, in effect as of December 31, 2016:  

Fuel      The following
table shows sources of electric supply in GWh for 2016 and 2015:      

(a) 
 Includes the proportionate share of output where Generation has an undivided ownership interest in jointly-owned generating plants and includes the total output of plants that are fully consolidated (e.g., CENG).
Nuclear generation for 2016 and 2015 includes physical volumes of 33,444 GWh and 33,415 GWh, respectively, for CENG.    

(b) 
 Includes wind, hydroelectric, and solar generating assets.      The fuel costs per MWh for nuclear
generation are less than those for fossil-fuel generation. Consequently, nuclear generation is generally the most cost-effective way for Generation to meet its wholesale and retail load servicing requirements.  
 The cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates, the conversion of
uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. Generation has uranium concentrate inventory and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium concentrate
requirements through 2018. Generation s contracted conversion services are sufficient to meet all of its uranium conversion requirements through 2017. All of Generation s enrichment requirements have been contracted through 2020. Contracts
for fuel fabrication have been obtained through 2022. Generation does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion, enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of its nuclear
units.    Natural gas is procured through long-term and short-term contracts, as well as spot-market purchases. Fuel oil inventories are managed so
that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are  
      18  

Table of Contents  

available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market pricing.  
 Generation uses financial instruments to mitigate price risk associated with certain commodity price exposures. Generation also hedges forward price
risk, using both   over-the-counter   and exchange-traded instruments. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments.
     Power Marketing      Generation s integrated
business operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and through long-term, intermediate-term and short-term contracts. Generation maintains an effective supply strategy through ownership
of generation assets and power purchase and lease agreements. Generation has also contracted for access to additional generation through bilateral long-term PPAs. PPAs, including tolling agreements, are commitments related to power generation of
specific generation plants and/or are dispatchable in nature similar to asset ownership depending on the type of underlying asset. Generation secures contracted generation as part of its overall strategic plan, with objectives such as obtaining  low-cost  energy supply sources to meet its physical delivery obligations to both wholesale and retail customers and assisting customers to meet renewable portfolio standards. Generation sells electricity, natural
gas, and other energy related products and solutions to various customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generation s
customer facing operations combine a unified sales force with a customer-centric model that leverages technology to broaden the range of products and solutions offered, which Generation believes promotes stronger customer relationships. This model
focuses on efficiency and cost reduction, which provides a platform that is scalable and able to capitalize on opportunities for future growth.  
 Generation may purchase more than the energy demanded by its customers. Generation then sells this open position, along with capacity not used to meet
customer demand, in the wholesale electricity markets. Where necessary, Generation also purchases transmission service to ensure that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its power supplies to meet customer delivery needs in
markets without an organized RTO. Generation also incorporates contingencies into its planning for extreme weather conditions, including potentially reserving capacity to meet summer loads at levels representative of warmer-than-normal weather
conditions.      Price Supply Risk Management    
 Generation also manages the price and supply risks for energy and fuel associated with generation assets and the risks of power marketing activities.
Generation implements a three-year ratable sales plan to align its hedging strategy with its financial objectives. Generation also enters into transactions that are outside of this ratable sales plan. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk in
2017 and beyond for portions of its electricity portfolio that are unhedged. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate this risk in subsequent years. As of December 31, 2016, the percentage of
expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was  91%-94%,   56%-59%  and  28%-31%  for 2017, 2018, and 2019,
respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or
contracted generating facilities based upon a simulated dispatch model that  
      19  

Table of Contents  

makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products,
which include economic hedges and certain  non-derivative  contracts, including sales to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE to serve their retail load. A portion of Generation s hedging strategy may be
implemented through the use of fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. The corporate risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of the wholesale
and retail power marketing activities. Generation also uses financial and commodity contracts for proprietary trading purposes, but this activity accounts for only a small portion of Generation s efforts. The proprietary trading portfolio is
subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including volume, stop-loss and   value-at-risk   limits, to manage exposure to market

  Service Territories.  The following table presents the size of retail service territories, populations of each retail service territory and the
number of retail customers within each retail service territory for the Utility Registrants as of December 31, 2016:      

(a) 
 Includes approximately 2.7 million in the city of Chicago.    

(b) 
 Includes approximately 1.6 million in the city of Philadelphia.    

(c) 
 Includes approximately 0.6 million in the city of Baltimore.    

(d) 
 Includes approximately 0.7 million in the District of Columbia.    

(e) 
 Includes approximately 0.1 million in the city of Wilmington.    

(f) 
 Includes approximately 0.1 million in the city of Atlantic City.       Peak Deliveries.  The
Utility Registrants   electric sales and peak load are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. For PECO, BGE and DPL natural gas sales are
generally higher during the winter months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating.  
      23  

Table of Contents  

  The following table summarizes historic peak deliveries for the Utility Registrants for electric and gas
deliveries during peak demand months through December 31, 2016:      
    Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Services.  The Utility Registrants are allowed to recover reasonable costs
and fair and prudent capital expenditures associated with electric and natural gas distribution services and earn a return on those capital expenditures, subject to commission approval. ComEd recovers costs through a performance-based rate formula,
pursuant to EIMA. ComEd is required to file an update to the performance-based rate formula on an annual basis. PECO s, BGE s and DPL s electric and gas distribution costs and Pepco s and ACE s electric distribution costs
are recovered through traditional rate case proceedings. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants use specific recovery mechanisms as approved by their respective regulatory agencies.  
 ComEd, Pepco, and ACE customers have the choice to purchase electricity, and PECO, BGE, and DPL customers have the choice to purchase electricity and
natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. The Utility Registrants remain the distribution service providers for all customers and are obligated to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in their respective
service territories while charging a regulated rate for distribution service. In addition, the Utility Registrants also retain significant default service obligations to provide electricity to certain groups of customers in their respective service
areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier. PECO and BGE also retain significant default service obligations to provide natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a
competitive natural gas supplier. For natural gas, DPL does not retain default service obligations. For those customers that choose a competitive electric generation or natural gas supplier, the Utility Registrants may act as the billing agent but
do not record revenues or purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas. For those customers that choose one of the Utility Registrants as their electric generation or natural gas supplier, the Utility Registrants
are permitted to recover electric and natural gas procurement costs from retail customers. Therefore, fluctuations in electric and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on electric and natural gas revenues net of purchased power and fuel
expense.    The following table outlines the state regulatory agencies and default service obligations for each of the Utility Registrants:

  Retail customers participating in customer choice programs, and retail deliveries purchased from
competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of GWh and mmcf sales, respectively) for the Utility Registrants consisted of the following at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:  

(a) 
 In September 2015, the City of Chicago discontinued its participation in the customer choice program and began purchasing its electricity from ComEd. Approximately 670,000 customers were impacted by the City of
Chicago s decision which resulted in the reduction in the number of customers participating in customer choice programs in 2015.    
  Procurement-Related Proceedings.  The Utility Registrants  electric supply for its customers is primarily procured through contracts as
required by the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC and NJBPU. The Utility Registrants procure electricity supply from various approved bidders, including Generation. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts with Generation are
included in Purchased power from affiliates on the Utility Registrants  Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
      25  

Table of Contents  

  PECO s, BGE s and DPL s natural gas supplies are purchased from a number of suppliers for
terms of up to three years. PECO, BGE and DPL have annual firm supply and transportation contracts of 132,000 mmcf, 128,000 mmcf and 58,000 mmcf, respectively. In addition, to supplement gas supply at times of heavy winter demands and in the event
of temporary emergencies, PECO, BGE and DPL have available storage capacity from the following sources:      

PECO, BGE and DPL have long-term interstate pipeline contracts and also participate in the interstate markets by releasing pipeline capacity or bundling
pipeline capacity with gas for  off-system  sales.  Off-system  gas sales are  low-margin  direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers
of natural gas. Earnings from these activities are shared between the utilities and customers. PECO, BGE and DPL make these sales as part of a program to balance its supply and cost of natural gas.  
  Energy Efficiency Programs.  The Utility Registrants are also allowed to recover costs associated with energy efficiency and demand response
programs. Each commission approved program seeks to meet mandated electric consumption reduction targets and implement demand response measures to reduce peak demand. The programs are designed to meet standards required by each respective regulatory
agency.     Capital Investment.  The Utility Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments, primarily in
electric transmission and distribution and natural gas transportation and distribution facilities, to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability and efficiency of their systems. ComEd s, PECO s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and
ACE s most recent estimates of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements for 2017 are $2,200 million, $775 million, $925 million, $625 million, $375 million and $300 million, respectively.  
 ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco and DPL have AMI smart meter and smart grid deployment programs within their respective service territories to enhance their
distribution systems. PECO, BGE, Pepco and DPL have completed the installation and activation of smart meters in their respective service territories. ACE has yet to receive approval from the NJBPU to proceed with the installation of AMI smart
meters.     Transmission Services.      The Utility Registrants provide unbundled transmission service under rates approved by FERC.
Under FERC s open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, the Utility Registrants, as owners of transmission facilities, are required to provide open access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at
cost-based rates. The Utility Registrants and their affiliates are required to comply with FERC s Standards of Conduct regulation governing the communication of  non-public  transmission information between
the transmission owner s employees and wholesale merchant employees.    PJM is the regional grid operator and operates pursuant to FERC-approved
tariffs. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of, the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (PJM Tariff). PJM operates the PJM energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, controls the   day-to-day   operations of the bulk power system for the PJM region. The Utility Registrants  
      26  

Table of Contents  

are members of PJM and provide regional transmission service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. The Utility Registrants and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of their
transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are under the dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM
transmission owners at rates based on the costs of transmission service.    ComEd s transmission rates are established based on a formula that
was approved by FERC in January 2008. BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s transmission rates are established based on a formula that was approved by FERC in April 2006. FERC s orders establish the agreed-upon treatment of costs
and revenues in the determination of network service transmission rates and the process for updating the formula rate calculation on an annual basis.  
 PECO s customers are charged for PECO s PJM retail transmission services on a full and current basis through a Transmission Service Charge
(applicable to default service only) and through a  Non-Bypassable  Transmission Charge (applicable to all distribution customers) in accordance with PECO s approved distribution rates.

    Employees     As of December 31,
2016, Exelon and its subsidiaries had 34,396 employees in the following companies, of which 11,984 or 35% were covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs):      

(a) 
 A separate CBA between ComEd and IBEW Local 15 covers approximately 62 employees in ComEd s System Services Group and was renewed in 2016. Generation s and ComEd s separate CBAs with IBEW Local 15 will
expire in 2022.    

(b) 
 1,310 PECO craft and call center employees in the Philadelphia service territory are covered by CBAs with IBEW Local 614, both expiring in 2021. Additionally, Exelon Power, an operating unit of Generation, has an
agreement covering 99 employees, which was renewed in 2016 and expiring in 2019.    
 
      27

(d) 
 In January 2017, an election was held at BGE which resulted in union representation for approximately 1,400 employees. BGE and IBEW Local 410 will begin negotiations for an initial agreement which could result in some
modifications to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment. No agreement has been finalized to date and management cannot predict the outcome of such negotiations.    

(e) 
 PHI s utility subsidiaries are parties to five collective bargaining agreements with four local unions. Collective bargaining agreements are generally renegotiated every three to five years. All of these collective
bargaining agreements were renegotiated in 2014 and were extended through various dates ranging from October 2018 through June 2020    

(f) 
 Other includes shared services employees at BSC.         Environmental Regulation   
   General      The Registrants are subject to comprehensive
and complex legislation regarding environmental matters by the federal government and various state and local jurisdictions in which they operate their facilities. The Registrants are also subject to regulations administered by the EPA and various
state and local environmental protection agencies. Federal, state and local regulation includes the authority to regulate air, water, and solid and hazardous waste disposal.  
 The Exelon Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the management of environmental matters. Exelon has a management team to address
environmental compliance and strategy, including the CEO; the Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer; the Corporate Environmental Strategy Director and the Environmental Regulatory Strategy Director, as well as
senior management of Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE. Performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance
review process. The Exelon Board of Directors has delegated to its Corporate Governance Committee the authority to oversee Exelon s compliance with laws and regulations and its strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the
environment, including Exelon s climate change and sustainability policies and programs, as discussed in further detail below. The Exelon Board of Directors has also delegated to its Generation Oversight Committee the authority to oversee
environmental, health and safety issues relating to Generation. The respective Boards of ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE oversee environmental, health and safety issues related to these companies.  
   Air Quality      Air quality regulations promulgated by
the EPA and the various state and local environmental agencies in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act impose restrictions on emission of particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO2),
nitrogen oxides (NOx), mercury and other pollutants and require permits for operation of emissions sources. Such permits have been obtained by Exelon s subsidiaries and must be renewed periodically. The Clean Air Act establishes a comprehensive
and complex national program to substantially reduce air pollution from power plants.    See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information regarding clean air regulation in the forms of the CSAPR, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants from coal- and  oil-fired  electric
generating facilities under MATS, and regulation of GHG emissions.      Water Quality    
 Under the Clean Water Act, NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the EPA or from the state environmental agency to
which the permit program has been delegated and must be renewed periodically. Certain of Generation s power generation facilities  
      28  

Table of Contents  

discharge industrial wastewater into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and operate under NPDES permits or pending applications for renewals of such permits after being
granted an administrative extension. Generation is also subject to the jurisdiction of certain other state and regional agencies and compacts, including the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission.  
   Section         316(b) of the Clean Water Act.   Section 316(b) requires that the cooling water intake
structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generation s power generation facilities with cooling
water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by any changes to the existing regulations. For Generation, those facilities are Calvert Cliffs,
Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Ginna, Gould Street, Handley, Mountain Creek, Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Riverside and Salem.  
 On October 14, 2014, the EPA s final Section 316(b) rule became effective. The rule requires that a series of studies and analyses be
performed to determine the best technology available to minimize adverse impacts on aquatic life, followed by an implementation period for the selected technology. The timing of the various requirements for each facility is related to the status of
its current NPDES permit and the subsequent renewal period. There is no fixed compliance schedule, as this is left to the discretion of the state permitting director  
 Until the compliance requirements are determined by the applicable state permitting director on a site-specific basis for each plant, Generation cannot
estimate the effect that compliance with the rule will have on the operation of its generating facilities and its future results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Should a state permitting director determine that a facility must
install cooling towers to comply with the rule, that facility s economic viability could be called into question. However, the potential impact of the rule has been significantly reduced since the final rule does not mandate cooling towers as a
national standard and sets forth technologies that are presumptively compliant, and the state permitting director is required to apply a cost-benefit test and can take into consideration site-specific factors.  
 Pursuant to discussions with the NJDEP in 2010 regarding the application of Section 316(b) to Oyster Creek, Generation agreed to permanently cease
generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019, ten years before the expiration of its operating license in 2029. The agreement only applies to Oyster Creek based on its unique circumstances and does not set any precedent for the
ultimate compliance requirements for Section 316(b) at Exelon s other plants.      New York Facilities  . In July 2011, the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) issued a policy regarding the best available technology for cooling water intake structures. Through its policy, the DEC established closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent as the performance goal for
all existing facilities, but also provided that the DEC will select a feasible technology whose costs are not wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits to be gained and allows for a site-specific determination where the entrainment
performance goal cannot be achieved. The Ginna and Nine Mile Point Unit 1 power generation facilities received renewals of their state water discharge permits in 2014.  
   Salem.   In June 2001, the NJDEP issued a renewed NPDES permit for Salem, expiring in July 2006, allowing for the continued operation of
Salem with its existing cooling water system. In February 2006, PSEG filed a renewal application with the NJDEP allowing Salem to continue operating under its existing NPDES permit until a new permit is issued. On June 30, 2015, NJDEP issued a
draft NPDES permit for Salem. The draft permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to  
      29  

Table of Contents  

continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system with certain required system modifications. On July 28, 2016, the NJDEP issued a final permit for Salem that did
not require the installation of cooling towers. However, the permit is being challenged by an environmental organization, and if successful, could result in additional costs for Clean Water Act compliance.  
   Solid and Hazardous Waste      CERCLA provides for
immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the EPA either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or
potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under CERCLA, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly,
jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of waste at sites, most of which are listed by the EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with an  EPA-directed  cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the EPA concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight prior to listing on
the NPL. Various states, including Delaware, District of Colombia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, have also enacted statutes that contain provisions substantially similar to CERCLA. In addition, RCRA governs treatment, storage and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted.    Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE
and their subsidiaries are, or are likely to become, parties to proceedings initiated by the EPA, state agencies and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA with respect to a number of sites, including MGP sites, or may undertake to
investigate and remediate sites for which they may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third-party.    See Note 24 Commitments and
Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding solid and hazardous waste regulation and legislation.  
   Environmental Remediation      ComEd s, PECO s
and BGE s environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at former MGP sites. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, have an  on-going  process to recover environmental remediation costs of the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. While BGE does not have a rider for MGP  clean-up  costs,
BGE has historically received recovery of actual  clean-up  costs on a site-specific basis in distribution rates. The amount to be expended in 2017 at Exelon for compliance with environmental remediation related
to contamination at former MGP sites and other gas purification sites is expected to total $41 million, consisting of $35 million and $6 million respectively, at ComEd and PECO.  
 Generation s environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at current and former generation and waste storage facilities. As of
December 31, 2016, Generation has established appropriate contingent liabilities for potential environmental remediation requirements including contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a storage and reprocessing facility
named Latty Avenue, and at a disposal facility named West Lake Landfill, both near St. Louis, Missouri related to operations conducted by Cotter Corporation, a former ComEd subsidiary.  
 The Utility Registrants also have environmental liabilities for remediation considerations. As of December 31, 2016, Generation has established
appropriate contingent liabilities for potential environmental remediation requirements.  
      30  

Table of Contents  

  In addition, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE may be required to make significant
additional expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs.    See Notes 3 Regulatory Matters and
24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  environmental remediation efforts and related impacts to the Registrants  results of
operations, cash flows and financial positions.      Global Climate Change    
 Exelon has utility and generation assets, and customers, that are subject to the effects of climate change as described in the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report, published in 2014, Accordingly the company is engaged in a variety of initiatives to better understand and develop responses to these issues, including investments in resiliency, partnering with federal,
state and local governments and advocating for science-based public policy. Exelon, as a producer of electricity from predominantly  low-carbon  generating facilities (such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and
solar photovoltaic), has a relatively small greenhouse gas (GHG) emission profile, or carbon footprint, compared to other domestic generators of electricity. By virtue of its significant investment in
 low-carbon  intensity assets, Generation s emission intensity, or rate of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted per unit of electricity generated, is among the lowest in the industry. Exelon does
produce GHG emissions, primarily at its fossil fuel-fired generating plants (primarily natural gas); CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are all emitted in this process, with CO2 representing the largest portion of these GHG emissions. GHG emissions from
combustion of fossil fuels represented the majority of Exelon s direct GHG emissions in 2016, although less than 30 percent of its owned generating capacity utilizes fossil fuels with less than 10 percent of owned generation MWh
actually produced by fossil fuels as Exelon s fossil-fired generation is primarily intermediate and peaking in nature. Other GHG emission sources at Exelon include natural gas (methane) leakage on the natural gas systems, sulfur hexafluoride
(SF6) leakage in its electric transmission and distribution operations and refrigerant leakage from its chilling and cooling equipment as well as fossil fuel combustion in its motor vehicles and fossil fuel generation of electricity used to power
its facilities. Despite its focus on  low-carbon  generation, Exelon believes its operations could be significantly affected by the possible physical risks of climate change and by mandatory programs to reduce
GHG emissions. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for information regarding the market and financial, regulatory and legislative, and operational risks associated with climate change.  
   Climate Change Regulation.   Exelon is or may become subject to climate change regulation or legislation at the Federal, regional and
state levels.     International Climate Change Regulation.  At the international level, the United States is a Party to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21 st  session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 21) on December 12,
2015. The Paris Agreement defines the UNFCCC s objective of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 C above  pre-industrial  levels. All Parties are required to develop their own national
emission reductions and to update those reductions at least every five years. The Developed Country Parties, including the United States, are required to take the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. The United
States had previously submitted its national emission reductions to achieve a 2020 target of reducing net emissions to 17% below the 2005 level and to achieve net greenhouse gas emission reductions of 26% 28% below the 2005 level by 2025. The
United States has indicated that it intends to achieve these reductions through a variety of mechanisms, including regulations to cut carbon pollution from new and existing power plants. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4,
2016 the thirtieth day after the date on which at  
      31  

Table of Contents  

least 55 Parties accounting for at least an estimated 55% of total global greenhouse gas emissions ratified the Agreement. The Agreement has not been ratified by the US Senate and it is uncertain
whether or not or to what extent the new Trump Administration will pursue the established target.     Federal Climate Change Legislation and
Regulation.  It is highly uncertain that Federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions will be enacted. If such legislation is adopted, Exelon may incur costs either to further limit or offset the GHG emissions from its operations or to
procure emission allowances or credits.    Under the Obama Administration, the EPA proposed and finalized regulations for new and modified fossil-fuel
power plants under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act and Section 111(d) for existing fossil-fuel power plants. These regulations are currently being litigated. The 111(d) regulations, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, are currently subject to a
stay by the Supreme Court, pending conclusion of all litigation at both the D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court levels. The D.C. Circuit heard  en banc  oral argument in late September 2016, but has not yet issued its decision. Prior to the stay,
the Clean Power Plan had established GHG emission reduction targets for each state, with emission reductions slated to begin in 2022. State requirements to submit plans to EPA in September 2016 (or within two years if an extension was requested)
were placed in abeyance pending results of litigation.    President Trump s election platform called for eliminating a number of EPA regulations,
including the Clean Power Plan. Due to the need to appoint and confirm key EPA officials as the Trump Administration begins to govern, the specific details of the Trump Administration s plans to address the Clean Power Plan are not known. In
the interim, the D.C. Circuit continues its review of the regulation under existing litigation and is expected to issue its decision in the first half of 2017.  
 Due to current litigation and the need for the new Administration to develop its approach to dealing with the Clean Power plan, Exelon and Generation
cannot at this time predict the future of the Clean Power Plan or individual state responses to Clean Power Plan developments or how developments will impact their future financial positions, results of operations and cash flows.  
  Regional and State Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.  After a  two-year  program review, the
nine northeast and  mid-Atlantic  states currently participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Initiative (RGGI) released an updated RGGI Model Rule and Program Review Recommendations Summary on
February 7, 2013. Under the updated RGGI program the regional RGGI CO 2  budget was reduced, starting in 2014, from its previous 165 million ton level to 91 million tons, with a
25 percent reduction in the cap level each year from 2015 through 2020. Included in the program are provisions for cost containment reserve (CCR) allowances, which will become available if the total demand for allowances, above the CCR trigger
price, exceeds the number of CO 2  allowances available for purchase at auction. (CCR trigger prices are $6 in 2015, $8 in 2016 and $10 in 2017; after 2017 the CCR price increases by
2.5 percent each year). Allowance prices in 2016 remained below the applicable CCR trigger price, indicating program costs remained within the boundaries of costs acceptable to participating states. During 2016, RGGI began its quadrennial
review process to determine what, if any, program design amendments should be pursued for the regional program. A series of stakeholder calls occurred in 2016, which included discussion around potential linkage issues with the federal Clean Power
Plan, linkages to state GHG emission reduction goals/programs, functioning of cost containment mechanisms, and consideration of whether future cap levels should be adjusted for the post-2020 period. RGGI intends to complete its program review in
early 2017.    On December 18, 2009, Pennsylvania issued the state s final Climate Change Action Plan. The plan sets as a target a
30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2020. The Climate Change Advisory Committee continues to meet quarterly to review Climate Action Work Plans for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The Climate Change Action Plan does not
impose any requirements on Generation or PECO at this time.

  The Maryland Commission on Climate Change was chartered in 2007 and released a greenhouse gas reduction
strategy with 42 recommendations on August 27, 2008. The plan s primary policy recommendation to formally adopt science-based regulatory goals to reduce Maryland s green house gas emissions (GHG) was realized with the passage of the
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act of 2009 (GGRA) which required Maryland to reduce its GHG emissions by 25 percent below 2006 levels by 2020. It also directed the Maryland Department of Environment to prepare and implement an action plan
which listed Maryland s electricity consumption reduction goals, required under the  EmPOWER Maryland  program, and mandatory State participation in RGGI Program, as the energy sector s contribution to the plan. In April 2016,
the Governor of Maryland signed the GGRA of 2016 into law, which updated the state s Climate Commission charter. It expanded membership to include more  non-governmental  members and established an enhanced
statewide GHG emissions reduction target of 40 percent from 2006 levels by 2030, maintaining the caveats from the 2007 legislation that the implementation have a net positive impact on both jobs and the economy. MDE is currently working on
plans to meet the 2016 GGRA requirements. In February of this year (2017) , the Maryland General Assembly overrode Maryland Governor Hogan s veto of legislation that requires the current Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to be accelerated and
enhanced. The law requires the RPS, previously set at 20% renewables by 2022, with a 2% solar carve out, to move to 25% renewables by 2020 with a 2.5% solar carve out.  
  Exelon s Voluntary Climate Change Efforts . In a world increasingly concerned about global climate change and regulatory action to reduce
GHG, Exelon s  low-carbon  generating fleet is seen by management as a competitive advantage. Exelon remains one of the largest, lowest carbon electric generators in the United States: nuclear for base
load, natural gas for marginal and peak demand, hydro and pumped storage, and supplemental wind and solar renewables. As further legislation and regulation imposing requirements on emissions of GHG and air pollutants are promulgated, Exelon s  low-carbon,   low-emission  generation fleet will position the company to benefit from its comparative advantage over other generation fleets.  
   Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards    
 Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted some form of RPS requirement. Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia,
Delaware and New Jersey have laws specifically addressing energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In addition to state level activity, RPS legislation has been considered and may be considered again in the future by the United States
Congress. Also, states that currently do not have RPS requirements may adopt such legislation in the future.    In Illinois, in accordance with
legislation in effect on December 31, 2016, the IPA s Procurement Plans include the procurement of cost-effective renewable energy resources in amounts that equal or exceed a minimum target percentage of the total electricity that each
electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers. The June 1, 2016 target renewable energy resources obligation for the utilities was at least 11.5%. This obligation increases by at least 1.5% each year thereafter to an ultimate
target of at least 25% by June 1, 2025. All goals are subject to rate impact criteria set forth by Illinois legislation. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd had purchased renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, in accordance
with the IPA Procurement Plan. ComEd currently retires all RECs upon transfer and acceptance. ComEd is permitted to recover procurement costs of RECs from retail customers without  mark-up  through rates.  
 In accordance with FEJA that takes effect on June 1, 2017, beginning with the plan or plans to be implemented in the 2017 delivery year, the IPA
shall develop a long term renewable resources procurement plan (LT Plan). The RPS target percentages for the overall service territory have not changed through June 1, 2025 (11.5% of retail load by June 1 2016 growing to 25% by
June 1 2025) although FEJA extended the 25% RPS target to delivery years after 2025. Currently, each Retail  
      33  

Table of Contents  

Electric Supplier and each utility is responsible for the renewable resource obligation for the customers to which it supplies power. Over time, this will change and the utility will procure
renewable resources based on the retail load of substantially all customers in its service territory. For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2017, the LT Plan shall include cost effective renewable energy resources procured by the utility for
the retail load the utility supplies and for 50% of the retail customer load supplied by Retail Electric Suppliers in the utility service territory on February 28, 2017. Utility procurement for RES supplied retail customer load will
increase to 75% June 1, 2018 and to 100% beginning June 1, 2019.    Originally passed November 30, 2004 the AEPS Act became effective
for PECO on January 1, 2011. During 2016, PECO was required to supply approximately 5.5% of electric energy generated from Tier I alternative energy resources (including solar, wind power,  low-impact 
hydropower, geothermal energy, biologically derived methane gas, fuel cells, biomass energy, coal mine methane and black liquor generated within Pennsylvania), as measured in AECs, through May 31, 2016 and subsequently 6.0% beginning
June 1, 2016 and continuing through May 31, 2017. PECO is also required to supply 8.2% of electric energy generated from Tier II alternative energy resources (including waste coal, demand-side management, large-scale hydropower, municipal
solid waste, generation of electricity utilizing wood and  by-products  of the pulping process and wood, distributed generation systems and integrated combined coal gasification technology), as measured in AECs,
effective June 1, 2015 and continuing through May 31, 2020. The compliance requirements will incrementally escalate to 8.0% for Tier I and 10.0% for Tier II by 2021. In order to comply with these requirements, PECO purchases its AECs
through its DSP Program full requirement contracts with various counterparties, including Generation. PECO also obtains AECs of Solar Tier I annually from long term agreements with various counterparties, including Generation, and balancing amounts
of Tier 1  non-solar  and Tier II through broker purchases.  
  Section 7-703  of the Public Utilities Article in Maryland sets forth the RPS requirement, which applies to
all retail electricity sales in Maryland by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it sells from Tier 1 sources (solar, wind, biomass, methane, geothermal, ocean, fuel
cell, small hydroelectric, and poultry litter) and Tier 2 sources (hydroelectric, other than pump storage generation, and   waste-to-energy). The   RPS requirement
began in 2006, requiring that suppliers procure 1.0% and 2.5% from Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources, respectively, escalating in 2022 to 22.0% from Tier 1 sources, including at least 2.0% from solar energy, and a phase out of Tier 2 resource options
by 2022. In 2015, 10.5% was required from Tier 1 renewable sources, including at least 0.5% derived from solar energy and 2.5% from Tier 2 renewable sources. BGE, Pepco and DPL are subject to requirements established by the Public
Utilities Article in Maryland related to the use of alternative energy resources. In addition, the wholesale suppliers that supply power to BGE, Pepco and DPL through SOS procurement auctions have the obligation, by contract with BGE, Pepco and DPL,
to meet the RPS requirements.    Section 34-1432 of the D.C. Code sets forth the RPS requirement, which applies to all retail electricity sales in the
District of Columbia by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it sells from Tier 1 sources (solar, wind, certain qualifying biomass, methane from anaerobia decomposition
of organic materials in landfill or wastewater treatment plant, geothermal, ocean, and fuel cell) and Tier 2 sources (hydroelectric (other than pumped storage generation), certain qualifying biomass and waste-to-energy). The RPS requirement began in
2007, with standards increasing annually. For 2017, the RPS requires that suppliers procure 13.1% and 2.5% from Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources, respectively, with not less than 0.95% solar, and escalating in 2023 to 20.0% from Tier 1 sources, including
at least 2.5% from solar energy, and a phase out of Tier 2 resource options. In 2015 the law was amended to extend the RPS requirements to 2032, at which time not less than 50% is required from Tier 1 renewable sources, including at least 5.0%
derived from solar energy. Tier 2 renewable sources remain phased out. The wholesale suppliers that supply power to Pepco through SOS procurement auctions have the obligation, by contract with Pepco, to meet the RPS requirements.

  Title 26 of the Delaware Code sets forth the RPS requirement, which applies to retail electricity sales in
Delaware by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that DPL obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it delivers to its eligible customers from eligible energy resources (solar electric, wind, ocean tidal, ocean thermal, fuel
cells powered by renewable fuels, hydroelectric facilities with a maximum capacity of 30 MW, sustainable biomass, anaerobic digestion and landfill gas). The RPS requirement, beginning in 2007, required that suppliers procure 2.0% from eligible
energy resources, with not less than 0.011% from solar, and escalating annually through 2025, at which time suppliers must procure 25.0% from eligible energy resources, including at least 3.5% from solar. As of December 31, 2016, DPL is a party to
three land-based wind power purchase agreements in the aggregate amount of 128 MWs (nameplate capacity). DPL has contracted for approximately 48 MW of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) through a combination of long term SREC purchase agreements
with solar facilities, SREC Purchase agreements with the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility and the DE SREC Procurement Program. On October 18, 2011, the DPSC approved a tariff submitted by DPL in accordance with the requirements of the RPS
specific to a fuel cell facility totaling 30 MWs to be constructed by a qualified fuel cell provider. The tariff and the RPS establish that DPL acts solely as an agent to collect payments in advance from its distribution customers and remit them to
the qualified fuel cell provider for each MWh of energy produced by the fuel cell facilities through 2033. The qualified fuel cell provider output reduces the non-solar and/or solar requirements needed to satisfy the Delaware RPS obligations.  
 The Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, ( EDECA ), was signed into law in 1999, and includes the requirement for compliance with New
Jersey s RPS by electric power suppliers and providers of BGS. The RPS requires that electric power suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity they sell from Class I sources (solar, wind, wave/tidal action, geothermal, methane
captured from landfills, fuel cells with certain types of power sources, and biomass) and Class II sources (hydroelectric facilities with a combined design capacity of less than 30 MW, and certain resource recovery facilities). In 2010, the Solar
Energy Advancement and Fair Competition Act, ( SEAFCA ), was signed into law. SEAFCA amended several provisions of EDECA, among them the manner in which suppliers were to comply with the solar portion of the RPS. SEAFCA, beginning in
energy year 2011, set out a specific requirement for solar energy generation. The Solar Act of 2012 made further changes effective for energy year 2014 and beyond. The RPS requirement has changed over time. For energy year 2005, suppliers were
required to procure 0.74% and 2.5% from Class I and Class II sources, respectively. For the most recently completed energy year 2016, 9.649% was required from Class I renewable sources, 2.5% from Class II renewable sources, and 2.75% from solar
energy. As noted above, the RPS applies to each supplier or provider that sells electricity to retail customers in New Jersey. Pursuant to Section 14:4-1.2 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, electric public utilities, such as ACE, that provide
electric generation services only for the purpose of providing BGS are not electric power suppliers and so are not subject to the RPS procurement requirements.  
 Similar to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE, Generation s retail electric business must source a portion of the electric load it serves in many
of the states in which it does business from renewable resources or approved equivalents such as RECs. Potential regulation and legislation regarding renewable and alternative energy resources could increase the pace of development of wind and other
renewable/alternative energy resources, which could put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity in some markets where Exelon operates generation assets. At the same time, such developments may present some opportunities for
sales of Generation s renewable power, including from wind, solar, hydroelectric and landfill gas.    See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on renewable portfolio standards.

ITEM 1A.  
  RISK FACTORS       Each of the Registrants operates in a market and regulatory environment that poses
significant risks, many of which are beyond that Registrant s control. Management of each Registrant regularly meets with the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer and the RMC, which comprises officers of the Registrants, to identify and evaluate the
most significant risks of the Registrants  businesses and the appropriate steps to manage and mitigate those risks. The Chief Enterprise Risk Officer and senior executives of the Registrants discuss those risks with the Finance and Risk
Committee and Audit Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors and the ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI boards of directors. In addition, the generation oversight committee of the Exelon board of directors evaluates risks related to the generation
business. The risk factors discussed below could adversely affect one or more of the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows and the market prices of their publicly traded securities. Each of the Registrants has disclosed the known
material risks that affect its business at this time. However, there may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by a Registrant to be material that could adversely affect its performance or
financial condition in the future.  
      41  

Table of Contents  

  Exelon s financial condition and results of operations are affected to a significant degree by:
(1) Generation s position as a predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive energy markets with a concentration in select regions, and (2) the role of the Utility Registrants as operators of electric transmission and
distribution systems in six of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Factors that affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Registrants fall primarily under the following categories, all of which are discussed in
further detail below:      

Market and Financial Factors.   Exelon s and Generation s results of operations are affected by price fluctuations in the energy markets. Power prices are a function of supply and demand, which in
turn are driven by factors such as (1) the price of fuels, in particular the price of natural gas, which affects the prices that Generation can obtain for the output of its power plants, (2) the presence of other generation resources in
the markets in which Generation s output is sold, (3) the demand for electricity in the markets where the Registrants conduct their business, and (4) the impacts of  on-going  competition in the
retail channel.        

Regulatory and Legislative Factors.   The regulatory and legislative factors that affect the Registrants include changes to the laws and regulations that govern competitive markets and utility cost recovery
and environmental policy. In particular, Exelon s and Generation s financial performance could be affected by changes in the design of competitive wholesale power markets or Generation s ability to sell power in those markets. In
addition, potential regulation and legislation, including regulation or legislation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standards, could have significant effects on the Registrants. Also, returns for the Utility Registrants are
influenced significantly by state regulation and regulatory proceedings.        

Operational Factors.   The Registrants  operational performance is subject to those factors inherent in running the nation s largest fleet of nuclear power reactors and large electric and gas
distribution systems. The safe and effective operation of the nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations as well as the ability to maintain the availability, reliability and safety of its
energy delivery systems are fundamental to Exelon s ability to protect and grow shareholder value. Additionally, the operating costs of the Utility Registrants and the opinions of their customers and regulators, are affected by those
companies  ability to maintain the reliability and safety of their energy delivery systems.        

Risks Related to the PHI Merger.  Exelon is subject to additional risks related to the merger with PHI that closed on March 23, 2016.    
 A discussion of each of these risk categories and other risk factors is included below.  
   Market and Financial Factors       Generation is exposed to depressed
prices in the wholesale and retail power markets, which could negatively affect its results of operations or cash flows. (Exelon and Generation)   
 Generation is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of its electricity generation supply portfolio. Generation s earnings
and cash flows are therefore subject to variability of spot and forward market prices in the markets in which it operates rise and fall.     Price
of Fuels : The spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. Thus, the market price of power is affected by the market
price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit. Often, the next unit of electricity will be supplied from generating stations fueled by fossil fuels. Consequently, changes in the market price of fossil fuels often result
in comparable changes to the market price of power. For example, the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits has increased natural gas supply and reserves, placing downward pressure on natural gas
 
      42  

Table of Contents  

prices and, therefore, on power prices. The continued addition of supply from new alternative generation resources, such as wind and solar, whether mandated through RPS or otherwise
subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation, could displace a higher marginal cost plant, further reducing power prices. In addition, further delay or elimination of EPA air quality regulations could prolong the duration for
which the cost of pollution from fossil fuel generation is not factored into market prices.     Demand and Supply:  The market price for
electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity. Unfavorable economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs could
each depress demand. The result is that higher-cost generating resources do not run as frequently, putting downward pressure on electricity market prices. The tepid economic environment in recent years and growing energy efficiency and
demand response initiatives have limited the demand for electricity in Generation s markets. In addition, in some markets, the supply of electricity through wind or solar generation, when combined with other base-load generation such as
nuclear, could often exceed demand during some hours of the day, resulting in loss of revenue for base-load generating plants. Increased supply in excess of demand is furthered by the continuation of RPS mandates and subsidies for renewable energy.
    Retail Competition:  Generation s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affects the margins that
Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. In periods of sustained low natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, retail competitors can aggressively pursue market share because the barriers to entry can be low
and wholesale generators (including Generation) use their retail operations to hedge generation output. Increased or more aggressive competition could adversely affect overall gross margins and profitability in Generation s retail
operations.    Sustained low market prices or depressed demand and over-supply could adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s results of
operations or cash flows, and such impacts could be emphasized given Generation s concentration of base-load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market regions, namely the Midwest and the
 Mid-Atlantic. These  impacts could adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s ability to fund other discretionary uses of cash such as growth projects or to pay dividends. In addition, such
conditions may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s result of operations through accelerated depreciation expense, impairment charges related to
inventory that cannot be used at other nuclear units and cancellation of  in-flight  capital projects, accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel costs, severance costs, accelerated asset retirement
obligation expense related to future decommissioning activities, and additional funding of decommissioning costs, which can be offset in whole or in part by reduced operating and maintenance expenses. A slow recovery in market conditions could
result in a prolonged depression of or further decline in commodity prices, including low forward natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, which could also adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s results of operations,
cash flows or financial position. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
  In addition to price fluctuations, Generation is exposed to other risks in the power markets that are beyond its control and could negatively affect its results of
operations. (Exelon and Generation)       Credit Risk.   In the bilateral markets, Generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties
that owe Generation money, or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from Generation, will not perform under their obligations for operational or financial reasons. In the event the counterparties to these
 
      43  

Table of Contents  

arrangements fail to perform, Generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, to the extent of
amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In the spot markets, Generation is exposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets, primarily RTOs and ISOs, the purpose of which is to spread such risk
across all market participants. Generation is also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties. In addition, Generation s retail sales subject it to credit
risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies, governmental entities and residential customers. Retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations.
This risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer.  
   Market Designs.   The wholesale markets vary from region to region with distinct rules, practices and procedures. Changes in these market
rules, problems with rule implementation, or failure of any of these markets could adversely affect Generation s business. In addition, a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect
on market stability.     The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry, including
technologies related to energy generation, distribution and consumption. (All Registrants)     Some of these technologies include, but are not
limited, to further shale gas development or sources, cost-effective renewable energy technologies, broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles, distributed generation and energy storage devices. Such developments could affect the price of
energy, could affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, could require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power
supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy. Each of these factors could
materially affect the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial position through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased operating and maintenance expenses, and increased capital expenditures, as well as
potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.     Market performance and
other factors could decrease the value of NDT funds and employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding. (All Registrants)   
 Disruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the
value of the investments held within Generation s NDTs and Exelon s employee benefit plan trusts. The Registrants have significant obligations in these areas and Exelon and Generation hold substantial assets in these trusts to meet those
obligations. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below the Registrants  projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the NDT fund investments could increase
Generation s funding requirements to decommission its nuclear plants. A decline in the market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets will increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon s pension and OPEB plan obligations.
Additionally, Exelon s pension and OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics,
including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of
 
      44  

Table of Contents  

the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans. If future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets or other factors cannot be recovered, or
cannot be recovered in a timely manner, from the Utility Registrants  customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Utility Registrants could be negatively affected. Ultimately, if the Registrants are unable to manage the
investments within the NDT funds and benefit plan assets, and are unable to manage the related benefit plan liabilities, their results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be negatively impacted.  
  Unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets could adversely affect the Registrants  businesses in several ways, including
the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements, the Registrants  ability to meet long-term commitments, Generation s ability to hedge effectively its generation portfolio, and the competitiveness and liquidity of
energy markets; each could negatively impact the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial position. (All Registrants)   
 The Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their
financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from the Registrants  respective operations. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad could adversely affect the
Registrants  ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The Registrants  access to funds under their credit facilities depends on the ability of the banks that are parties to the
facilities to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from
the Registrants and other borrowers within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased
regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, changes to Generation s hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral-posting requirements,
or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash.    In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets,
including Europe. Disruptions in the European markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants  ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 23%, or
$2.2 billion of the Registrants  available credit facilities were with European banks. The credit facilities include $9.5 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $7.9 billion was available as of December 31, 2016. As
of December 31, 2016, there was $75 million of borrowings under Generation s bilateral credit facilities. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the credit facilities.    The strength and depth of competition in energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple
trading parties, which could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and legislative and regulatory initiatives that could affect participants in commodities transactions. Reduced capital and liquidity and failures of
significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to the respective businesses of the Registrants. Perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength
of the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the requirement of long-term contracts, which could have a material
adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations or cash flows.

   If any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise
fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its counterparties, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral under its agreements with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing costs. (All Registrants)
    Generation s business is subject to credit quality standards that could require market participants to post collateral for their
obligations. If Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating) or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards of trading counterparties, it would be required under its
hedging arrangements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. The amount of collateral required to be provided by Generation at any point in time depends on a
variety of factors, including (1) the notional amount of the applicable hedge, (2) the nature of counterparty and related agreements, and (3) changes in power or other commodity prices. In addition, if Generation were downgraded, it
could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. Generation could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any of the credit rating agencies concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall
creditworthiness of the power generation industry in general, or Generation in particular, has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the credit rating agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of Generation. Generation
has project-specific financing arrangements and must meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings. Failure to meet those arrangements could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or
waived, could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to
foreclose against the project assets and related collateral.    The Utility Registrants  operating agreements with PJM and PECO s,
BGE s and DPL s natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and the Utility Registrants were to lose their
investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their liquidity. Collateral
posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO, BGE and DPL, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward
market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. Given the relationship to forward market prices, contract collateral requirements can be volatile. In addition, if the Utility Registrants were downgraded, they could experience higher
borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.    A Utility Registrant could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any of the credit rating agencies
concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility industry in general, or a Utility Registrant in particular, has deteriorated. A Utility Registrant could experience a downgrade if its current
regulatory environment becomes less predictable by materially lowering returns for the Utility Registrant or adopting other measures to limit utility rates. Additionally, the ratings for a Utility Registrant could be downgraded if its financial
results are weakened from current levels due to weaker operating performance or due to a failure to properly manage its capital structure. In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings
of the Utility Registrants.    The Utility Registrants conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements
and procedures intended to assure that the Utility Registrants are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate the Utility Registrants from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries
in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as  ring- 
      46  

Table of Contents  

fencing ) could help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing
measures, the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of some or all of
the Utility Registrants. A reduction in the credit rating of a Utility Registrant could have a material adverse effect on the Utility Registrant.  
 See Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Market Conditions and Security Ratings for further information regarding the potential impacts of credit
downgrades on the Registrants  cash flows.     Generation s financial performance could be negatively affected by price volatility, availability and other
risk factors associated with the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel. (Exelon and Generation)     Generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil
fuels to operate most of its generating facilities. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel
fabrication services. Natural gas and oil are procured for generating plants through annual, short-term and spot-market purchases. The supply markets for nuclear fuel, natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuations, availability restrictions
and counterparty default that could negatively affect the results of operations or cash flows for Generation.     Generation s risk management policies cannot
fully eliminate the risk associated with its commodity trading activities. (Exelon and Generation)     Generation s asset-based power position
as well as its power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity trading activities expose Generation to risks of commodity price movements. Generation attempts to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk
management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when its policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on
projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations could be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other
energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, Generation cannot predict the impact that its commodity trading activities and risk
management decisions could have on its business, operating results, cash flows or financial position.    Generation buys and sells energy and other
products and enters into financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various positions in Generation s power generation portfolio. Generation is exposed to volatility in financial results for unhedged positions.  
  Financial performance and load requirements could be adversely affected if Generation is unable to effectively manage its power portfolio. (Exelon and Generation)
    A significant portion of Generation s power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with the Utility Registrants and
other customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, Generation s output is sold in the wholesale power markets. To the extent its power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of its
customers under the related agreements, Generation must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Generation s financial results could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost-effectively meet the load requirements of its customers,
manage its power portfolio and effectively address the changes in the wholesale power markets.

   Challenges to tax positions taken by the Registrants as well as tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in
quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows. (All Registrants)   
   Potential Corporate Tax Reform.   The results of the November 2016 U.S. elections have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to federal
tax policies. President Trump has stated that one of his top priorities is comprehensive tax reform and House Republicans plan to advance their tax reform  blueprint . Tax reform proposals call for a reduction in the corporate
federal income tax rate from the current 35% to as low as 15%. Other proposals provide, among other items, for the immediate deduction of capital investment expenditures and full or partial elimination of debt interest expense
deductions. It is uncertain whether, to what extent or when these or any other changes in federal tax policies will be enacted or the transition time frame for such changes. Further, for the Utility Registrants, regulators may impose rate
reductions to provide the benefit of any income tax expense reductions to customers and refund  excess  deferred income taxes previously collected through rates. The amounts and timing of any such rate changes would be subject to the
discretion of the rate regulator in each specific jurisdiction. For these reasons, the Registrants cannot predict the impact any potential changes may have on their future results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and such
changes could be material.      Tax reserves.   The Registrants are required to make judgments in order to estimate their obligations to
taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these tax matters. These judgments include reserves established for potential adverse outcomes
regarding tax positions that have been taken that could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. See Notes 1 Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.     Increases in customer rates and the impact of economic downturns could lead to greater expense for uncollectible customer balances.
Additionally, increased rates could lead to decreased volumes delivered. Both of these factors could decrease Generation s and the Utility Registrants  results from operations or cash flows. (All Registrants)   
 The Utility Registrants  current procurement plans include purchasing power through contracted suppliers and in the spot market. ComEd s,
PECO s and ACE s costs of purchased power are charged to customers without a return or profit component. BGE s, Pepco s and DPL s SOS rates charged to customers recover their wholesale power supply costs and include a return
component. For PECO, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers with no return or profit component. For BGE, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers using a MBR mechanism that compares the actual cost of gas to a market index.
The difference between the actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers. For DPL, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers using a GCR mechanism that compares the actual cost of gas to a
forecasted amount. The difference between the actual cost and the forecast is fully recoverable and carried forward as a recovery balance in the next GCR filing. Purchased power and natural gas prices fluctuate based on their relevant supply and
demand. Significantly higher rates related to purchased power and natural gas could result in declines in customer usage, lower revenues and potentially additional uncollectible accounts expense for the Utility Registrants. In addition, any
challenges by the regulators or the Utility Registrants as to the recoverability of these costs could have a material effect on the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows. Also, the Utility Registrants  cash flows could be
affected by differences between the time period when electricity and natural gas are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers.    Further,
the impacts of economic downturns on the Utility Registrants  customers, such as unemployment for residential customers and less demand for products and services provided by  
      48  

Table of Contents  

commercial and industrial customers, and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations, could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer
balances , which would negatively impact the Utility Registrants  results of operations or cash flows. Generation s customer-facing energy delivery activities face similar economic downturn risks, such as lower volumes sold and
increased expense for uncollectible customer balances which could negatively affect Generation s results of operations or cash flows. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for further discussion of the
Registrants  credit risk.     The effects of weather could impact the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows. (All Registrants)   
 Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Temperatures above normal
levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect
the usage of energy and resulting revenues at ComEd, PECO, DPL and ACE. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE, Pepco and DPL recognize revenues at MDPSC and DCPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what actual distribution volumes are for a
billing period, and are not affected by actual weather with the exception of major storms. Pursuant to the Illinois FEJA signed into law on December 2016 and effective in 2017, ComEd can eliminate the favorable or unfavorable impacts of weather or
load on its electric distribution revenues by either (1) revising its electric distribution formula rate to eliminate the ROE collar beginning with the reconciliation performed for the 2017 calendar year or (2) implementing a decoupling
tariff if the electric distribution formula rate were to be terminated at anytime.    Extreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could
stress the Utility Registrants  transmission and distribution systems, communication systems and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company s ability to meet peak customer demand. These
extreme conditions could have detrimental effects on the Utility Registrants  results of operations or cash flows. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make
period comparisons less relevant.    Generation s operations are also affected by weather, which affects demand for electricity as well as
operating conditions. To the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed, Generation could require greater resources to meet its contractual commitments. Extreme weather conditions or storms could affect the
availability of generation and its transmission, limiting Generation s ability to source or send power to where it is sold. In addition, drought-like conditions limiting water usage could impact Generation s ability to run certain
generating assets at full capacity. These conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, could have an adverse effect by causing Generation to seek additional capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity
at a time when markets are weak.     Certain long-lived assets and other assets recorded on the Registrants  statements of financial position could become
impaired, which would result in write-offs of the impaired amounts. (All Registrants)     Long-lived assets represent the single largest asset class
on the Registrants  statements of financial position. Specifically, long-lived assets account for 62%, 54%, 68%, 70%, 81%, 76%, 79% and 73% of total assets for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively, as of
December 31, 2016. In addition, Exelon and Generation have significant balances related to unamortized energy contracts, as further disclosed in Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Registrants evaluate the recoverability of  
      49  

Table of Contents  

the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as the business climate, including current and
future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment. An impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the
long-lived asset to fair value through a  non-cash  charge to expense by the amount of the impairment, and such an impairment could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants  results of operations.
   As of December 31, 2016, Exelon s $6.7 billion carrying amount of goodwill primarily consists of $2.6 billion at ComEd relating
to the acquisition of ComEd in 2000 upon the formation of Exelon and $4.0 billion at PHI primarily resulting from Exelon s acquisition of PHI in the first quarter of 2016. Under GAAP, goodwill remains at its recorded amount unless it is
determined to be impaired, which is generally based upon an annual analysis that compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the amount of the impaired goodwill will be  written-off  to expense, which will also reduce equity. The actual timing and amounts of any goodwill impairments will depend on many sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables. Such an impairment would result
in a  non-cash  charge to expense, which could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s, ComEd s, and PHI s results of operations.  
 Regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions,
projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd s, Pepco s, DPL s, and ACE s business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon s, PHI s, and ComEd s goodwill, which
could be material.    See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates and Note 7 Property, Plant and Equipment, Note 8 Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on
long-lived asset and goodwill impairments.     Exelon and its subsidiaries at times guarantee the performance of third parties, which could result in substantial
costs in the event of  non-performance  by such third parties. In addition, the Registrants could have rights under agreements which obligate third parties to indemnify the Registrants for various obligations,
and the Registrants could incur substantial costs in the event that the applicable Registrant is unable to enforce those agreements or the applicable third-party is otherwise unable to perform. The Registrants could also incur substantial costs in
the event that third parties are entitled to indemnification related to environmental or other risks in connection with the acquisition and divestiture of assets. (All Registrants)   
 Some of the Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate the Registrant or its subsidiaries to perform in the
event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of  non-performance  by those third parties, a Registrant could incur substantial cost to fulfill its obligations under these guarantees. Such
performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrant. Some of the Registrants have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in
connection with purchases and sales of asset and a Registrant could incur substantial costs to fulfill its obligations under these indemnities.  
 Some of the Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it
harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected
 
      50  

Table of Contents  

Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations, which could impact that Registrant s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In connection with Exelon s 2001
corporate restructuring, Generation assumed certain of ComEd s and PECO s rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. Further, ComEd and PECO may have entered into agreements with third parties under which
the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd or PECO for certain obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by Generation as part of the restructuring. If the third-party or Generation experienced events
that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, ComEd or PECO could be liable for any existing or future claims, which could impact ComEd s or PECO s results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.      Regulatory and Legislative Factors       The
Registrants  generation and energy delivery businesses are highly regulated and could be subject to regulatory and legislative actions that adversely affect their operations or financial results. Fundamental changes in regulation or legislation
or violation of tariffs or market rules and anti-manipulation laws, could disrupt the Registrants  business plans and adversely affect their operations or financial results. (All Registrants)   
 Substantially all aspects of the businesses of the Registrants are subject to comprehensive Federal or state regulation and legislation. Further,
Exelon s and Generation s operating results and cash flows are significantly affected by Generation s sale of power at market-based rates, as opposed to cost-based or other similarly regulated rates, and Exelon s and the Utility
Registrants  operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power to their customers. Similarly, there is risk that financial
market regulations could increase the Registrants  compliance costs and limit their ability to engage in certain transactions. In the planning and management of operations, the Registrants must address the effects of regulation on their
businesses and changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by Federal and state legislatures, RTOs, exchanges, ratemaking agencies and taxing authorities. Additionally, the Registrants need to be cognizant and understand rule changes
or Registrant actions that could result in potential violation of tariffs, market rules and anti-manipulation laws. Fundamental changes in regulations or other adverse legislative actions affecting the Registrants  businesses would require
changes in their business planning models and operations and could negatively impact their respective results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  
 Regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change and RPS could also significantly affect Exelon s and Generation s results of
operations, cash flows or financial position. Various legislative and regulatory proposals to address climate change through GHG emission reductions, if enacted, could result in increased costs to entities that generate electricity through
carbon-emitting fossil fuels, which could increase the market price at which all generators in a region, including Generation, could sell their output, thereby increasing the revenue Generation could realize from its
 low-carbon  nuclear assets. However, national regulation or legislation addressing climate change through an RPS could also increase the pace of development of wind energy facilities in the Midwest, which could
put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity from Generation s Midwest nuclear assets, partially offsetting any additional value Exelon and Generation might derive from Generation s nuclear assets under a carbon
constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future. Similarly, final regulations under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act may not provide sufficient incentives for states to utilize carbon-free nuclear power as a means of meeting
greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements, while continuing a policy of favoring renewable energy sources. Current state level climate change and renewable regulation is already providing incentives for regional wind development. The
Registrants cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals could become law or what their effect will be on the Registrants.  
      51  

Table of Contents  

   Generation could be negatively affected by possible Federal or state legislative or regulatory actions that could affect
the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets. (Exelon and Generation)     Federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are facing
pressures to address consumer concerns, or are themselves raising concerns, that energy prices in wholesale markets are too high or insufficient generation is being built because the competitive model is not working and, therefore, are considering
some form of  re-regulation  or some other means of reducing wholesale market prices or subsidizing new generation. Generation is dependent on robust and competitive wholesale energy markets to achieve its
business objectives.    Approximately 65% of Generation s generating resources, which include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through
long-term contracts, are located in the area encompassed by PJM. Generation s future results of operations will depend on (1) FERC s continued adherence to and support for, policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale
power markets, such as PJM s, and (2) the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect market competitiveness. Generation could also be adversely affected by state laws, regulations or
initiatives designed to reduce wholesale prices artificially below competitive levels or to subsidize new generation, such as the subsequently dismissed New Jersey Capacity Legislation and the MDPSC s RFP for new
 gas-fired  generation in Maryland. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the New Jersey Capacity Legislation and the
Maryland new electric generation requirements.    In addition, FERC s application of its Order 697 and its subsequent revisions could pose a risk
that Generation will have difficulty satisfying FERC s tests for market-based rates. Since Order 697 became final in June 2007, Generation has obtained orders affirming Generation s authority to sell at market-based rates and none denying
that authority.    The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was enacted in July 2010. The part of the Act that applies
to Exelon is Title VII, which is known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act (Dodd-Frank). Dodd-Frank requires the creation of a new regulatory regime for
  over-the-counter   swaps (swaps), including mandatory clearing for certain categories of swaps, incentives to shift swap activity to exchange trading, margin and capital
requirements, and other obligations designed to promote transparency. For non security-based swaps including commodity swaps, Dodd-Frank empowers the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to promulgate regulations implementing the law s
objectives. The primary aim of Dodd-Frank is to regulate the key intermediaries in the swaps market, which entities are either swap dealers (SDs), major swap participants (MSPs), and certain other financial entities, but the law also applies to a
lesser degree to  end-users  of swaps. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law a bill that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by  end-users  to
hedge or mitigate commercial risk. Moreover, the CFTC s Dodd-Frank regulations preserve the ability of end users in the energy industry to hedge their risks using swaps without being subject to mandatory clearing, and accepts or exempts  end-users  from many of the other substantive regulations. Accordingly, as an  end-user,  Generation is conducting its commercial business in a manner that does not require
registration with the CFTC as an SD or MSP. Generation does not anticipate transacting in the future in a manner in which it would become a SD or MSP.  
 There are, however, some rulemaking proceedings that have not yet been finalized, including the capital and margin rules for  (non-cleared)  swaps. Generation does not expect these rules to directly impact its collateral requirements. However, depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory
requirements still under development and that are similar to Dodd-Frank, Generation s swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant  
      52  

Table of Contents  

capitalization requirements. These regulations could motivate the SDs and MSPs to increase collateral requirements or cash postings from their counterparties, including Generation.  
 Generation continues to monitor the rulemaking proceedings with respect to the capital and margin rules, but cannot predict to what extent, if any,
further refinements to Dodd-Frank requirements could impact its cash flows or financial position, but such impacts could be material.    The Utility
Registrants could also be subject to some Dodd-Frank requirements to the extent they were to enter into swaps. However, at this time, management of the Utility Registrants continue to expect that their companies will not be materially affected by
Dodd-Frank.     Generation s affiliation with the Utility Registrants, together with the presence of a substantial percentage of Generation s physical
asset base within the Utility Registrants  service territories, could increase Generation s cost of doing business to the extent future complaints or challenges regarding the Utility Registrants  retail rates result in settlements or
legislative or regulatory requirements funded in part by Generation. (Exelon and Generation)     Generation has significant generating resources
within the service areas of the Utility Registrants and makes significant sales to each of them. Those facts tend to cause Generation to be directly affected by developments in those markets. Government officials, legislators and advocacy groups are
aware of Generation s affiliation with the Utility Registrants and its sales to each of them. In periods of rising utility rates, particularly when driven by increased costs of energy production and supply, those officials and advocacy groups
could question or challenge costs and transactions incurred by the Utility Registrants with Generation, irrespective of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. The prospect of such challenges could increase the
time, complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceedings, and the occurrence of such challenges could subject Generation to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets. In addition, government officials
and legislators could seek ways to force Generation to contribute to efforts to mitigate potential or actual rate increases, through measures such as generation-based taxes and contributions to rate-relief packages.  
  The Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. (All Registrants)   
 The businesses which the Registrants operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state and Federal authorities.
These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they handle air and water emissions and solid waste disposal. Violations of these emission and disposal
requirements could subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and  clean-up  costs, civil
penalties and exposure to third parties  claims for alleged health or property damages or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for
environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Registrants have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental
compliance, site remediation and  clean-up.  Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved
in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future.  
 If application of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, which establishes a national requirement for reducing the adverse impacts to aquatic
organisms at existing generating stations, requires the  
      53  

Table of Contents  

retrofitting of cooling water intake structures at Salem or other Exelon power plants, this development could result in material costs of compliance. Pursuant to discussions with the NJDEP
regarding the application of Section 316(b) to Oyster Creek, Generation agreed to permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019, ten years before the expiration of its operating license in 2029. On
July 28, 2016, the NJDEP issued a final permit for Salem that did not require the installation of cooling towers. However, the permit is being challenged by an environmental organization, and if successful, could result in additional costs for
Clean Water Act compliance.    Additionally, Generation is subject to exposure for asbestos-related personal injury liability alleged at certain
current and formerly owned generation facilities. Future legislative action could require Generation to make a material contribution to a fund to settle lawsuits for alleged asbestos-related disease and exposure.  
 In some cases, a third-party who has acquired assets from a Registrant has assumed the liability the Registrant could otherwise have for environmental
matters related to the transferred property. If the transferee is unable, or fails, to discharge the assumed liability, a regulatory authority or injured person could attempt to hold the Registrant responsible, and the Registrant s remedies
against the transferee could be limited by the financial resources of the transferee. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
  Changes in the Utility Registrants  respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings
and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which could introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes. (Exelon and the Utility Registrants)
    The Utility Registrants are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates
for their respective services. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective
of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. The proceedings generally have timelines that may not be limited by statute. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings.
The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for a Utility Registrant to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates
are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, bad debt, MGP remediation, smart
grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.    In certain instances, the Utility Registrants could agree to negotiated
settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval.  
 The Utility Registrants cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of
Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey or Federal regulators in establishing rates, including the extent, if any, to which certain costs such as significant capital projects will be recovered or what rates of return will be allowed. Nevertheless, the
expectation is that the Utility Registrants will continue to be obligated to deliver electricity to customers in their respective service territories and will also retain significant default service obligations, referred to as POLR, DSP, SOS, and
BGS, to provide electricity and natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose an alternative supplier. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory  
      54  

Table of Contents  

rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of the Utility Registrants, as applicable, to recover their costs and could have a material adverse effect on the Utility
Registrants  results of operations, cash flows and financial position. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding rate proceedings.  
  Federal or additional state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers, could negatively affect the results of
operations or cash flows of Generation and the Utility Registrants. (All Registrants)     Changes to current state legislation or the development of
Federal legislation that requires the use of renewable and alternate fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, could significantly impact Generation and the Utility Registrants, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed for
Utility Registrants. The impact could include increased costs for RECs and purchased power and increased rates for customers.    Federal and state
legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, have increased capital expenditures and could significantly impact the Utility
Registrants if timely cost recovery is not allowed. Furthermore, regulated energy consumption reduction targets and declines in customer energy consumption resulting from the implementation of new energy conservation technologies could lead to a
decline in the revenues of Exelon, Generation and the Utility Registrants. For additional information, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Environmental Regulation-Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards.   
  The impact of not meeting the criteria of the FASB guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation could be material to Exelon and the Utility
Registrants. (Exelon and the Utility Registrants)     As of December 31, 2016, Exelon and the Utility Registrants have concluded that the
operations of the Utility Registrants meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of their businesses no longer meets
the criteria, Exelon, and the Utility Registrants would be required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of their business. That action would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities
that had been recorded in their Consolidated Balance Sheets and the recognition of a  one-time  charge in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The impact of not meeting the
criteria of the authoritative guidance could be material to the financial statements of Exelon and the Utility Registrants. At December 31, 2016, the gain (loss) could have been as much as $2.5 billion, $(1.1) billion, $(552) million,
$(821) million, $(208) million and $(476) million (before taxes) as a result of the elimination of regulatory assets and liabilities of ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively. Further, Exelon would record a charge against OCI (before
taxes) of up to $2.6 billion, $614 million, $424 million, $243 million, and $84 million for ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE respectively, related to Exelon s net regulatory assets associated with its defined benefit
postretirement plans. Exelon also has a net regulatory liability of $47 million (before taxes) associated with PECO s defined benefit postretirement plans that would result in an increase in OCI if reversed. The impacts and resolution of
the above items could lead to an impairment of ComEd s or PHI s goodwill, which could be significant and at least partially offset the gains at ComEd discussed above. A significant decrease in equity as a result of any changes could limit
the ability of the Utility Registrants to pay dividends under Federal and state law and no longer meeting the regulatory accounting criteria could cause significant volatility in future results of operations. See Notes 1 Significant Accounting
Policies, 3 Regulatory Matters and 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding accounting for the effects of regulation, regulatory matters and ComEd s and
PHI s goodwill, respectively.

   Exelon and Generation could incur material costs of compliance if Federal and/or state regulation or legislation is
adopted to address climate change. (Exelon and Generation)     Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and  non-governmental  organizations, as well as other companies in many business sectors, including utilities, are considering ways to address the effect of GHG emissions on climate change. In 2009, select Northeast and  Mid-Atlantic  states implemented a model rule, developed via the RGGI, to regulate CO2 emissions from fossil-fired generation. RGGI states are working on updated programs to further limit emissions, and the EPA has
introduced regulation to address greenhouse gases from new fossil plants that could potentially impact existing plants. If carbon reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective, Exelon and Generation could incur costs either to limit further
the GHG emissions from their operations or to procure emission allowance credits. For example, more stringent permitting requirements could preclude the construction of lower-carbon nuclear and  gas-fired  power
plants. Similarly, a Federal RPS could increase the cost of compliance by mandating the purchase or construction of more expensive supply alternatives. For more information regarding climate change, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Global Climate
Change  and Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     The Registrants could be subject to
higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of the Utility Registrants to the results of PJM s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements. (All Registrants)   
 As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, users, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including Generation and the Utility
Registrants, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. As operators of natural gas distribution systems, PECO, BGE, and DPL are also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of
Transportation. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability
standards could subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC and NJBPU impose certain distribution reliability standards on the Utility Registrants. If the
Registrants were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.  
 The Utility Registrants as transmission owners are subject to NERC compliance requirements. NERC provides guidance to transmission owners regarding
assessments of transmission lines. The results of these assessments could require the Utility Registrants to incur incremental capital or operating and maintenance expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet NERC standards.  
 See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.     The Registrants could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception
and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences. (All Registrants)     The Registrants have large consumer customer bases and
as a result could be the subject of public criticism focused on the operability of their assets and infrastructure and quality of their service. Adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service
commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view energy companies such as Exelon and its subsidiaries in a favorable light, and could cause Exelon and its  
      56  

Table of Contents  

subsidiaries to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent regulatory requirements. Unfavorable regulatory
outcomes can include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing Exelon s operations, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative
impact on the Registrants  business, results of operations, cash flows and financial positions.     The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of the legal
proceedings relating to their business activities. An adverse determination could negatively impact their results of operations, cash flows or financial position. (All Registrants)   
 The Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of their business operations, the most significant of which are
summarized in Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on the
Registrants  results of operations.     Generation could be negatively affected by possible Nuclear Regulatory Commission actions that could affect the
operations and profitability of its nuclear generating fleet. (Exelon and Generation)       Regulatory risk   .  A change in the
Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and significantly affect Generation s results of operations
or financial position. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation, could cause the NRC to initiate such actions.  
   Spent nuclear fuel storage.   The approval of a national repository for the storage of SNF, such as the one previously considered at Yucca
Mountain, Nevada, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of SNF, and the ultimate amounts received from the DOE to reimburse Generation for these costs. The NRC s temporary storage
rule (also referred to as the  waste confidence decision ) recognizes that licensees can safely store SNF at nuclear power plants for up to 60 years beyond the original and renewed licensed operating life of the plants.  
 Any regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for SNF could adversely affect Generation s ability to decommission
fully its nuclear units. Through May 15, 2014, in accordance with the NWPA and Generation s contract with the DOE, Generation paid the DOE a fee per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. This fee was discontinued
effective May 16, 2014. Until such time as a new fee structure is in effect, Exelon and Generation will not accrue any further costs related to SNF disposal fees. Generation currently estimates 2030 to be the earliest date when the DOE will
begin accepting SNF, which could be delayed by further regulatory action. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the SNF obligation. Generation
cannot predict what, if any, fee will be established in the future for SNF disposal. However, such a fee could be material to Generation s results of operations or cash flows.

    Operational Factors    
  The Registrants  employees, contractors, customers and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry. (All
Registrants)     Employees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to,
potentially dangerous environments near their operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers and the general public are at some risk for serious injury, including loss of life. These risks include nuclear accidents, dam
failure, gas explosions, pole strikes and electric contact cases.     Natural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic and other significant events
could negatively impact the Registrants  results of operations, their ability to raise capital and their future growth. (All Registrants)   
 Generation s fleet of power plants and the Utility Registrants  distribution and transmission infrastructures could be affected by natural
disasters, such as seismic activity, extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, sea level rise and other related phenomena. Severe weather or other natural disasters
could be destructive, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Registrants  service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers
due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment.    Natural disasters and other significant events increase the risk to
Generation that the NRC or other regulatory or legislative bodies could change the laws or regulations governing, among other things, operations, maintenance, licensed lives, decommissioning, SNF storage, insurance, emergency planning, security and
environmental and radiological matters. In addition, natural disasters could affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for Generation s continued operation, particularly the cooling
of generating units. Additionally, natural disasters and other events that have an adverse effect on the economy in general could adversely affect the Registrants  operations and their ability to raise capital.  
 The impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry in general and on Exelon in particular is uncertain. As owner-operators of
infrastructure facilities, such as nuclear, fossil and hydroelectric generation facilities and electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities, the Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect
casualties of an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign could affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil.
Furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cyber security of Exelon s facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon s ability to manage its business effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a
result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors also could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect the Registrants  results of operations and its ability to raise
capital. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.  
 The Registrants could be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on
the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate Exelon s generating and transmission and distribution assets could be affected, resulting in decreased service levels and
increased costs.  
      58  

Table of Contents  

  In addition, Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against
property and casualty losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such
property and casualty losses.     Generation s financial performance could be negatively affected by matters arising from its ownership and operation of
nuclear facilities. (Exelon and Generation)       Nuclear capacity factors.   Capacity factors for generating units, particularly
capacity factors for nuclear generating units, significantly affect Generation s results of operations. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs but produce electricity at low variable costs due to nuclear fuel costs
typically being lower than fossil fuel costs. Consequently, to be successful, Generation must consistently operate its nuclear facilities at high capacity factors. Lower capacity factors increase Generation s operating costs by requiring
Generation to produce additional energy from primarily its fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy Generation s obligations to committed third-party sales, including the Utility
Registrants. These sources generally have higher costs than Generation incurs to produce energy from its nuclear stations.      Nuclear refueling
outages.   In general, refueling outages are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. The total number of refueling outages, along with their duration, could have a significant impact on Generation s results of operations. When
refueling outages last longer than anticipated or Generation experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and Generation faces lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs and/or lower energy sales.  
   Nuclear fuel quality   .  The quality of nuclear fuel utilized by Generation could affect the efficiency and costs of
Generation s operations. Certain of Generation s nuclear units have previously had a limited number of fuel performance issues. Remediation actions could result in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization, increased outage
costs and/or increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities.      Operational risk   .  Operations at any of
Generation s nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where Generation has to shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes could require significant time
and expense. Generation could choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. In either event, Generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet
supply commitments. For plants operated but not wholly owned by Generation, Generation could also incur liability to the  co-owners.  For plants not operated and not wholly owned by Generation, from which
Generation receives a portion of the plants  output, Generation s results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at those plants. Additionally,
poor operating performance at nuclear plants not owned by Generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy, which could significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial
position. In addition, closure of generating plants owned by others, or extended interruptions of generating plants or failure of transmission lines, could affect transmission systems that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity
in markets served by Generation.      Nuclear major incident risk.   Although the safety record of nuclear reactors generally has been very
good, accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the United States and abroad. The consequences of a major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage. Any resulting liability from a nuclear plant major
incident within the United States, owned or operated by Generation or owned by others, could exceed Generation s resources, including insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from insurers or the
 
      59  

Table of Contents  

nuclear industry, could be borne by Generation and could have a material adverse effect on Generation s results of operations or financial position. Additionally, an accident or other
significant event at a nuclear plant within the United States or abroad, whether owned Generation or others, could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy and significantly affect Generation s results
of operations or financial position.      Nuclear insurance.   As required by the Price-Anderson Act, Generation carries the maximum
available amount of nuclear liability insurance. The required amount of nuclear liability insurance is $450 million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection
pool. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the $13.4 billion limit for a single incident.  
 Generation is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, NEIL, which provides property and business interruption insurance for Generation s
nuclear operations. In previous years, NEIL has made distributions to its members but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will occur at all. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of nuclear insurance.      Decommissioning.   NRC regulations require that
licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. Generation is required to provide to the NRC a
biennial report by unit (annually for units that have been retired and units that are within five years of retirement) addressing Generation s ability to meet the  NRC-estimated  funding levels including
scheduled contributions to and earnings on the decommissioning trust funds. The NRC funding levels are based upon the assumption that decommissioning will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit.  
 Forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results could
differ significantly from current estimates. The performance of capital markets also could significantly affect the value of the trust funds. Currently, Generation is making contributions to certain trust funds of the former PECO units based on
amounts being collected by PECO from its customers and remitted to Generation. While Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers (subject to certain limitations and thresholds), it has no recourse to
collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of its other nuclear units if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning. If circumstances changed such that Generation would be unable to continue to make contributions to
the trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts collected from PECO customers, or if Generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers if there was a shortfall of funds for decommissioning, the adequacy of
the trust funds related to the former PECO units could be negatively affected and Exelon s and Generation s results of operations or financial position could be significantly affected. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.    Ultimately, if the investments held by Generation s NDTs are not
sufficient to fund the decommissioning of Generation s nuclear units, Generation could be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions
to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Generation s cash flows or financial position could be significantly
adversely affected. Additionally, if the pledged assets are not sufficient to fund the Zion station decommissioning activities under the Asset Sale Agreement (ASA), Generation could have to seek remedies available under the ASA to reduce the risk of
default by ZionSolutions and its parent. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
      60  

Table of Contents  

  For nuclear units that are subject to regulatory agreements with either the ICC or the PAPUC,
decommissioning-related activities are generally offset within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of
Operations and Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at Exelon. Likewise, ComEd and PECO have recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate
receivable from Generation and a corresponding regulatory liability.    In the case of the nuclear units subject to the regulatory agreements with the
ICC, if the funds held in the NDT funds for any former ComEd unit are expected to not exceed the total decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
and Comprehensive Income for that unit would be discontinued, the decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and the adverse impact to Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations and financial position could be material. Additionally, any remaining balances in noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and ComEd s noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and
corresponding regulatory liability may need to be reversed and could have a material impact on Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
 In the case of the nuclear units subject to the regulatory agreements with the PAPUC, any changes to the PECO regulatory agreements could impact
Exelon s and Generation s ability to offset decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the impact to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and
financial position could be material. Additionally, any remaining balances in noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and PECO s noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and corresponding regulatory liability may need to be
reversed and could have a material impact on Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.     Generation s financial
performance could be negatively affected by risks arising from its ownership and operation of hydroelectric facilities. (Exelon and Generation)   
 FERC has the exclusive authority to license most  non-Federal  hydropower projects located on navigable waterways,
Federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid. The license for the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Project expires on December 1, 2055. The license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project expired September 1, 2014. FERC issued an annual
license, effective as of the expiration of the previous license. If FERC does not issue a license prior to the expiration of the annual license, the annual license will renew automatically. Generation cannot predict whether it will receive all the
regulatory approvals for the renewed licenses of its hydroelectric facilities. If FERC does not issue new operating licenses for Generation s hydroelectric facilities or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license,
Generation s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license
renewal will be received. Generation could also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, conditions could be imposed as part of the license renewal process that could adversely affect
operations, could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating costs and significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial position. Similar effects could result from a change
in the Federal Power Act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation.

   The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to
maintain and are subject to operational failure, which could result in potential liability. (All Registrants)     The Registrants  businesses
are capital intensive and require significant investments by Generation in electric generating facilities and by the Utility Registrants in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. These operational systems and infrastructure have been
in service for many years. Equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants  control, and could require significant expenditures to
operate efficiently. The Registrants  respective results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be adversely affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital. Furthermore,
operational failure of electric or gas systems or infrastructure could result in potential liability if such failure results in damage to property or injury to individuals. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS for further information regarding the Registrants 
potential future capital expenditures.     The Utility Registrants  operating costs, and customers  and regulators  opinions of the Utility
Registrants are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems. (Exelon and the Utility Registrants)   
 Failures of the equipment or facilities, including information systems, used in the Utility Registrants  delivery systems could interrupt the
electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could negatively impact related revenues, and increase maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including weather or
information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure, smart grid or other technologies in the Utility Registrants  service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated
with billing and other information systems, the Utility Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail
or have other significant shortcomings, the Utility Registrants  financial results could be negatively impacted. If an employee causes the operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or
manipulating the operational systems, the Utility Registrants  financial results could also be negatively impacted. In addition, dependence upon automated systems could further increase the risk that operational system flaws or employee
tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.    The aforementioned failures or those of other
utilities, including prolonged or repeated failures, could affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight and the Utility Registrants  maintenance and capital expenditures. Regulated utilities, which are required to provide
service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd could be required to pay damages to its
customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, and those damages could be material to ComEd s results of operations or cash flows. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding proceedings related to storm-related outages in ComEd s service territory.  
  The Utility Registrants  respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by
transmission congestion and failures of neighboring transmission systems. (All Registrants)     Demand for electricity within the Utility
Registrants  service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage with consequent  
      62  

Table of Contents  

effects on operating costs, revenues and results of operations. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the Utility Registrants  ability
to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring the Utility
Registrant s to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.    The electricity transmission
facilities of the Utility Registrants are interconnected with the transmission facilities of neighboring utilities and are part of the interstate power transmission grid that is operated by PJM RTO. Although PJM s systems and operations are
designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities, there can be no assurance that service interruptions at other
utilities will not cause interruptions in the Utility Registrants  service areas. If the Utility Registrants were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on their and Exelon s results of operations, cash
flows and financial position.     The Registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks. (All Registrants)   
 The Registrants face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and distribution facilities and as
participants in commodities trading. Threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas utility industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information, grid infrastructure and
other energy infrastructures, and such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. Continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increase the potentially unfavorable impacts of
such attacks. A security breach of the physical assets or information systems of the Registrants, their competitors, interconnected entities in RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the
transmission and distribution system or subject the Registrants to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, sensitive customer, vendor and employee
data, trading or other confidential data. The risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, and while we have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to physical and cyber-attacks, to date we
have not experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations. However, as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency, the Registrants may be unable to prevent all such
attacks in the future. If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of Exelon and its customer supply activities could be adversely affected, customer confidence in the Registrants or others in the industry could be diminished, or Exelon
and its subsidiaries could be subject to legal claims, any of which could contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on the business and/or results of operations. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against
losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result. The Utility Registrants  deployment of smart meters
throughout their service territories could increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third parties. In addition, new or updated security regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current
measures taken by the Registrants or their business operations and could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  
  Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact the Registrants  results of operations. (All Registrants)   
 Certain events, such as an employee strike, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements,
could lead to operating challenges and  
      63

increased costs for the Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs
for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, could arise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their generation, transmission and
distribution operations. If the Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations could be negatively impacted.  
  The Registrants could make investments in new business initiatives, including initiatives mandated by regulators, and markets that may not be successful, and
acquisitions could not achieve the intended financial results. (All Registrants)     Generation could continue to pursue growth in its existing
businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. This could include investment opportunities in renewables, development of natural gas generation, distributed generation, potential expansion of the
existing wholesale gas businesses and entry into liquefied natural gas. Such initiatives could involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified
issues not discovered in the diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market. As these markets mature, there could be new market entrants or expansion by established competitors that increase competition for customers and
resources. Additionally, it is possible that FERC, state public utility commissions or others could impose certain other restrictions on such transactions. All of these factors could result in higher costs or lower revenues than expected, resulting
in lower than planned returns on investment.    The Utility Registrants face risks associated with their regulatory-mandated Smart Grid initiatives.
These risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity and obsolescence of technology. Due to these risks, no assurance can be given that such initiatives will be successful and will not have a material
adverse effect on the Utility Registrants  financial results.      Risks Related to the PHI Merger    
  The merger may not achieve its anticipated results, and Exelon could be unable to integrate the operations of PHI in the manner expected. (Exelon)   
 Exelon and PHI entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits, including, among other things,
cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of Exelon and PHI can be integrated in an efficient, effective and timely manner.
   It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption
of Exelon s businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices and policies, any of which could adversely affect the combined company s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the
merger as and when expected. Exelon could have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs and could adversely affect
Exelon s future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.     The merger may not be accretive to earnings and could cause dilution to
Exelon s earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of Exelon s common stock. (Exelon)     The timing and amount
of accretion expected could be significantly adversely affected by a number of uncertainties, including market conditions, risks related to Exelon s businesses and whether  
      64  

Table of Contents  

the business of PHI is integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Exelon also could encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs, could fail to realize all of the benefits
anticipated in the merger or be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in Exelon s adjusted earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and
contribute to a decrease in the price of Exelon s common stock.     Exelon could incur unexpected transaction fees and merger-related costs in connection with
the merger. (Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)     Exelon is incurring costs to combine the operations of Exelon, PHI and its subsidiaries. Exelon
and PHI could incur additional unanticipated costs in the integration of the businesses of the two companies. Although Exelon and PHI expect that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related
to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, the combined company may not achieve this net benefit in the near term, or at all.  
  Exelon could encounter unexpected difficulties or costs in meeting commitments it made under various orders and agreements associated with regulatory approvals for
the PHI Merger. (Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)     As a result of the process to obtain regulatory approvals required for the PHI Merger, Exelon
is committed to various programs, contributions and investments in several settlement agreements and regulatory approval orders, one of which may remain subject to the  most favored nation  reconciliation process. It is possible that
Exelon could encounter delays, unexpected difficulties, or additional costs in meeting these commitments in compliance with the terms of the relevant agreements and orders. Failure to fulfill the commitments in accordance with their terms could
result in increased costs or result in penalties or fines that could adversely affect Exelon s, PHI s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s financial position and operating results.

(a) 
 All nuclear stations are boiling water reactors except Braidwood, Byron, Calvert Cliffs, Ginna, Salem and Three Mile Island, which are pressurized water reactors.    

(c) 
 Base-load units are plants that normally operate to take all or part of the minimum continuous load of a system and, consequently, produce electricity at an essentially constant rate. Intermediate units are plants that
normally operate to take load of a system during the daytime higher load hours and, consequently, produce electricity by cycling on and off daily. Peaking units consist of lower-efficiency, quick response steam units, gas turbines and diesels
normally used during the maximum load periods.    

(d) 
 For nuclear stations, capacity reflects the annual mean rating. Fossil stations reflect a summer rating. Wind and solar facilities reflect name plate capacity.    

(e) 
 Generation has agreed to permanently cease generation operation at Oyster Creek by November 30, 2019.

  Dividends     Under applicable Federal law, Generation, ComEd,
PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL or ACE may limit the dividends that these companies can
distribute to Exelon.    The Federal Power Act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility  to participate in
the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  What constitutes  funds properly included in capital account  is undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related
regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividend is not excessive and (3) there is no self-dealing on
the part of corporate officials. While these restrictions may limit the absolute amount of dividends that a particular subsidiary may pay, Exelon does not believe these limitations are materially limiting because, under these limitations, the
subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends sufficient to meet Exelon s actual cash needs.    Under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on
its stock unless, among other things,  [its] earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay same after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves,  or unless it has specific authorization from the ICC. ComEd has
also agreed in connection with a financing arranged through ComEd Financing III that ComEd will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend
 
      77  

Table of Contents  

the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust
securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued. No such event has occurred.  
 PECO has agreed in connection with financings arranged through PEC L.P. and PECO Trust IV that PECO will not declare dividends on any shares of its
capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of
distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued. No such event has
occurred.    BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the MDPSC. First, in connection with the Constellation merger, BGE
was prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity ratio would be below 48% as
calculated pursuant to the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must notify the MDPSC that it intends
to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid and notify the MDPSC that BGE s equity ratio is at least 48% within five business days after dividend payment. There are no other limitations on BGE
paying common stock dividends unless BGE elects to defer interest payments on the 6.20% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid.  
 Pepco is subject to certain dividend restrictions limits imposed by: (i) state corporate laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be
used to pay dividends, and (ii) the prior rights of holders of future preferred stock, if any, and existing and future mortgage bonds and other long-term debt issued by Pepco and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence
of liabilities.    DPL is subject to certain dividend restrictions imposed by: (i) state corporate laws, which impose limitations on the funds
that can be used to pay dividends, and (ii) the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long-term debt issued by DPL and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of
liabilities.    ACE is subject to dividend restrictions imposed by: (i) state corporate laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be
used to pay dividends and the regulatory requirement that ACE obtain the prior approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30%; (ii) the prior
rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long-term debt issued by ACE and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities; and (iii) certain provisions of the charter of
ACE which impose restrictions on payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders. Currently, the restriction in the ACE charter does not limit its ability to pay common stock dividends.  
 Exelon s Board of Directors has approved a dividend policy providing a raise of 2.5% each year for three years, beginning with the June 2016
dividend.    At December 31, 2016, Exelon had retained earnings of $12,030 million, including Generation s undistributed earnings of
$2,275 million, ComEd s retained earnings of $987 million consisting of retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $2,626 million, partially offset by $(1,639) million of unappropriated accumulated deficits,
PECO s retained earnings of $941 million, BGE s retained earnings of $1,427 million, and PHI s undistributed earnings of $(61) million.

Increase of $109 million at BGE primarily due to increased transmission revenue as a result of increased capital investments and operating and maintenance expense recoveries and increased distribution revenue
pursuant to increased rates as a result of the distribution rate orders issued by the MDPSC in June 2016 and July 2016;        

Increase of $105 million at Generation primarily due to the impact of the Ginna Reliability Support Services Agreement and a decrease in nuclear outage days at higher capacity units despite an increase in overall
outage days, partially offset by lower realized energy prices; and        

Increase of $105 million at PECO primarily due to increased electric distribution revenue pursuant to a rate increase effective January 1, 2016.    
 The year-over-year increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense described above was partially offset by a decrease of
$298 million at Generation due to   mark-to-market   losses of $41 million in 2016 from economic hedging activities as compared to gains of $257 million in
2015.    Operating and maintenance expense increased by $1,726 million as compared to 2015. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the
following unfavorable factors:      

Approval of the merger across all regulatory jurisdictions was conditioned on Exelon and PHI agreeing to certain commitments pursuant to which, upon acquisition close, Exelon recorded $513 million of costs;

Increase in Generation s labor, contracting and materials cost of $185 million related to the inclusion of Pepco Energy Services results in 2016 and increased contracting costs related to energy efficiency
projects;        

Increase of $54 million at BGE primarily as a result of  one-time  charges associated with the reduction of regulatory assets and other long-lived assets stemming from certain
cost disallowances contained within the distribution rate orders issued by the MDPSC in June and July 2016; and    
      87

Increase of $28 million at Generation for the recognition of  one-time  charges associated with Generation s 2016 decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities
nuclear generating facilities.      The year-over-year increase in operating and maintenance expense was partially offset by the following
favorable factors:      

Decrease of $79 million at Generation as a result of the annual update of the Generation nuclear decommissioning obligation related to the  non-regulatory  units in 2016 versus
2015;        

Decrease of $79 million at Generation as a result of a decrease in nuclear outage days in 2016, excluding Salem; and        

Decrease of $77 million in pension and  non-pension  post-retirement benefit costs resulting from the favorable impact of higher pension and OPEB discount rates in 2016.
     Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1,486 million primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation and
amortization expense related to Generation s previous decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear generating facilities, increased nuclear decommissioning amortization at Generation, increased depreciation expense due to
ongoing capital expenditures across all operating companies and the inclusion of PHI s results for the period of March 24, 2016 to December 31, 2016.  
 Taxes other than income increased $376 million primarily due to increased property and utility taxes as a result of the inclusion of PHI s
results for the period March 24, 2016 to December 31, 2016.    Gain (Loss) on sales of assets decreased $66 million primarily due to
certain Generation projects and contracts being terminated or renegotiated in 2016, partially offset by a gain associated with Generation s sale of the retired New Boston generating site in 2016.  
 Interest expense, net increased by $503 million primarily due to the recognition of the interest due on the asserted penalty related to the Tax
Court s decision on Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position, higher outstanding debt to fund the PHI acquisition and general corporate purposes and the absence of the forward-starting interest rate swaps in 2016.  
 Other, net increased by $459 million primarily due to the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT funds at Generation, partially
offset by the recognition of the penalty related to the Tax Court s decision on Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position.    Exelon s
effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38.3% and 32.2%, respectively. See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
components of the effective income tax rates. Exelon recorded an  after-tax  charge of $98 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the assessment and remeasurement of certain
federal and state PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE uncertain tax positions.    For further detail regarding the financial results for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, including explanation of the  non-GAAP  measure revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, see the discussions of Results of Operations by Segment below.

    Adjusted  (non-GAAP)  Operating Earnings    
 Exelon s adjusted  (non-GAAP)  operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 were
$2,488 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, compared with adjusted  (non-GAAP)  operating earnings of $2,227 million, or $2.49 per diluted share, for the same period in 2015. In addition to net income,
Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of adjusted  (non-GAAP)  operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the
business. Adjusted  (non-GAAP)  operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of
  year-to-year   operating results and provide an indication of Exelon s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not
directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and
planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted  (non-GAAP)  operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more
useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.    The following table provides a reconciliation between net income attributable

   Merger and Acquisition Costs      On
March 23, 2016, the Exelon and PHI Merger was completed. On the merger date, PHI shareholders received $27.25 of cash in exchange for each share of PHI common stock. The resulting company retained the Exelon name and is headquartered in
Chicago.    As a result of the PHI Merger, Exelon has incurred costs associated with evaluating, structuring and executing the PHI Merger transaction
itself, and will continue to incur cost associated with meeting the various commitments set forth by regulators and agreed-upon with other interested parties as part of the merger approval process, and integrating the former PHI businesses into
Exelon.  
      90  

Table of Contents  

  The table below presents the  one-time   pre-tax  charges recognized for the PHI Merger included in the Registrant s respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
   
   In addition to the  one-time  PHI Merger charges discussed above, for the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, expense has been recognized for the PHI Merger, Constellation acquisition and the pending FitzPatrick acquisition as follows:

expensed, $56 million has been paid and recorded as deferred debt issuance costs and $60 million has been incurred and charged to common stock. The remaining costs will be primarily
within Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and will also include approximately $30 million for integration costs expected to be capitalized to Property, plant and
equipment.       Significant 2016 Transactions and Developments   
   PHI Acquisition      On March 23,
2016, Exelon completed its acquisition of PHI for a total cash purchase price of $7.1 billion, significantly expanding its regulated utility business and resulting in a total of over 10 million utility customers. In accounting for the
acquisition as a business combination, Exelon and PHI recorded $4.0 billion in goodwill. Approval of the merger in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland and the District of Columbia was conditioned upon Exelon and PHI agreeing to certain commitments
including customer rate credits, funding for energy efficiency and delivery system modernization programs, and other various requirements, for which Exelon recorded $513 million of Operating and maintenance expense for the year ended
December 31, 2016. The Registrants have also incurred costs for evaluating, structuring and executing the transaction, as well as integrating the former PHI businesses into Exelon. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the
Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the PHI acquisition and related costs.      Illinois
Future Energy Jobs Act      On December 7, 2016, FEJA was signed into law by the Governor of Illinois. FEJA is effective June 1, 2017, and
includes, among other provisions, (1) a ZES providing compensation for certain nuclear-powered generating facilities, (2) an extension of and certain adjustments to ComEd s electric distribution formula rate, (3) new cumulative persisting
annual energy efficiency MWh savings goals for ComEd, (4) revisions to the Illinois RPS requirements, (5) provisions for adjustments to or termination of FEJA programs if the average impact on ComEd s customer rates exceeds specified limits,
(6) revisions to the existing net metering statute to (i) mandate net metering for community generation projects, and establish billing procedures for subscribers to those projects, (ii) provide immediately for netting at the energy-only rate for
nonresidential customers, and (iii) transition from netting at the full retail rate to the energy-only rate for certain residential net metering customers once the net meter customer load equals 5% of total peak demand supplied in the previous year
and (7) support for low income rooftop and community solar programs. FEJA establishes new or adjusts existing rate recovery mechanisms for ComEd to recover costs associated with the new or expanded energy efficiency and RPS requirements. Regulatory
or legal challenges over the validity of FEJA are possible. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding FEJA. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements
of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impacts of ZES on Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
   New York Clean Energy Standard      On
August 1, 2016, the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) issued an order establishing the CES, a component of a Tier 3 ZEC program targeted at preserving the environmental attributes of qualifying
 zero-emissions  nuclear-powered generating facilities, including CENG s Ginna, and Nine Mile Point and Entergy Nuclear Fitzpatrick LLC s (Entergy) 838 MW single unit James A. FitzPatrick facilities.
On November 18, 2016, required contracts with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) were executed for each of these three plants.  
      92  

Table of Contents  

Regulatory and legal challenges over the validity the New York CES have been made, the outcomes of which remain uncertain. Also in August 2016, Generation executed a series of agreements with
Entergy to acquire the Fitzpatrick nuclear generating station, subject to various regulatory approvals. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first or second quarter of 2017. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters Matters of the Combined Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for regulatory updates related to the New York CES, Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relative to Ginna and
Nine Mile Point, and Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Generation s proposed acquisition of FitzPatrick.  
   Potential Early Nuclear Plant Retirements    
 Exelon and Generation continually evaluate the current and expected economic value of each of Generation s nuclear plants. Factors that will
continue to affect the economic value of Generation s nuclear plants include, but are not limited to: market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential legislative and regulatory solutions to ensure nuclear plants are fairly
compensated for their carbon-free emissions, and the impact of final rules from the EPA requiring reduction of carbon and other emissions and the efforts of states to implement those final rules. In 2015 and 2016, Generation identified the Clinton,
Quad Cities, Ginna, Nine Mile Point, and Three Mile Island nuclear plants as having the greatest risk of early retirement based on economic valuation and other factors. On June 2, 2016, Generation announced its decision to shut down the
Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants on June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018, respectively; thereby resulting in accelerated depreciation for these plant assets thereafter. With the passage of the Illinois ZES on December 7, 2016,
Generation reversed its original decision, and revised the expected economic useful lives for both facilities to 2027 for Clinton and to 2032 for Quad Cities. Furthermore, assuming the successful implementation of the Illinois ZES and the New York
CES for their entire terms, Generation no longer considers Clinton, Quad Cities, Ginna or Nine Mile Point to be at heightened risk of early retirement. Generation currently considers Three Mile Island to be at the greatest risk of early retirement
due to current economic valuations and other factors. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
   Like-Kind Exchange      On
September 19, 2016, the United States Tax Court rejected Exelon s position on its 1999 income tax return to defer under the like-kind exchange provisions of the IRC $1.2 billion of tax gain on the sale of ComEd s fossil
generating assets. In addition, contrary to Exelon s evaluation that any penalty was unwarranted, the Tax Court ruled that Exelon is liable for the penalty and interest thereon asserted by the IRS, pursuant to which Exelon and ComEd recorded
charges to earnings in 2016 of $106 million and $86 million, respectively. Exelon expects to timely appeal this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. While awaiting a final calculation from the IRS, Exelon
estimates an approximate $1.4 billion payment will be due, including $300 million form ComEd, in the second quarter of 2017 at the time it expects to file its appeal. Of this amount, Exelon deposited with the IRS $1.25 billion in
October 2016, with the remainder to be paid at the time the appeal is filed. See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the like-kind exchange tax matter, including
Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impacts of  after-tax  interest or penalty amounts on ComEd s equity.  
   BGE 2015 Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Base Rates    
 On November 6, 2015, and as amended through the course of the proceeding, BGE filed for electric and natural gas base rate increases with the MDPSC,
which included recovery of electric and  
      93  

Table of Contents  

natural gas smart grid initiative costs. On June 3, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order in which the MDPSC found compelling evidence to conclude that BGE s smart grid initiative overall was
cost beneficial to customers. However, the June 3 order contained several cost disallowances and adjustments, which BGE filed a petition for rehearing on and certain of which were reversed by the MDPSC in an order issued on July 29, 2016.
See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.      Pepco Maryland 2016
Electric Distribution Base Rates      On November 15, 2016, the MDPSC approved an increase in electric distribution base rates of
$53 million based on a ROE of 9.55%. The new rates became effective for services rendered on or after November 15, 2016. MDPSC also approved Pepco s recovery of substantially all of its capital investment and regulatory assets
associated with its AMI program as part of the newly effective rates as well as recovery over a five-year period of transition costs related to a new billing system implemented in 2015. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2016, Exelon, PHI and
Pepco established a regulatory asset of $13 million, wrote off $3 million in disallowed AMI costs and recorded a  pre-tax  credit to net income for $10 million. Additionally, the MDPSC denied
Pepco s request to extend its Grid Resiliency Program surcharge for new system reliability and safety improvement projects, with costs for such programs to be recovered going forward through base rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.      DPL Delaware 2016 Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Base
Rates      The DPSC approved provisional increases in annual electric and natural gas distribution base rates of $2.5 million effective
May 17, 2016, and an additional $30 million effective December 17, 2016, for electric and of $2.5 million effective May 17, 2016, and an additional $10 million effective December 17, 2016, for gas. These increases
are subject to refund based on the final DPSC orders. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  
 DPL filed an application with the DPSC to increase its annual electric and natural gas distribution base rates by $63 million and $22 million,
respectively, based on a requested ROE of 10.6%. While the DPSC is not required to issue a decision on the application within a specified period of time, Delaware law allowed DPL to put into effect $2.5 million of each of the rate increases two
months after filing the applications which were effective July 16, 2016. On December 1, 2016, the DPSC approved that an additional $30 million in electric distribution base rates be implemented effective December 17, 2016,
subject to refund based on the final DPSC order, and an additional $10 million in gas base rates be implemented effective December 17, 2016, subject to refund based on the final DPSC order. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.      ACE 2016 Electric Distribution Base Rates    
 On August 24, 2016, the NJBPU issued an order approving a stipulation of settlement among ACE, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, NJBPU Staff
and Unimin Corporation, and an increase of $45 million (before New Jersey sales and use tax) to its electric distribution base rates, with the new rates effective immediately. The stipulation of settlement provided that a determination on
PowerAhead would be separated into a phase II of the rate proceeding and decided at a later date, most likely in the first quarter of 2017. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

     Exelon s Strategy and Outlook for 2017 and Beyond   
 Exelon s value proposition and competitive advantage come from its scope and its core strengths of operational excellence and financial discipline.
Exelon leverages its integrated business model to create value. Exelon s regulated and competitive businesses feature a mix of attributes that, when combined, offer shareholders and customers a unique value proposition:  

Exelon s utilities provide a foundation for stable earnings, which translates to a stable currency in our stock.        

Generation s competitive businesses provide free cash flow to invest primarily into the utilities and in long-term, contracted assets and to reduce debt.    
 Exelon believes its strategy provides a platform for optimal success in an energy industry experiencing fundamental and sweeping change.  
 Exelon s utility strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms
provide the utilities fair financial returns. The Exelon utilities only invest in rate base where it provides a benefit to customers and the community by improving reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. The
Exelon utilities make these investments at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. Exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of resources and best practices to
achieve improved operational and financial results. Additionally, ComEd, PECO and BGE anticipate making significant future investments in smart meter technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects,
providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.    Generation s competitive businesses
create value for customers by providing innovative solutions and reliable, clean and affordable energy. Generation s electricity generation strategy is to pursue opportunities that provide stable revenues and generation to load matching to
reduce earnings volatility. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to deliver energy to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation s customer facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative
energy-related products and services for its customers. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which
consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source diversity. These factors help Generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.  
 Exelon s financial priorities are to maintain investment grade credit metrics at each of the Registrants, to maintain optimal capital structure and
to return value to Exelon s shareholders with an attractive dividend throughout the energy commodity market cycle and through stable earnings growth. Exelon s Board of Directors has approved a dividend policy providing a raise of 2.5% each
year for three years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend.    Various market, financial, regulatory, legislative and operational factors could
affect the Registrants  success in pursuing their strategies. Exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions to these issues. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information.  
 Continually optimizing the cost structure is a key component of Exelon s financial strategy. Through a recent focused cost management program, the
company has committed to reducing operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs by approximately $350 million and $50 million,  
      95

respectively, of which approximately 35% of  run-rate  savings was achieved by the end of 2016. Approximately 60% of
 run-rate  savings are expected to be achieved by the end of 2017 and fully realized in 2018. At least 75% of the savings are expected to be allocated to Generation, with the remaining amount allocated to the
Utility Registrants.      Growth Opportunities    
 Management continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with Exelon s businesses, assets and markets, leveraging Exelon s expertise in
those areas and offering sustainable returns.     Regulated Energy Businesses   .   The PHI merger provides an opportunity to
accelerate Exelon s regulated growth to provide stable cash flows, earnings accretion, and dividend support. Additionally, the Utility Registrants anticipate investing approximately $25 billion over the next five years in electric and
natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart meter and smart grid initiatives, storm hardening, advanced reliability technologies, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to
current rate base of approximately $9 billion by the end of 2021. The Utility Registrants invest in rate base where beneficial to customers and the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer
needs. These investments are made at the lowest reasonable cost to customers.    See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Smart Meter and Smart Grid Initiatives and infrastructure development and enhancement programs.  
  Competitive Energy Businesses   .     Generation continually assesses the optimal structure and composition of our generation
assets as well as explores wholesale and retail opportunities within the power and gas sectors. Generation s long-term growth strategy is to prioritize investments in long-term contracted generation across multiple technologies and identify and
capitalize on opportunities that provide generation to load matching as a means to provide stable earnings, while identifying emerging technologies where strategic investments provide the option for significant future growth or influence in market
development. As of December 31, 2016, Generation has currently approved plans to invest a total of approximately $1 billion in 2017 through 2019 on capital growth projects (primarily new plant construction and distributed generation).  
    Liquidity Considerations     Each of
the Registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, retire debt, pay dividends, fund
pension and OPEB obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. A broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet its needs and fund growth including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project
financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.
   Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE have unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of
$0.6 billion, $5.3 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.6 billion, $0.6 billion, $0.5 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. Generation also has bilateral credit facilities with aggregate maximum
availability of $0.5 billion. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Matters Exelon Credit Facilities below.

    Project Financing    
 Generation utilizes individual project financings as a means to finance the construction of various generating asset projects. Project financing is based
upon a nonrecourse financial structure, in which project debt and equity used to finance the project are paid back from the cash generated by the newly constructed asset once operational. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets
and equity of each respective project. The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event of a default. If a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific nonrecourse debt financing
covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, the lenders or security holders would
generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher
likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful life. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on nonrecourse debt.      ExGen Texas Power    
 In September 2014, ExGen Texas Power, LLC (EGTP), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, issued $675 million aggregate principal amount of
a nonrecourse senior secured term loan. The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for general business purposes. EGTP s operating cash flows have been negatively impacted by certain market conditions including, but not limited to: low
power prices, higher fuel prices and the seasonality of its cash flows . Despite the declining operating cash flows, EGTP remains in compliance with its covenants related to the project specific financing. Management continues to monitor the project
entity s short term liquidity needs. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the EGTP.  
    Other Key Business Drivers and Management Strategies   
  Utility Rates and Rate Proceedings     The Utility Registrants
file rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these
regulatory proceedings impact the Utility Registrants  current and future results of operations, cash flows and financial position. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on these regulatory proceedings.     Power Markets   
   Price of Fuels      The use of new
technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in
Exelon s revenues. Forward natural gas prices have declined significantly over the last several years; in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).  
   Capacity Market Changes in PJM      In the
wake of the January 2014 Polar Vortex that blanketed much of the Eastern and Midwestern United States, it became clear that while a major outage event was narrowly avoided, resources in PJM were not providing the level of reliability expected by
customers. As a result, on December 12,  
      97  

Table of Contents  

2014, PJM filed at FERC a proposal to make significant changes to its current capacity market construct, the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM). PJM s proposed changes generally sought to
improve resource performance and reliability largely by limiting the excuses for  non-performance  and by increasing the penalties for performance failures. The proposal permits suppliers to include in capacity
market offers additional costs and risk so they can meet these higher performance requirements. While offers are expected to put upward pressure on capacity clearing prices, operational improvements made as a result of PJM s proposal are
expected to improve reliability, to reduce energy production costs as a result of more efficient operations and to reduce the need for out of market energy payments to suppliers. Generation participated actively in PJM s stakeholder process
through which PJM developed the proposal and also actively participated in the FERC proceeding including filing comments. On June 9, 2015, FERC approved PJM s filing largely as proposed by PJM, including transitional auction rules for
delivery years 2016/2017 through 2017/2018. As a result of this and several related orders, PJM hosted its 2018/2019 Base Residual Auction (results posted on August 21, 2015) and its transitional auction for delivery year 2016/2017 (results
posted on August 31, 2015) and its transitional auction for delivery years 2017/2018 (results posted on September 9, 2015). On May 10, 2016, FERC largely denied rehearing, and a number of parties appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the DC Circuit for review of the decision. It is too early in the process to predict the appeal outcome.      MISO Capacity Market Results
     On April 14, 2015, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) released the results of its capacity auction covering the June
2015 through May 2016 delivery year. As a result of the auction, capacity prices for the zone 4 region in downstate Illinois increased to $150 per MW per day beginning in June 2015, an increase from the prior pricing of $16.75 per MW per day
that was in effect from June 2014 to May 2015. Generation had an offer that was selected in the auction. However, due to Generation s ratable hedging strategy, the results of the capacity auction have not had a material impact on Exelon s
and Generation s consolidated results of operations and cash flows.    Additionally, in late May and June 2015, separate complaints were filed at
the FERC by each of the State of Illinois, the Southwest Electric Cooperative, Public Citizens, Inc., and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers challenging the results of this MISO capacity auction for the 2015/2016 delivery in MISO delivery zone
4. The complaints allege generally that 1) the results of the capacity auction for zone 4 are not just and reasonable, 2) the results should be suspended, set for hearing and replaced with a new just and reasonable rate, 3) a refund date should be
established and that 4) certain alleged behavior by one of the market participants other than Exelon or Generation, be investigated.    On
October 1, 2015, the FERC announced that it was conducting a  non-public  investigation (that does not involve Exelon or Generation) into whether market manipulation or other potential violations occurred
related to the auction. On December 31, 2015, the FERC issued a decision that certain of the rules governing the establishment of capacity prices in downstate Illinois are  not just and reasonable  on a prospective basis. The FERC
ordered that certain rules be changed prior to the April 2016 auction which set capacity prices for the 2016/2017 planning year. In response to this order, MISO filed certain rule changes with the FERC. On March 18, 2016, FERC largely denied
rehearing of its December 31, 2015 order. FERC continues to conduct its  non-public  investigation to determine if the April 2015 auction results were manipulated and, if so, whether refunds are
appropriate. The FERC did establish May 28, 2015, the day the first complaint was filed, as the date from which refunds (if ordered) would be calculated, and it also made clear that the findings in the December 31, 2015 order do not
prejudge the investigation or related proceedings. Generation cannot predict the impact the FERC order may ultimately have on future auction results, capacity pricing or decisions related to the potential early retirement of the Clinton nuclear
plant, however, such impacts could be material to Generation s future results of operations and cash flows. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the impacts of the MISO announcement.

Table of Contents  

  MISO has acknowledged the need for capacity market design changes in the zone 4 regions, and on
November 1, 2016 filed a comprehensive capacity market proposal for the zone 4 region (as well as another zone). It is too early to predict the outcome of that filing. Exelon is generally supportive of such changes. However, several fossil
generators have requested that FERC impose an expanded minimum offer price rule (MOPR) that could affect capacity offers from the Clinton nuclear plant. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on the impacts of the MISO announcement. Exelon is actively participating in this aspect of the proceeding, seeking to avoid the implementation of such a MOPR mechanism. However, it is too early in the
proceeding to predict.      Subsidized Generation    
 The rate of expansion of subsidized generation, in the markets in which Generation s output is sold can negatively impact wholesale power prices,
and in turn, Generation s results of operations.    Various states have attempted to implement or propose legislation, regulations or other
policies to subsidize new generation development which may result in artificially depressed wholesale energy and capacity prices. For example, the New Jersey legislature enacted into law in January 2011, the Long Term Capacity Pilot Program Act
(LCAPP). LCAPP provides eligible generators with  15-year  fixed contracts for the sale of capacity in the PJM capacity market. Under LCAPP, the local utilities in New Jersey are required to pay (or
receive) the difference between the price eligible generators receive in the capacity market and the price guaranteed under the  15-year  contract. New Jersey ultimately selected three proposals to
participate in LCAPP and build new generation in the state. In addition, on April 12, 2012, the MDPSC issued an order directing the Maryland electric utilities to enter into a  20-year  contract for
differences (CfD) with CPV Maryland, LLC (CPV), under which CPV was required to construct an approximately 700 MW combined cycle gas turbine in Waldorf, Maryland. The CfD mandated that utilities (including BGE, Pepco and DPL) pay (or receive) the
difference between CPV s contract price and the revenues it receives for capacity and energy from clearing the unit in the PJM capacity market.  
 Exelon and others challenged the constitutionality and other aspects of the New Jersey legislation in federal court. The actions taken by the MDPSC were
also challenged in federal court in an action to which Exelon was not a party. The federal trial courts in both the New Jersey and Maryland actions effectively invalidated the actions taken by the New Jersey legislature and the MDPSC, respectively.
Each of those decisions was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, respectively. On April 19, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and subsequently denied certiorari with respect to the appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, leaving in place that court s decision. The matter is now considered closed.  
 As required under their contracts, generator developers who were selected in the New Jersey and Maryland programs (including CPV) offered and cleared in
PJM s capacity market auctions. To the extent that the state-required customer subsidies are included under their respective contracts, Exelon believes that these projects may have artificially suppressed capacity prices in PJM in these
auctions and may continue to do so in future auctions to the detriment of Exelon. While the court decisions are positive developments, continuation of these state efforts, if successful and unabated by an effective minimum offer price rule
(MOPR) for future capacity auctions, could continue to result in artificially depressed wholesale capacity and/or energy prices. Other states could seek to establish programs, which could substantially impact Exelon s position and could have a
significant effect on Exelon s financial results of operations, financial position and cash flows.    One such state is Ohio, where
state-regulated utility companies FirstEnergy Ohio (FE) and AEP Ohio (AEP) initiated actions at the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to obtain approval for Riders that would effectively allow these two companies to pass through to all
customers in their service territories the differences between their costs and market revenues on PPAs entered into  
      99  

Table of Contents  

between the utility and its merchant generation affiliate for what was collectively more than 6,000MW of primarily coal-fired generation. Thus, the Riders were similar to the CfDs described
above (except that the PPA Riders in Ohio would apply to existing generation facilities whereas the CfDs applied to new generation facilities). While FERC orders on April 27, 2016 largely alleviated the concerns related to the Riders by holding
that the PPAs ran afoul of affiliate restrictions on FE and AEP, we continue to closely monitor developments in Ohio.    In addition, Exelon continues
to monitor developments in Maryland, New Jersey, and other states and participates in stakeholder and other processes to ensure that similar state subsidies are not developed. Exelon remains active in advocating for competitive markets, while
opposing policies that require taxpayers and/ or consumers to subsidize or give preferential treatment to generation providers or technologies that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefits, or that would threaten the reliability
and value of the integrated electricity grid.      Complaints at FERC Seeking to Mitigate Illinois and New York Programs Providing ZECs
     PJM and NYISO capacity markets include a Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) that is intended to preclude buyers from exercising buyer market
power. If a resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer is adjusted to remove the revenues it receives through a federal, state or other government-provided financial support program resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity
market. Currently, the MOPRs in PJM and NYISO apply only to certain new resources. Exelon has generally opposed policies that required subsidies or give preferential treatment to generation providers or technologies that do not provide superior
reliability or environmental benefits, or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid. Thus, Exelon has supported a MOPR as a means of minimizing the detrimental impact of certain subsidized resources could have
on capacity markets (such as the New Jersey (LCAPP) and Maryland (CfD) programs. However, in Exelon s view, MOPRs should not be applied to resources that receive compensation for providing superior reliability or environmental benefits.  
 On January 9, 2017, the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) filed two requests with FERC: one seeking to amend a prior complaint against PJM
and another seeking expedited action on a pending NYISO compliance filing in an existing proceeding. Both filings allege that the relevant MOPR should be expanded to also apply to existing resources receiving ZEC compensation under the New York CES
and Illinois ZES programs. Exelon has filed protests at FERC in response to each filing, arguing generally that ZEC payments provide compensation for an environmental attribute that is distinct from the energy and capacity sold in the
FERC-jurisdictional markets, and therefore, are no different than other renewable support programs like the PTC and RPS that have generally not been subject to a MOPR. However, if successful, an expanded MOPR could result in mitigation of
Generation s Quad Cities, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point facilities, which are expected to receive ZEC compensation, such that they would have an increased risk of not clearing in future capacity auctions and thus no longer receiving capacity
revenues during the respective ZEC programs. This would also impact the FitzPatrick facility that Generation is currently in the process of acquiring from Entergy. Any mitigation of these generating resources could have a material effect on
Exelon s and Generation s future cash flows and results of operations. The timing of FERC s decision with respect to both proceedings is currently unknown and the outcome of these matters is currently uncertain.  
   Energy Demand      Modest economic growth
partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives is resulting in positive growth for electricity for Pepco, a decrease in projected load for electricity for BGE, DPL and ACE, and an essentially flat projected load for electricity for ComEd and
PECO. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE are projecting load volumes to increase (decrease) by (0.3)%, 0.6%, (1.4)%, (1.7)%, 0.8% and (0.7)%, respectively, in 2017 compared 2016.  
      100

    Retail Competition    
 Generation s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes
that it is able to serve. The market experienced high price volatility in the first quarter of 2014 which contributed to bankruptcies and consolidations within the industry during the year. However, forward natural gas and power prices are expected
to remain low and thus we expect retail competitors to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share, and that wholesale generators (including Generation) will continue to use their retail operations to hedge generation output.  
  Strategic Policy Alignment     As part of its strategic business
planning process, Exelon routinely reviews its hedging policy, dividend policy, operating and capital costs, capital spending plans, strength of its balance sheet and credit metrics, and sufficiency of its liquidity position, by performing various
stress tests with differing variables, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging practices, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades.  
 Exelon s board of directors declared first quarter 2016 dividends of $0.31 per share each on Exelon s common stock. The second, third and
fourth quarter 2016 dividends declared was $0.318 on Exelon s common stock, and the first quarter 2017 dividends declared was $0.328 per share. The dividends for the first, second, third and fourth quarter 2016 were paid on March 10, 2016,
June 10, 2016, September 9, 2016 and December 9, 2016, respectively. The first quarter 2017 dividend is payable on March 10, 2017.  
 Exelon s Board of Directors has approved a dividend policy providing a raise of 2.5% each year for three years, beginning with the June 2016
dividend.     Hedging Strategy     Exelon s policy to
hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio.
Generation enters into  non-derivative  and derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with
credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. Generation has hedges in place that significantly mitigate this risk for 2017 and 2018. However, Generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk in the subsequent
years with respect to which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio is currently unhedged. As of December 31, 2016, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was
 91%-94%,   56%-59%  and  28%-31%  for 2017, 2018, and 2019 respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of
equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generating facilities based upon a simulated dispatch model that
makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, such as wholesale and retail sales of power, options
and swaps. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk in subsequent years as well.  
 Generation procures oil and natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly
through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain
nuclear fuel services, coal, oil and natural gas are subject to price fluctuations and availability  
      101  

Table of Contents  

restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential  non-performance  of
counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately 39% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements from 2017 through 2021 are supplied by three producers. In the event of  non-performance  by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply
agreements.  Non-performance  by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  
 The Utility Registrants mitigate commodity price risk through regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover procurement costs from retail customers.
    Tax Matters       Potential Corporate Tax Reform
     The results of the November 2016 U.S. elections have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to federal tax policies. President
Trump has stated that one of his top priorities is comprehensive tax reform and House Republicans plan to advance their tax reform  blueprint . Tax reform proposals call for a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from
the current 35% to as low as 15%. Other proposals provide, among other items, for the immediate deduction of capital investment expenditures and full or partial elimination of debt interest expense deductions. It is uncertain whether, to
what extent or when these or any other changes in federal tax policies will be enacted or the transition time frame for such changes. Further, for the Utility Registrants, regulators may impose rate reductions to provide the benefit of any
income tax expense reductions to customers and refund  excess  deferred income taxes previously collected through rates. The amounts and timing of any such rate changes would be subject to the discretion of the rate regulator in each
specific jurisdiction. For these reasons, the Registrants cannot predict the impact any potential changes may have on their future results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and such changes could be material.  
 See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information  
  Environmental Legislative and Regulatory Developments     Exelon
is actively involved in the EPA s development and implementation of environmental regulations for the electric industry, in pursuit of its business strategy to provide reliable, clean, affordable and innovative energy products. These efforts
have most frequently involved air, water and waste controls for electric generating units, as set forth in the discussion below. These regulations have a disproportionate adverse impact on fossil-fuel power plants, requiring significant expenditures
of capital and variable operating and maintenance expense, and have resulted in the retirement of older, marginal facilities. Retirements of coal-fired power plants will continue as additional EPA regulations take effect, and as air quality
standards are updated and further restrict emissions. Due to its low emission generation portfolio, Generation will not be significantly directly affected by these regulations, representing a competitive advantage relative to electric generators
that are more reliant on fossil-fuel plants. Various bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would prohibit or impede the EPA s rulemaking efforts, and it is uncertain whether any of these bills will become law.  
   Air Quality      In recent years, the EPA
has been implementing a series of increasingly stringent regulations under the Clean Air Act applicable to electric generating units. These regulations have resulted in more stringent emissions limits on fossil-fuel electric generating stations as
states implement their compliance plans.  
      102  

Table of Contents  

   National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  The EPA continues to review and update its NAAQS for
conventional air pollutants relating to ground-level ozone and emissions of particulate matter, SO2 and NOx. Following five years of litigation, the EPA is implementing the Cross State Air Pollution Rule that requires upwind states in the eastern
half of the United States to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in downwind states, and otherwise contributes to  non-attainment  status of downwind states with the various NAAQS requirements.     Mercury and Air Toxics Standard
Rule (MATS).  On December 16, 2011, the EPA signed a final rule to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants and signed revisions to the NSPS for electric generating units. The final rule, known as MATS, requires coal-fired
electric generation plants to achieve high removal rates of mercury, acid gases and other metals, and to make capital investments in pollution control equipment and incur higher operating expenses. The initial compliance deadline to meet the new
standards was April 16, 2015; however, facilities may have been granted an additional one or two year extension in limited cases.   Numerous entities challenged MATS in the D.C. Circuit Court, and Exelon intervened in support of the rule.
In April 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion upholding MATS in its entirety. On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in June 2015 that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate and necessary
to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, did not vacate the rule; rather, it was remanded to the D.C. Circuit Court to take further action consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court s
opinion on this single issue. As such, the MATS rule remains in effect. Exelon will continue to participate in the remanded proceedings before the D.C. Circuit Court as an intervenor in support of the rule.  
  Climate Change.  Exelon supports comprehensive climate change legislation or regulation, including a   cap-and-trade   program for GHG emissions, which balances the need to protect consumers, business and the economy with the urgent need to reduce national GHG emissions. In the absence of Federal legislation,
the EPA is moving forward with the regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. In addition, there have been recent developments in the international regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change ( UNFCCC  of  Convention ). See ITEM 1. BUSINESS, Global Climate Change  for further discussion.  
   Water Quality      Section 316(b) of the
Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of
Generation s power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by changes to the existing
regulations. Those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Ginna, Gould Street, Handley, Mountain Creek, Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Riverside, Salem and Schuylkill.
See ITEM 1. BUSINESS , Water Quality  for further discussion.      Solid and Hazardous Waste    
 In October 2015, the first federal regulation for the disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) from power plants became effective. The rule classifies
CCR as  non-hazardous  waste under RCRA. Under the regulation, CCR will continue to be regulated by most states subject to coordination with the federal regulations. Generation has previously recorded reserves
consistent with state regulation for its owned coal ash sites, and as such, the regulation is not expected to impact Exelon s and Generation s financial results. Generation does not have sufficient information to reasonably assess the
potential  
      103  

Table of Contents  

likelihood or magnitude of any remediation requirements that may be asserted under the new federal regulations for coal ash disposal sites formerly owned by Generation. For these reasons,
Generation is unable to predict whether and to what extent it may ultimately be held responsible for remediation and other costs relating to formerly owned coal ash disposal sites under the new regulations.  
 See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to environmental
matters, including the impact of environmental regulation.     Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments   
   NRC Task Force on Fukishima      In July
2011, an NRC Task Force formed in the aftermath of the March 11, 2011, 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami, that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, issued a report of its review of the
accident, including tiered recommendations for future regulatory action by the NRC to be taken in the near and longer term. The Task Force s report concluded that nuclear reactors in the United States are operating safely and do not present an
imminent risk to public health and safety. The NRC and its staff have issued orders and implementation guidance for commercial reactor licensees operating in the United States. The NRC and its staff are continuing to evaluate additional
requirements. Generation has assessed the impacts of the Tier 1 orders and information requests and will continue monitoring the additional recommendations under review by the NRC staff, both from an operational and a financial impact standpoint. A
comprehensive review of the NRC Tier 1 orders and information requests, as well as preliminary engineering assumptions and analysis, indicate that the financial impact of compliance for Generation, net of expected
 co-owner  reimbursements, for the period from 2017 through 2019 is expected to be between approximately $75 million and $100 million of capital and $15 million of operating expense.
Generation s current assessments are specific to the Tier 1 recommendations. The NRC has not finalized actions with respect to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations and is expected to do so in 2017. Exelon and Generation are unable to conclude
at this time to what extent any actions to comply with the requirements of Tier 2 and Tier 3 will impact their future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Generation will continue to engage in nuclear industry assessments and
actions and stakeholder input.     Employees     During 2016,
Exelon BSC and ComEd extended the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with IBEW Local 15 by three years; with an expiration date of September 30, 2022. Exelon Generation extended its CBA with both the IBEW Local 15 (covering the five
(5) Midwest nuclear plants) and IBEW Local 51 (Clinton) by three years; with expiration dates of April 30, 2022 and December 15, 2023, respectively. Additionally, Exelon Nuclear Security successfully ratified its CBA with the
UGSOA Local 17 at Oyster Creek to an extension of five (5) years, and Exelon Power successfully ratified its CBA with the IBEW Local 614 to a three (3) extension. In January 2017, an election was held at BGE which resulted in union
representation for approximately 1,400 employees. BGE and IBEW Local 410 will begin negotiations for an initial agreement which could result in some modifications to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment. No agreement has been
finalized to date and management cannot predict the outcome of such negotiations.       Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions
that affect results of operations and the  
      104  

Table of Contents  

amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with its Accounting and Disclosure Governance Committee on a
regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application, or
incorporate estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional discussion of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.     Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon and Generation)   
 Generation s ARO associated with decommissioning its nuclear units was $8.7 billion at December 31, 2016. The authoritative guidance
requires that Generation estimate its obligation for the future decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants. To estimate that liability, Generation uses an internally-developed, probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a   unit-by-unit   basis, considers multiple decommissioning outcome scenarios.  
 As a result of recent nuclear plant retirements in the industry, nuclear operators and third-party service providers are obtaining more information
about costs associated with decommissioning activities. At the same time, regulators are gaining more information about decommissioning activities which could result in changes to existing decommissioning requirements. In addition, as more nuclear
plants are retired, it is possible that technological advances will be identified that could create efficiencies and lead to a reduction in decommissioning costs. The availability of decommissioning trust funds could impact the timing of the
decommissioning activities. Additionally, certain factors such as changes in regulatory requirements during plant operations or the profitability of a nuclear plant could impact the timing of plant retirements. These factors could result in material
changes to Generation s current estimates as more information becomes available and could change the timing of plant retirements and the probability assigned to the decommissioning outcome scenarios.  
 The nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected
timing and/or estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants, based upon the methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions described as follows:  
   Decommissioning Cost Studies    
 Generation uses   unit-by-unit   decommissioning cost studies to provide a
marketplace assessment of the expected costs (in current year dollars) and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within the industry and other estimates. Decommissioning cost
studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation s nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates (such as a change in assumed operating life for a nuclear plant). As part of the
annual cost study update process, Generation evaluates newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously assumed costs to determine if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimates to the
AROs across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five-year rotating cost study update cycle.      Cost Escalation Factors    
 Generation uses cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost studies discussed above through the assumed
decommissioning period for each of the units. Cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors, and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and materials, energy, LLRW disposal and other
costs. All of the nuclear AROs are adjusted each year for the updated cost escalation factors.

    Probabilistic Cash Flow Models    
 Generation s probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various scenarios for decommissioning cost levels,
decommissioning approaches, and timing of plant shutdown on a   unit-by-unit   basis. Probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs
20% higher (high-cost scenario) or 15% lower  (low-cost  scenario) than the base cost scenario. Probabilities are also assigned to four different decommissioning approaches. In response to expected increased
security costs for spent fuel stored in the spent fuel pool (wet storage), in 2016 Generation has evaluated an alternative approach for managing spent fuel between the date of a plant s cessation of operations and the fuel s acceptance for
disposal by the DOE. This new approach, the Shortened SAFSTOR approach, provides for increased usage of dry cask storage for the spent fuel, and is now considered as one of the decommissioning approaches in determining the ARO as follows:  

1. 
 DECON a method of decommissioning shortly after the cessation of operation in which the equipment, structures, and portions of a facility and site containing radioactive contaminants are removed and safely buried
in a LLRW landfill or decontaminated to a level that permits property to be released for unrestricted use. Spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until DOE acceptance for disposal.    

2. 
 Delayed DECON similar to the DECON scenario but with a delay to allow for spent fuel to be removed from the site prior to onset of decommissioning activities. Spent fuel is retained in existing location (either wet
or dry storage) until DOE acceptance for disposal.        

3. 
 Shortened SAFSTOR similar to the DECON scenario but with generally a 30 year delay prior to onset of decommissioning activities. Spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until DOE
acceptance for disposal.        

4. 
 SAFSTOR a method of decommissioning in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to levels that permit
release for unrestricted use generally within 60 years after cessation of operations. Spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until DOE acceptance for disposal.    
 The actual decommissioning approach selected once a nuclear facility is shutdown will be determined by Generation at the time of shutdown and may be
influenced by multiple factors including the funding status of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at the time of shutdown.    The assumed plant
shutdown timing scenarios include the following four alternatives: (1) the probability of operating through the original  40-year  nuclear license term, (2) the probability of operating through an
extended  60-year  nuclear license term (regardless of whether such  20-year  license extension has been received for each unit), (3) the probability of a second,  20-year  license renewal for some nuclear units, and (4) the probability of early plant retirement for certain sites due to changing market conditions and regulatory environments. The successful operation of
nuclear plants in the U.S. beyond the initial  40-year  license terms has prompted the NRC to consider regulatory and technical requirements for potential plant operations for an
 80-year  nuclear operating term. As power market and regulatory environment developments occur, Generation evaluates and incorporates, as necessary, the impacts of such developments into its nuclear ARO
assumptions and estimates.    Generation s probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of DOE acceptance of SNF for
disposal. Generation currently assumes DOE will begin accepting SNF in 2030. The SNF acceptance date assumption is based on management s estimates of the amount of time required for DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary
infrastructure for long-term SNF storage. For more information regarding the estimated date that DOE will begin accepting SNF, see Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    License Renewals    
 Except for its Clinton unit, Generation has successfully obtained initial  20-year  operating license renewal
extensions (i.e. extending the total license term to 60 years) for all of its operating nuclear units (including the two Salem units  co-owned  by Generation, but operated by PSEG). Generation intends to apply
for an initial  20-year  renewal for the Clinton unit. No prior Generation license extension application has been denied.  
   Discount Rates      The
probability-weighted estimated future cash flows for the various assumed scenarios are discounted using credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (CARFR) applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated. The
accounting guidance required Generation to establish an ARO at fair value at the time of the initial adoption of the current accounting standard. Subsequent to the initial adoption, the ARO is adjusted for changes to estimated costs, timing of
future cash flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions, as described above. Increases in the ARO as a result of upward revisions in estimated undiscounted cash flows are considered new obligations and are measured using a current CARFR
as the increase creates a new cost layer within the ARO. Any decrease in the estimated undiscounted future cash flows relating to the ARO are treated as a modification of an existing ARO cost layer and, therefore, is measured using the average
historical CARFR rates used in creating the initial ARO cost layers.    Under the current accounting framework, the ARO is not required or permitted
to be  re-measured  for changes in the CARFR that occur in isolation. This differs from the accounting requirements for other long-dated obligations, such as pension and other post-employment benefits that are
required to be  re-measured  as and when corresponding discount rates change. If Generation s future nominal cash flows associated with the ARO were to be discounted at current prevailing CARFRs, the
obligation would increase from approximately $8.7 billion to approximately $9.7 billion.    To illustrate the significant impact that
changes in the CARFR, when combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows, can have on the valuation of the ARO: i) had Generation used the 2015 CARFRs rather than the 2016 CARFRs in performing its annual 2016 ARO
update, Generation would have decreased the ARO by an additional $45 million; and ii) if the CARFR used in performing the annual 2016 ARO update was increased by 100 basis points or decreased by 50 basis points, the ARO would have decreased by
$1.2 billion and increased by $150 million, respectively, as compared to the actual decrease of $385 million.      ARO
Sensitivities      Changes in the assumptions underlying the ARO could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. The impact to the ARO of
a change in any one of these assumptions is highly dependent on how the other assumptions may correspondingly change.

  Goodwill (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PHI and DPL)     As of
December 31, 2016, Exelon s $6.7 billion carrying amount of goodwill primarily consists of $2.6 billion at ComEd relating to the acquisition of ComEd in 2000 as part of the formation of Exelon and $4 billion at PHI pursuant
to Exelon s acquisition of PHI in the first quarter of 2016. DPL has $8 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2016, related to its 1995 acquisition of the Conowingo Power Company. Generation also has goodwill of $47 million as
of December 31, 2016. Under the provisions of the authoritative guidance for goodwill, these entities are required to perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. Under the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known
as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating
results are regularly reviewed by segment management. ComEd has a single operating segment, and PHI s operating segments are Pepco, DPL and ACE. See Note 26 Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information. There is no level below these operating segments for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, the ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE operating segments are also considered
reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Exelon s and ComEd s $2.6 billion of goodwill has been assigned entirely to the ComEd reporting unit, while Exelon s and PHI s $4 billion of goodwill has been
assigned to the Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units in the amounts of $1.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. DPL s $8 million of goodwill is assigned entirely to the DPL reporting unit.  
 Entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment
is necessary. In performing a qualitative assessment, entities should assess, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, cost factors, and entity-specific conditions and events.
If an entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, no further testing is required. If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment, or
performs the qualitative assessment but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative  two-step,  fair value-based test is performed.  
      108  

Table of Contents  

  Exelon s, ComEd s and PHI s accounting policy is to perform a quantitative test of goodwill
at least once every three years, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. The first step in the quantitative test compares the
fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual
assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a
reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management
estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and
transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s businesses and the fair value of debt. In applying the second step (if needed), management must estimate the fair value of specific
assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.    Exelon, ComEd, PHI and DPL performed quantitative tests as of November 1, 2016, for their 2016
annual goodwill impairment assessments. The first step of the tests comparing the estimated fair values of the ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units to their carrying values, including goodwill, indicated no impairments of goodwill; therefore,
no second steps were required.    While the annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used to estimate reporting unit fair
values are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon s, ComEd s, PHI s or DPL s goodwill, which could be material. Based
on the results of the annual goodwill tests performed as of November 1, 2016, the estimated fair values of the ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units would have needed to decrease by more than 30%, 10%, 10% and 10%, respectively, for Exelon,
ComEd and PHI to have failed the first step of their respective impairment tests. For the $8 million of goodwill recorded at DPL related to DPL s 1995 acquisition of the Conowingo Power Company, the fair value of the DPL reporting unit
would have needed to decrease by more than 50% for DPL to fail the first step of the impairment test.    See Note 1 Significant Accounting
Policies, Note 11 Intangible Assets and Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
  Purchase Accounting (Exelon, Generation and PHI)     In
accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The difference between the purchase price amount
and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if it exceeds the estimated net fair value and as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if it is below the estimated net fair
value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment, often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the
timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. Accounting
guidance provides that the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year from the date of the merger as more information is obtained about the fair  
      109

value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
    Unamortized Energy Contract Assets and Liabilities (Exelon, Generation, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)   
 Unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of  non-derivative 
energy contracts that Generation has acquired and the electricity and gas energy supply contracts Exelon has acquired as part of the PHI acquisition. The initial amount recorded represents the fair value of the contracts at the time of acquisition.
At PHI, offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities were also recorded. The unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities and any corresponding regulatory assets or liabilities, respectively, are amortized over the life of the contract in
relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows. Amortization expense and income are recorded through purchased power and fuel expense or operating revenues, respectively. Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters,
Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions and Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  
  Impairment of Long-lived Assets (All Registrants)     All
Registrants regularly monitor and evaluate their long-lived assets and asset groups, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment may
include a deteriorating business climate, including declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, advances in technology, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful
life, among others.    The review of long-lived assets and asset groups for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and
estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. For the generation business, forecasting future cash flows requires assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for the sale of power, costs
of fuel and the expected operations of assets. A variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial
statements. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets or asset groups are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the
generation business, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by the evaluation of several factors, including the geographic dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to those units as well as the associated
intangible assets or liabilities recorded on the balance sheet. The cash flows from the generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level with cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk management activities,
including cash flows from related intangible assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. In certain cases, generating assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and
operations are independent of other generating assets (typically contracted renewables).    On a quarterly basis, Generation assesses its asset groups
for indicators of impairment. If indicators are present for a long-lived asset or asset group, a comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value is performed. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates the
carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value less costs to sell. The
fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group is dependent upon a market participant s view of the exit price of the assets. This includes significant assumptions of the estimated future cash flows generated by the assets and market
discount rates. Events and circumstances often do not occur as expected and there will usually be differences between prospective financial information and actual results, and those differences may be material. The determination of fair
 
      110  

Table of Contents  

value is driven by both internal assumptions that include significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) such as revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital, and maintenance expenditures and
discount rates, as well as information from various public, financial and industry sources.    Generation evaluates its equity method investments and
other investments in debt and equity securities to determine whether or not they are impaired based on whether the investment has experienced a decline in value that is not temporary in nature.  
 See Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of asset impairment
evaluations made by Exelon.     Depreciable Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment (All Registrants)   
 The Registrants have significant investments in electric generation assets and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. These
assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis, using the composite method in which depreciation is calculated using the average estimated useful life of assets within an asset group. The estimation of asset useful lives requires
management judgment, supported by formal depreciation studies of historical asset retirement experience. Depreciation studies are completed every five years, or more frequently if required by a rate regulator or if an event, regulatory action, or
change in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary.    For the Utility Registrants, depreciation studies generally serve as the basis for
amounts allowed in customer rates for recovery of depreciation costs. Generally, the Utility Registrants adjust their depreciation rates for financial reporting purposes concurrent with adjustments to depreciation rates reflected in rates, unless
the depreciation rates reflected in rates do not align with management s judgment as to an appropriate estimated useful life or have not been updated on a timely basis. Consistent with each utility s regulatory recovery method, the Utility
Registrant s depreciation expense for each asset group includes an amount for the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service spread straight line over the asset group s average remaining useful life. Estimates for such
removal costs are also evaluated in the periodic depreciation studies.    At Generation, along with depreciation study results, management considers
expected future energy market conditions and generation plant operating costs and capital investment requirements in determining the estimated service lives of its generating facilities. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the
Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on expected and potential early nuclear plant retirements.  
 Generation completed a depreciation rate study during the first quarter of 2015, which resulted in revised depreciation rates effective January 1,
2015.    ComEd is required to file an electric distribution depreciation rate study at least every five years with the ICC. ComEd completed an
electric distribution and transmission depreciation study and filed the updated depreciation rates with both the ICC and FERC in January 2014, resulting in new depreciation rates effective first quarter 2014.  
 PECO is required to file electric distribution and gas depreciation rate studies at least every five years with the PAPUC. In March 2015, PECO filed a
depreciation rate study with the PAPUC for both its electric distribution and gas assets, resulting in new depreciation rates for electric transmission assets effective January 1, 2015, for gas distribution assets effective July 1, 2015,
and for electric distribution assets January 1, 2016.    The MDPSC does not mandate the frequency or timing of BGE s electric distribution
or gas depreciation studies. In July 2014, BGE filed revised depreciation rates with the MDPSC for both its electric distribution and gas assets, which became effective December 15, 2014.  
      111  

Table of Contents  

  The MDPSC does not mandate the frequency or timing of Pepco s electric distribution depreciation
studies, while the DCPSC directs Pepco as to when it should file an electric distribution depreciation study. In 2016 and 2013, Pepco filed revised electric distribution depreciation rates with the MDPSC and DCPSC, respectively, with the new rates
effective November 15, 2016 and April 16, 2014, respectively.    Neither the DPSC nor the MDPSC mandates the frequency or timing of
DPL s electric distribution or gas depreciation studies. DPL filed revised depreciation rates for gas assets in 2006, with the new rates effective April 1, 2007. In 2013, DPL filed revised electric distribution depreciation rates with the
MDPSC, with the new rates effective July 20, 2013. On July 20, 2016, DPL filed revised electric depreciation rates with the MDPSC as part of the electric distribution base rate filing. Any adjustments to the depreciation rates approved by
the MDPSC are expected to take effect in the first quarter of 2017. On May 17, 2016, DPL filed revised electric and natural gas depreciation rates with the DPSC as part of the electric and natural gas base rate case filing. The DPSC is not
required to issue a decision on the application within a specific period of time and adjustments to the depreciation rates will be made based on the outcome of the final orders, when received.  
 The NJBPU does not mandate the frequency or timing of ACE s electric distribution depreciation studies. In 2012, ACE filed revised electric
distribution depreciation rates with the NJBPU, with the new rates effective July 1, 2013.    FERC does not mandate the frequency or timing of
electric transmission depreciation studies.    Changes in estimated useful lives of electric generation assets and of electric and natural gas
transmission and distribution assets could have a significant impact on the Registrants  future results of operations. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant and equipment of the Registrants.     Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Employee Benefits (All Registrants)     Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans for
substantially all employees. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans.    The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits involves various factors, including the development of valuation
assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several
assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, Exelon s expected level of contributions to the plans, the
incidence of participant mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to
employees of certain plans, among others. The assumptions are updated annually and upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. Exelon amortizes actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor of 10% of the greater of the projected
benefit obligation or the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the operating companies are labor costs and are
ultimately allocated to projects within the operating companies, some of which are capitalized.  
      112  

Table of Contents  

  Pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets include equity securities, including U.S. and
international securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real estate, private equity and hedge funds. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement plan assets, including valuation techniques and classification under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with authoritative guidance.  
   Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets    
 The long-term EROA assumption used in calculating pension costs for Exelon plans was 7.00% for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. For the predecessor periods
of 2016, 2015 and 2014, the long-term EROA assumption used in calculating pension costs for the PHI plans was 6.50%, 6.50% and 7.00%, respectively. The weighted after-tax average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs
for Exelon plans was 6.71%, 6.50% and 6.59% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the predecessor periods of 2016, 2015 and 2014, the EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs for PHI plans was 6.75%, 6.75% and
7.25%, respectively. The pension trust activity is  non-taxable,  while other postretirement benefit trust activity is partially taxable. In 2010, Exelon began implementation of a liability-driven investment
strategy in order to reduce the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Over time, Exelon has decreased its equity investments and increased its investments in fixed income securities and alternative investments within
the pension asset portfolio in order to achieve a balanced portfolio of liability hedging and return-generating assets. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding Exelon s asset allocations. Exelon used an EROA of 7.00% and 6.60% to estimate its 2017 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.  
 Exelon calculates the amount of expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the EROA by the MRV of plan
assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. In determining MRV, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of
either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. For the majority of pension plan assets, Exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the
difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. Use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. For other postretirement benefit
plan assets and certain pension plan assets, Exelon uses fair value to calculate the MRV.    Actual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported
for the Exelon-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The actual asset returns across the Registrants  pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 7.30% and 6.02%,
respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of 7.00% and 6.71%, respectively.      Discount Rate    
 The discount rate used to determine the majority of the December 31, 2016 pension and other postretirement benefit obligations was 4.04%,
representing a weighted-average of the rate for the majority of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, for both Exelon and PHI, the discount rates were determined by developing a spot rate curve based on
the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality  non-callable  (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The
spot rates are used to discount the estimated future benefit distribution amounts under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. Exelon
utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates.  
      113  

Table of Contents  

  The discount rate assumptions used to determine the obligation valuation at year end are also used to
determine the cost for the following year. Exelon used discount rates ranging from 3.66% to 4.17% to estimate its 2017 pension and other postretirement benefit costs.  
   Health Care Cost Trend Rate      Assumed
health care cost trend rates impact the costs reported for Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans for participant populations with plan designs that do not have a cap on cost growth. Accounting guidance requires that annual health care
cost estimates be developed using past and present health care cost trends (both for Exelon and across the broader economy), as well as expectations of health care cost escalation, changes in health care utilization and delivery patterns,
technological advances and changes in the health status of plan participants. Therefore, the trend rate assumption is subject to significant uncertainty. Exelon assumed an initial health care cost trend rate of 5.50% for 2016, decreasing to an
ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5.00% in 2017 for the majority of its plans.      Mortality    
 The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an
improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. Exelon uses a mortality base table for its accounting valuation that is consistent with the  IRS-required  table for
determining plan funding requirements pursuant to ERISA (referred to as  RP-2000).  Exelon is utilizing the Scale BB  2-Dimensional  improvement scale with long-term
improvements of 0.75% for its mortality improvement assumption. The mortality assumption is supported by an actuarial experience study on Exelon s plan participants performed in 2014.  
   Sensitivity to Changes in Key Assumptions    
 The following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions
constant (dollars in millions):      

(a) 
 In general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot
necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. Additionally, Exelon implemented a liability-driven investment strategy for a portion of its pension asset portfolio in 2010. The sensitivities shown above do not
reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns.

Table of Contents  

    Average Remaining Service Period    
 For pension benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs and certain actuarial gains and losses, as applicable, based on
participants  average remaining service periods. The average remaining service period of Exelon s defined benefit pension plan participants was 11.9 years, 11.9 years and 11.8 years for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014, respectively. For the predecessor periods, the average remaining service period of PHI s defined benefit plans was approximately 11 years for both 2015 and 2014.  
 For other postretirement benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs over participants  average remaining service period to
benefit eligibility age and amortizes its transition obligations and certain actuarial gains and losses over participants  average remaining service period to expected retirement. The average remaining service period of postretirement benefit
plan participants related to benefit eligibility age was 9.0 years, 10.8 years and 9.1 years for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average remaining service period of postretirement benefit plan participants
related to expected retirement was 9.7 years, 9.7 years and 10.1 years for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the predecessor periods, the average remaining service period of PHI s other postretirement
benefit plans was approximately 11 years for both 2015 and 2014.     Regulatory Accounting (Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)   
 Exelon and the Utility Registrants account for their regulated electric and gas operations in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires
Exelon and the Utility Registrants to reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements. This guidance is applicable to entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established
or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities  cost of providing services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates are set at levels that will recover the entities  costs
from customers. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent (1) the excess recovery of costs or accrued
credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. As of December 31, 2016, Exelon
and the Utility Registrants have concluded that the operations of each such Registrant meet the criteria to apply the authoritative guidance. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of operations no longer meets the criteria
of this guidance, Exelon and the Utility Registrants would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and could
be material. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities tables of Exelon and the Utility
Registrants.    For each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, Exelon and the Utility Registrants assess whether the regulatory
assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory
treatment for similar costs in each Registrant s jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. Furthermore, each Registrant makes other judgments related to the financial statement impact of
their regulatory environments, such as the types of adjustments to rate base that will be acceptable to regulatory bodies, if any, for which costs will be recoverable through rates. Refer to the revenue recognition discussion below for additional
information on the annual revenue reconciliations associated with ComEd s distribution formula rate, pursuant to EIMA, and FERC-approved

transmission formula rate tariffs for ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE. Additionally, estimates are made in accordance with the authoritative guidance for contingencies as to the amount of revenues
billed under certain regulatory orders that may ultimately be refunded to customers upon finalization of applicable regulatory or judicial processes. These assessments are based, to the extent possible, on past relevant experience with regulatory
bodies in each Registrant s jurisdictions, known circumstances specific to a particular matter and hearings held with the applicable regulatory body. If the assessments and estimates made by Exelon and the Utility Registrants for regulatory
assets and regulatory liabilities are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact on their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be material.  
 ACE has a recovery mechanism for purchased power costs associated with BGS. ACE records a deferred energy supply costs regulatory asset or regulatory
liability for under or over-recovered costs that are expected to be recovered from or refunded to ACE customers, respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, ACE changed its method of accounting for determining under or over-recovered costs in this
recovery mechanism to include unbilled revenues in the determination of under or over-recovered costs. ACE believes this change is preferable as it better reflects the economic impacts of   dollar-for-dollar   cost recovery mechanisms. ACE applied the change retrospectively. The impact of the change was a $12 million reduction to ACE s opening Retained earnings as of January 1, 2014
with a corresponding reduction to Regulatory assets. The impact of the change on Net income attributable to common shareholder was an increase of $2 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31,
2014, respectively.    The Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the
financial statements as a  non-recognized  subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.  
  Accounting for Derivative Instruments (All Registrants)     The
Registrants utilize derivative instruments to manage their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, changes in interest rates related to planned future debt issuances and changes in the fair value of outstanding debt. Generation uses a variety of
derivative and  non-derivative  instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power sales, fuel and energy purchases and other energy-related products marketed
and purchased. Additionally, Generation enters into energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. ComEd has entered into contracts to procure energy, capacity and ancillary services. In addition, ComEd currently holds   floating-to-fixed   energy swaps with several unaffiliated suppliers that extend into 2032. PECO and BGE have entered into derivative natural gas contracts to hedge their
long-term price risk in the natural gas market. PECO has also entered into derivative contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive RFP process as outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. BGE has also entered into derivative
contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive auction process as outlined in its MDPSC-approved SOS Program. Pepco has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the
MDPSC and DCPSC. DPL has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and the DPSC. DPL also uses derivatives to reduce natural gas commodity volatility and to limit its
customers  exposure to natural gas price fluctuations under a hedging program approved by the DPSC. ACE has contracts to procure BGS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. ComEd, PECO,
BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE do not enter into derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. The Registrants  derivative activities are in accordance with Exelon s Risk Management Policy (RMP). See Note 13 Derivative Financial
Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  derivative instruments.  
      116  

Table of Contents  

  The Registrants account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance.
Determining whether or not a contract qualifies as a derivative under this guidance requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlyings
and one or more notional amounts. Changes in management s assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets, and changes in authoritative guidance related to derivatives, could result in previously excluded contracts being subject to
the provisions of the authoritative derivative guidance. Generation has determined that contracts to purchase uranium, contracts to purchase and sell capacity in certain ISO s, certain emission products and RECs do not meet the definition of a
derivative under the current authoritative guidance since they do not provide for net settlement and neither the uranium, certain capacity, emission nor the REC markets are sufficiently liquid to conclude that physical forward contracts are readily
convertible to cash. If these markets do become sufficiently liquid in the future and Generation would be required to account for these contracts as derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would be accounted for consistent with
Generation s other derivative instruments. In this case, if market prices differ from the underlying prices of the contracts, Generation would be required to record
  mark-to-market   gains or losses, which may have a significant impact to Exelon s and Generation s financial positions and results of operations.  
 Under current authoritative guidance, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for certain derivatives that
qualify for, and are elected under, the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in fair
values for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the hedged cash flows of the
underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated OCI and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. Generally, hedge
accounting is not elected for commodity transactions. Economic hedges for commodities are recorded at fair value through earnings. In addition, for energy-related derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, changes in the fair value
of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. For economic hedges that are not designated for hedge accounting for the Utility Registrants, changes in the fair value each period are recorded with a corresponding offsetting regulatory
asset or liability if there is an ability to recover the associated costs.      Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception    
 As part of Generation s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its
customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. While some of these
contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance, certain of these qualifying transactions have been designated as normal purchases and normal sales and are thus not required to be recorded at fair value,
but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. Determining whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires that management exercise judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that
management ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements. Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is
completed. Contracts which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are those for which physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time
and is not financially settled on a net basis. The contracts that ComEd has entered into with suppliers as part of ComEd s energy procurement process, PECO s full requirement contracts under the PAPUC-approved DSP

program, most of PECO s natural gas supply agreements, all of BGE s full requirement contracts and natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives and certain Pepco, DPL and ACE full
requirement contracts qualify for and are accounted for under the normal purchases and normal sales exception.      Commodity Contracts
     Identification of a commodity contract as an economic hedge requires Generation to determine that the contract is in accordance with the
RMP. Generation reassesses its economic hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guidelines of the RMP.    As a part
of accounting for derivatives, the Registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, load requirements, interest rates, the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows, the fair value of contracts and the
expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether or not to enter into derivative transactions, and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value
measurements, the Registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and  non-exchange-based  markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives  pricing
is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or   over-the-counter,    on-line  exchanges are categorized in
Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the  bid-ask   mid-point  prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most
liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction
volumes, market delivery points,  bid-ask  spreads and contract duration. The Registrant s derivatives are traded predominately at liquid trading points. The remaining derivative contracts are valued using
models that take into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, and assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in
liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, the model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, the model
inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes
assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. The Registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit
risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 1, 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. The impacts of credit and nonperformance risk to
date have generally not been material to the financial statements.      Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments    
 The Registrants may utilize   fixed-to-floating   interest rate swaps, which
are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve the targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt. Additionally, the Registrants may use forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to lock in
interest-rate levels in anticipation of future financings and floating to fixed swaps for project financing. In addition, Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate
component of commodity positions. The characterization of the interest rate derivative contracts between the economic hedge and proprietary trading activity is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that
gives rise to the interest rate exposure. Generation does not utilize interest rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or changes in market interest rates. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure
 
      118  

Table of Contents  

associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. The fair
value of the agreements is calculated by discounting the future net cash flows to the present value based on the terms and conditions of the agreements and the forward interest rate and foreign exchange curves. As these inputs are based on
observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are primarily categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain exchange based interest rate derivatives that are valued using
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.    See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK and Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
Registrants  derivative instruments.     Taxation (All Registrants)   
 Significant management judgment is required in determining the Registrants  provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to
tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a  two-step  approach including a  more-likely-than-not  recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely
of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not  more-likely-than-not  that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions
that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position,
assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax
benefits to be recorded in the Registrants  consolidated financial statements.    In the first quarter of 2016, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE changed
their accounting principle for classification of interest on uncertain tax positions. PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE have reclassified interest on uncertain tax positions as interest expense from income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income. GAAP does not address the preferability of one acceptable method of accounting over the other for the classification of interest on uncertain tax positions. However, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE believe this change is
preferable for comparability of their financial statements with the financial statements of the other Registrants in the combined filing, for consistency with FERC classification and for a more appropriate representation of the effective tax rate as
they manage the settlement of uncertain tax positions and interest expense separately. PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE applied the change retrospectively. The reclassification in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the
year ended December 31, 2015 is $34 million and $4 million for PHI and Pepco, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2014 is $1 million for both Pepco and ACE. The impact on all other PHI Registrants for years
ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 is less than $1 million.    The Registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of
realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Registrants also evaluate for negative evidence that
could indicate the Registrant s inability to realize its deferred tax assets, such as historical operating loss or tax credit carryforward expiration. Based on the combined assessment, the Registrants record valuation allowances for deferred
tax assets when they conclude it is  more-likely-than-not  such benefit will not be realized in future periods.  
      119  

Table of Contents  

  Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including
future changes in income tax laws, the Registrants  forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by
taxing authorities. While the Registrants believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could
result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to their consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding taxes.     Accounting for Loss Contingencies (All Registrants)   
 In the preparation of their financial statements, the Registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities
for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. The amounts recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. The estimates that the Registrants make in
accounting for loss contingencies and the actual results that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties could have a significant effect on their consolidated financial statements.  
   Environmental Costs      Environmental
investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the Registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared
with other parties, the timing of the remediation work and changes in technology, regulations and the requirements of local governmental authorities. Periodic studies are conducted at ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE to determine future
remediation requirements and estimates are adjusted accordingly. In addition, periodic reviews are performed at Generation to assess the adequacy of its environmental reserves. These matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate,
could have a significant effect on the Registrants  results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
     Other, Including Personal Injury Claims    
 The Registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers  compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that
losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. The Registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). The IBNR reserve is estimated based on
actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible
state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. Accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material effect on the Registrants  results
of operations, financial position and cash flows.     Revenue Recognition (All Registrants)   
   Sources of Revenue and Determination of Accounting Treatment    
 The Registrants earn revenues from various business activities including: the sale of energy and energy-related products, such as natural gas, capacity,
and other commodities in  non-regulated  markets (wholesale and retail) ;  the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas in regulated markets; and the provision of other energy-related  non-regulated  products and services.  
      120  

Table of Contents  

  The appropriate accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying
transaction and applicable accounting standards. The Registrants primarily use accrual and   mark-to-market   accounting as discussed in more detail below.  
   Accrual Accounting      Under accrual
accounting, the Registrants record revenues in the period when services are rendered or energy is delivered to customers. The Registrants generally use accrual accounting to recognize revenues for sales of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as part of their physical delivery activities. The Registrants enter into these sales transactions using a variety of instruments, including  non-derivative  agreements, derivatives that qualify for
and are designated as normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS) of commodities that will be physically delivered, sales to utility customers under regulated service tariffs and spot-market sales, including settlements with independent system
operators.        Mark-to-Market   Accounting    
 The Registrants record revenues and expenses using the   mark-to-market  
method of accounting for transactions that meet the definition of a derivative for which they are not permitted, or have not elected, the NPNS exception. These
  mark-to-market   transactions primarily relate to commodity price risk management activities.
  Mark-to-market   revenues and expenses include: inception gains or losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable and realized; and unrealized gains and
losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts.      Unbilled Revenues    
 The determination of Generation s and the Utility Registrants  retail energy sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of
customer meters generally on a monthly basis. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. The measurement of unbilled
revenue is affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. Increases or decreases in
volumes delivered to the utilities  customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, revenues may
fluctuate monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternate supplier, since unbilled commodity receivables are not recorded for these customers. Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers
scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged.  
 See Note 6 Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
   Regulated Distribution   Transmission Revenues    
 ComEd s EIMA distribution formula rate provides for annual reconciliations to the distribution revenue requirement. As of the balance sheet dates,
ComEd has recorded its best estimates of the distribution revenue impact resulting from changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC in accordance with the formula rate mechanism.  
 ComEd s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s FERC transmission formula rate tariffs provide for annual reconciliations to the
transmission revenue requirements. As of the balance sheet dates,  
      121  

Table of Contents  

ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE have recorded the best estimate of their respective transmission revenue impact resulting from changes in rates that each Registrant believes are probable of
approval by FERC in accordance with the formula rate mechanism.    Distribution and transmission formula rates require significant estimates.
Estimates are based upon actual costs incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated reconciliation can be
affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred, investments made, allowed ROE, and actions by regulators or courts.    See Note
1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the potential impacts of the new revenue accounting standard effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
December 15, 2017.     Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (All Registrants)   
 The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the Registrants  best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the
allowance is based on accounts receivable aging historical experience and other currently available information. ComEd, PECO and BGE estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed
specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. At December 31, 2015, Pepco, DPL and ACE estimated the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on specific identification of material amounts at
risk by customer and maintained a reserve based on their historical collection experience. At December 31, 2016, Pepco, DPL and ACE aligned the estimation of their allowance for uncollectible accounts to be consistent with ComEd, PECO and BGE,
as described above. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar credit quality indicators that are comprised based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the accounts
receivable balances are based on historical average charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. The Utility Registrant customers  accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by
the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. Utility Registrants  customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. Utility Registrants  allowances for uncollectible accounts
will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC and NJBPU regulations. See Note 6 Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding accounts receivable.        Results of Operations by Business Segment    
 The comparisons of operating results and other statistical information for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 set forth below include
intercompany transactions, which are eliminated in Exelon s consolidated financial statements.

(a) 
 On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, beginning on April 1, 2014, the financial results include CENG s results of operations on a fully
consolidated basis.    

(b) 
 Generation evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense. Generation believes that revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement
because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or
deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.        Net Income Attributable to Membership Interest
      Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  Generation s net
income attributable to membership interest decreased compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to lower revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, higher operating and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization
expense, and losses on sales of assets in 2016, partially offset by increased other income and decreased income tax expense. The decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense primarily relates to lower
  mark-to-market   results in 2016 compared to 2015 and lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the Ginna Reliability Support Services Agreement and a decrease in
outage days at higher capacity units despite an increase in overall outage days. The increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily related to the impairment of Upstream assets and certain wind projects, and increased costs related to
the implementation of the cost management program. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to accelerated depreciation and amortization expense related to the previous decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad
Cities nuclear generating facilities, increased nuclear decommissioning amortization and increased depreciation expense due to ongoing capital expenditures. The increase in losses on sales of assets is primarily due to Generation s strategic
decision to narrow the scope and scale of its growth and development activities. The increase in other income is primarily due to the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT funds.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014.  Generation s net income
attributable to membership interest increased compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to higher revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense and lower operating and maintenance expense; partially offset by the absence of the 2014 gains
recorded on the sales of Generation s ownership interest in generating stations, the absence of the 2014 gain recorded upon the consolidation of CENG, decreased other income and increased income tax expense. The increase in revenue, net of
purchase power and fuel expense was primarily due to the inclusion of CENG s results on fully consolidated basis in 2015, the benefit of lower cost to serve load (including the absence of higher procurement costs for replacement power in 2014),
the cancellation of the DOE SNF disposal fee, increased capacity prices, the inclusion of Integrys  results in 2015, favorability from portfolio management optimization activities, increased load served, and   mark-to-market   gains in 2015 compared to   mark-to-market   losses in 2014, partially offset by lower margins resulting from the
2014 sale of generating assets, lower realized energy prices, and the absence of the 2014 fuel optimization opportunities in the South region due to extreme cold weather. The decrease in operating and maintenance expense was largely due to the
reduction of long-lived asset impairment charges in 2015 versus 2014, partially offset by increased labor, contracting and materials expense due to the inclusion of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis in 2015 and increased energy
efficiency projects. The decrease in other income is primarily the result of the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT fund investments in 2015 as compared to 2014.

generation volumes due to the sale of generating assets.     Midwest. Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended
December     31, 2015 . The $79 million increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Midwest was primarily due to decreased nuclear outage days and decreased nuclear fuel prices.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The $293 million increase in
revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Midwest was primarily due to higher capacity revenues, increased load volumes served, the inclusion of Integrys  results in 2015, the cancellation of the DOE SNF disposal fee in 2014, and
favorability from portfolio management optimization activities, partially offset by lower nuclear volumes.     New England. Year Ended
December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015 . The $23 million decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in New England was primarily due to lower realized energy prices
and higher oil inventory write-downs in 2016, partially offset by increased capacity prices.     Year Ended December     31, 2015
Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The $110 million increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in New England was primarily due to the benefit of lower cost to serve load, increased load volumes
served, the inclusion of Integrys  results in 2015, and favorability from portfolio management optimization activities, partially offset by lower generation volumes due to the sale of a generating asset.  
  New York. Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  The $108 million
increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in New York was primarily due to the impact of the Ginna Reliability Support Service Agreement, partially offset by lower realized energy prices.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The $151 million increase in
revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in New York was primarily due to the inclusion of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis for the full year in 2015, increased nuclear volumes and the inclusion of Integrys  results in
2015, partially offset by lower realized energy prices and decreased capacity revenues.     ERCOT.     Year Ended
December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  The $12 million decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in ERCOT was primarily due to lower realized energy prices,
partially offset by increased output from renewable assets.     Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended
December     31, 2014.  The $24 million decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in ERCOT was primarily due to lower realized energy prices and a decrease in generation volumes due to the sale of a
generating asset, partially offset by the absence of higher procurement costs for replacement power in 2014 and decreased fuel costs.     Other
Power Regions. Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  The $86 million increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in Other Power Regions was primarily
due to higher realized energy prices.     Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31,
2014.  The $77 million decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in Other Power Regions was primarily  
      128  

Table of Contents  

due to the amortization of contracts recorded at fair value associated with prior acquisitions, lower realized energy prices, the absence of the 2014 fuel optimization opportunities, partially
offset by increased generation from power purchase agreements, and decreased fuel costs.     Proprietary Trading. Year Ended
December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  The $14 million increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in Proprietary trading was primarily due to congestion activity.
    Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014.  The $41 million decrease
in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in Proprietary trading was primarily due to the absence of gains on congestion trading products.  
    Mark-to-market.    Generation is exposed to market risks associated
with changes in commodity prices and enters into economic hedges to mitigate exposure to these fluctuations. See Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on gains and losses associated with   mark-to-market   derivatives.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015 .   Mark-to-market   losses on economic hedging activities were $41 million in 2016 compared to gains of $257 million in 2015.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 .   Mark-to-market   gains on economic hedging activities were $257 million in 2015 compared to losses of $591 million in 2014.  
  Other. Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  The $107 million
increase in other revenue net of purchased power and fuel was primarily due to revenue related to the inclusion of Pepco Energy Services results in 2016 and revenue related to energy efficiency projects, partially offset by the amortization of
energy contracts recorded at fair value associated with prior acquisitions, and accelerated nuclear fuel amortization associated with the initial early retirement decision for Clinton and Quad Cities as discussed in Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant
Retirements of the Combined Notes to the Financial Statements.     Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended
December     31, 2014.  The $246 million increase in other revenue net of purchased power and fuel was primarily due to the amortization of energy contracts recorded at fair value associated with prior acquisitions, the
inclusion of Integrys  gas results in 2015, and an increase in distributed generation and energy efficiency activity. See Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding energy
contract intangibles.      Nuclear Fleet Capacity Factor    
 The following table presents nuclear fleet operating data for 2016, as compared to 2015 and 2014, for the Generation-operated plants. The nuclear fleet
capacity factor presented in the table is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated at full average annual mean capacity for that time period. Generation considers capacity
factor a useful measure to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods. Generation has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not a
presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or be more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.

Table of Contents  

   Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31,
2015 . The nuclear fleet capacity factor, which excludes Salem, increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to fewer refueling and  non-refueling  outage days. For 2016 and 2015, planned refueling outage
days totaled 245 and 290, respectively, and  non-refueling  outage days totaled 63 and 82, respectively.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The nuclear fleet capacity factor,
which excludes Salem, decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a higher number of refueling outage days and  non-outage  energy losses, partially offset by a lower number of unplanned outage days. For
2015 and 2014, planned refueling outage days totaled 290 and 275, respectively, and  non-refueling  outage days totaled 82 and 92, respectively.

  Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015 . Depreciation and amortization expense
increased primarily due to accelerated depreciation and increased nuclear decommissioning amortization related to the previous decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear facilities in 2016, and increased depreciation expense due to
ongoing capital expenditures.    Excluding the impacts of future capital additions, Generation expects total annual depreciation for Clinton and Quad
Cities in 2017 and future years will be consistent with the annual depreciation recognized prior to the June 2016 early retirement decision, with the impact on prospective depreciation of the reduction in the plants  book values as a result of
the accelerated depreciation recorded from June 2, 2016 to December 6, 2016, being essentially offset by the impact of shortening Clinton s expected economic useful life from the original 2046 date to the now expected 2027 date.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The increase in depreciation and
amortization expense was primarily due to the inclusion of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis in 2015, increased nuclear decommissioning amortization, and an increase in ongoing capital expenditures.  
   Taxes Other Than Income       Year Ended
December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015 . The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to an increase in gross receipts tax.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The increase in taxes other than

    Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Affiliates    
  Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015 . The year-over-year change in Equity
in losses of unconsolidated affiliates is primarily the result of increased losses on equity investments.     Year Ended
December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The year-over-year change in Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates is primarily the result of the consolidation of CENG s results of
operations beginning April 1, 2014, which were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting.      Gain (Loss) on Sales of
Assets       Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015 . The decrease in
gain (loss) on sales of assets is primarily related to the  one-time  recognition for a loss on sale of assets pursuant to Generation s strategic decision in the fourth quarter of 2016 to narrow the scope
and scale of its growth and development activities, partially offset by a gain associated with Generation s sale of the retired New Boston generating site in 2016.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The decrease in gain (loss) on sales
of assets is primarily related to the absence of $411 million of gains recorded on the sale of Generation s ownership interests in Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation, Fore River and West Valley generating stations in 2014. Refer to Note
4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.      Gain on
Consolidation and Acquisition of Businesses       Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended
December     31, 2014 . The decrease in gain on consolidation and acquisition of businesses reflects the absence of a $261 million gain upon consolidation of CENG resulting from the difference in fair value of CENG s net
assets as of April 1, 2014 and the equity method investment previously recorded on Generation s and Exelon s books and the settlement of  pre-existing  transactions between Generation and CENG
recorded in 2014, and the absence of a $28 million bargain-purchase gain related to the Integrys acquisition recorded in 2014.      Interest

respectively, related to the contractual elimination of income tax expense associated with the NDT fund investments of the Regulatory Agreement Units. Refer to Note 16 Asset Retirement
Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding NDT fund investments.     Year Ended
December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014 . The decrease in Other, net primarily reflects the net decrease in realized and unrealized gains related to the NDT fund investments of
Generation s  Non-Regulatory  Agreement Units as described in the table below. Other, net also reflects $(22) million and $67 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, related to the contractual elimination of income tax expense associated with the NDT fund investments of the Regulatory Agreement Units. Refer to Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding NDT fund investments.    The following table provides unrealized and realized gains (losses) on the
NDT fund investments of the  Non-Regulatory  Agreement Units recognized in Other, net for 2016, 2015 and 2014:      
     Effective Income Tax Rate.    
 Generation s effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 33.2%, 27.1% and 16.9%, respectively. See

    Results of Operations ComEd       
 
      133  

Table of Contents  

(a) 
 ComEd evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Revenue net of purchased power expense. ComEd believes that Revenue net of purchased power expense is a useful measurement because it provides information
that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. In general, ComEd only earns margin based on the delivery and transmission of electricity. ComEd has included its discussion of Revenue net of purchased power expense below as a complement to
the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, Revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP
information provided elsewhere in this report.    

(b) 
 For regulatory recovery mechanisms, including ComEd s electric distribution and transmission formula rates, and riders, revenues increase and decrease i) as fully recoverable costs fluctuate (with no impact on net
earnings), and ii) pursuant to changes in rate base, capital structure and ROE (which impact net earnings).        Net Income
      Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  ComEd s Net income
for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower than the same period in 2015 primarily due to the recognition of the penalty and the  after-tax  interest related to the Tax Court s decision on
Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position, partially offset by increased electric distribution and transmission formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment, partially offset by lower allowed electric
distribution ROE) and favorable weather.     Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31,
2014.  ComEd s Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was higher than the same period in 2014 primarily due to increased electric distribution and transmission formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of increased capital
investment, partially offset by lower allowed electric distribution ROE), partially offset by unfavorable weather and volume.      Revenues Net of
Purchased Power Expense      There are certain drivers of Operating revenues that are fully offset by their impact on Purchased power expense,
such as commodity procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. ComEd is permitted to recover electricity procurement costs from retail customers without  mark-up.  Therefore, fluctuations in
electricity procurement costs have no impact on Revenue net of purchased power expense. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ComEd s electricity procurement
process.    All ComEd customers have the choice to purchase electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier. Customer choice programs do
not impact ComEd s volume of deliveries, but do affect ComEd s Operating revenues related to supplied energy, which is fully offset in Purchased power expense. Therefore, customer choice programs have no impact on Revenue net of purchased
power expense.    Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kWh sales) for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, consisted of the following:      
   Retail customers purchasing electric generation from competitive electric generation suppliers at December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following:

  Under an Illinois law allowing municipalities to arrange the purchase of electricity for their
participating residents, the City of Chicago previously participated in ComEd s customer choice program and arranged the purchase of electricity from Constellation (formerly Integrys), for those participating residents. In September 2015,
the City of Chicago discontinued its participation in the customer choice program and many of those participating residents resumed their purchase of electricity from ComEd. ComEd s Operating revenues has increased as a result of the City of
Chicago switching, but that increase is fully offset in Purchased power expense.    The changes in ComEd s Revenue net of purchased power expense
for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, consisted of the following:  
   
    Weather.  The demand for electricity is affected by weather conditions. Very warm weather in summer months and
very cold weather in other months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased customer usage. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. For the year ended December 31, 2016,
favorable weather conditions increased Operating revenues net of purchased power expense when compared to the prior years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, unfavorable weather conditions reduced Operating revenues net of purchased power
expense when compared to the prior years.    Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to
heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a  30-year  period in ComEd s service territory with cooling degree days
generally having a more significant impact to ComEd, particularly during the summer months. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in ComEd s service territory for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the
following:      
 
      135  

Table of Contents  

   Volume.  Revenue net of purchased power expense remained relatively consistent as a result of
delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting a consistent average usage per residential customer as compared to the same period in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015,
Revenue net of purchased power expense decreased as a result of lower delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, reflecting decreased average usage per residential customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, as compared to the
same period in 2014.     Electric Distribution Revenue.  EIMA provides for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual
reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Under EIMA, electric distribution revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the
underlying costs, investments being recovered and allowed ROE. ComEd s allowed ROE is the annual average rate on  30-year  treasury notes plus 580 basis points, subject to a collar of plus or minus 50 basis
points. Therefore, the collar limits favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and load on revenue. In addition, ComEd s allowed ROE is subject to reduction if ComEd does not deliver the reliability and customer service benefits to which it
has committed over the  ten-year  life of the investment program. During the year ended December 31, 2016, electric distribution revenue increased $69 million, primarily due to increased capital
investment and depreciation expense, partially offset by lower allowed ROE due to a decrease in treasury rates. During the year ended December 31, 2015, electric distribution revenue increased $180 million, primarily due to higher
Operating and maintenance expense and increased capital investment, partially offset by lower allowed ROE due to decreased treasury rates. See Operating and Maintenance Expense below and Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     Transmission Revenue.  Under a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue
varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in January based on the prior calendar year. Generally, increases/decreases in the
highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, ComEd recorded increased transmission revenue due to increased capital investment, higher depreciation expense and
increased highest daily peak load. See Operating and Maintenance Expense below and Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
  Regulatory Required Programs.  This represents the change in Operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for
regulatory programs such as ComEd s energy efficiency and demand response and purchased power administrative costs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery. An equal and offsetting amount has been included in Operating
and maintenance expense. See Operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.     Uncollectible
Accounts Recovery, Net.  Uncollectible accounts recovery, net, represents recoveries under ComEd s uncollectible accounts tariff. See Operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on this tariff.  
  Pricing and Customer Mix.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the increase in Revenue net of purchased power as a result of pricing and
customer mix is primarily attributable to higher overall effective rates due to decreased usage across all major customer classes and change in customer mix. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the decrease in Revenue net of purchased power
as a result of pricing and customer mix is primarily attributable to lower overall effective rates due to increased usage across all major customer classes and change in customer mix.

evaluate its net revenue from operations. PECO has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, revenue net of purchased
power expense and revenue net of fuel expense figures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.
        Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholder    
  Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  PECO s net income attributable
to common shareholder for the year ended December 31, 2016 was higher than the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in Revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of increased electric distribution revenue pursuant
to the 2015 PAPUC authorized electric distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2016.     Year Ended December     31, 2015
Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014.  PECO s net income attributable to common shareholder for the year ended December 31, 2015 was higher than the same period in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in Operating
and maintenance expense due to a decrease in storm costs.      Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense    
 Electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. PECO s electric
supply and natural gas cost rates charged to customers are subject to adjustments as specified in the PAPUC-approved tariffs that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of electric supply and natural gas and the
amount included in rates in accordance with PECO s GSA and PGC, respectively. Therefore, fluctuations in electric supply and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on electric and natural gas revenues net of purchased power and fuel
expense.    Electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the Customer
Choice Program. All PECO customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. The customer s choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of
deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service. Customer Choice Program activity has no impact on electric and natural gas revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense.  
 Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kWh and mmcf sales, respectively) for the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 consisted of the following:

  The changes in PECO s Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisted of the following:      
    Weather.  The demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather conditions. With respect to the
electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions
result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was reduced by the impact of unfavorable
weather conditions in PECO s service territory.    Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended
December 31, 2015, was higher primarily due to the impact of favorable 2015 summer and first quarter winter weather conditions, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable fourth quarter 2015 winter weather conditions in PECO s service
territory.    Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business.
Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a  30-year  period in PECO s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in PECO s
service territory for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:  

Volume.  The increase in Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume,
exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives on customer usages for gas and
residential and small commercial and industrial electric classes. Additionally, the increase represents a shift in the volume profile across classes from large commercial and industrial classes to residential and small commercial and industrial
classes for electric.  
      142  

Table of Contents  

   Pricing.  The increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense as a result of
pricing for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects an increase in electric distribution rates charged to customers. The increase in electric distribution rates was effective January 1, 2016 in accordance with the 2015 PAPUC approved
electric distribution rate case settlement. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for further information.    The increase in electric operating revenues
net of purchased power expense as a result of pricing for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to increased monthly customer demand in the commercial and industrial classes. The increase in natural gas operating revenues
net of fuel expense as a result of pricing for the year ended December 31, 2015, is primarily attributable to higher overall effective rates due to decreased retail gas usage.  
  Regulatory Required Programs.  This represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for
regulatory programs such as smart meter, energy efficiency and the GSA. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The costs of these programs are included in Operating and maintenance expense,
Depreciation and amortization expense and Income taxes. Refer to the Operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.

 Taxes other than income, which can vary year to year, include municipal and state utility taxes, real estate taxes, and payroll taxes. Taxes other than
income increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an increase in gross receipts tax driven by increases in electric revenue, which was impacted primarily by the new distribution rates
that went into effect in January 2016 .    Taxes other than income remained relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared
to the same period in 2014.      Interest Expense, Net

     Results of Operations BGE   

(a) 
 BGE evaluates its operating performance using the measures of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales and revenue net of fuel expense for gas sales. BGE believes revenues net of purchased power and
fuel expense are useful measurements of its performance because they provide information that can be used to evaluate its net revenue from operations. BGE has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in
accordance with GAAP. However, revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense figures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided
elsewhere in this report.        Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholder    
  Year Ended December     31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  Net income attributable to common
shareholder was higher primarily due to lower income tax expense and decreased preference stock dividends partially offset by slightly lower operating income. The lower income tax expense was driven by a
 one-time  adjustment associated with transmission-related regulatory assets. The slight decrease in operating income was driven by an increase in Operating and maintenance expense as a result of cost
disallowances which reduced certain regulatory assets and other long-lived assets stemming from the distribution rate orders issued by the MDPSC in June 2016 and July 2016 and increased storm costs. This increase in Operating and maintenance expense
was offset by an increase in Revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, primarily as a result of an increase in transmission formula rate revenues and higher electric and natural gas revenues as a result of the distribution rate orders issued
by the MDPSC in June 2016 and July 2016.

Table of Contents  

   Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31,
2014.  Net income attributable to common shareholder was higher primarily due to an increase in Revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of the December 2014 electric and natural gas distribution rate order issued by the
MDPSC, an increase in transmission formula rate revenues and a reduction in Operating and maintenance expense as a result of a decrease in bad debt expense and storm costs in the BGE service territory.  
   Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense    
 There are certain drivers to Operating revenues that are offset by their impact on Purchased power and fuel expense, such as commodity procurement costs
and programs allowing customers to select a competitive electric or natural gas supplier. Operating revenues and Purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. BGE s electric and natural gas rates
charged to customers are subject to periodic adjustments that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased electric power and purchased natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with the
MDPSC s market-based SOS and gas commodity programs, respectively.    Electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are
also affected by fluctuations in the number of customers electing to use a competitive electric generation or natural gas supplier. All BGE customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and
natural gas suppliers, respectively. This customers  choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but does affect revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service.  
 Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kWh and mmcf sales, respectively) at
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following:

  The changes in BGE s Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, respectively, consisted of the following:  
   
    Distribution Rate Increase.  The increase in distribution revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 was
primarily due to the impact of the new electric and natural gas distribution rates charged to customers that became effective in June 2016 in accordance with the MDPSC approved electric and natural gas distribution rate case orders in June 2016 and
July 2016. The increase in distribution revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric and natural gas distribution rates charged to customers that became effective in December 2014 in
accordance with the MDPSC approved electric and natural gas distribution rate case order. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
  Revenue Decoupling.  The demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather and usage conditions. The MDPSC allows BGE to record a
monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas distribution revenue from all residential customers, commercial electric customers, the majority of large industrial electric customers, and all firm service natural gas customers to eliminate the
effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on BGE s electric and natural gas distribution volumes, thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenue per customer, by customer class, regardless of changes in
actual consumption levels. This allows BGE to recognize revenue at MDPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what BGE s actual distribution volumes were for a billing period. Therefore, while this revenue is affected by customer growth
(i.e., increase in the number of customers), it will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions (i.e., changes in consumption per customer). BGE bills or credits customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue
levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings.    Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for
energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a  30-year  period in BGE s service territory. The changes in
heating and cooling degree days in BGE s service territory for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, respectively, and normal
weather consisted of the following:

   Regulatory Required Programs.  This represents the change in revenue collected under approved riders
to recover costs incurred for the energy efficiency and demand response programs. The riders are designed to provide full recovery, as well as a return in certain instances. The costs of these programs are included in Operating and maintenance
expense, Depreciation and amortization expense and Taxes other than income in BGE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
  Transmission Revenue.  Under a FERC approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying
costs, investments being recovered and other billing determinants. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the increase in transmission revenue was primarily due to increases in rates to reflect capital investment and operating and
maintenance expense recoveries. See Operating and Maintenance Expense below and Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
  Other, Net.  Other net revenue, which can vary from period to period, includes commodity electric and gas revenue and other miscellaneous revenue
such as service application and late payment fees; partially offset by commodity electric and gas purchased fuel and energy.      Operating and

     On September 23, 2015, the Baltimore City Board of Estimates approved an increase in annual rental fees for access to the
Baltimore City underground conduit system effective November 1, 2015, from $12 million to $42 million, subject to an annual increase thereafter based on the Consumer Price Index. BGE subsequently entered into litigation with the City
regarding the amount of and basis for establishing the conduit fee. On November 30, 2016, the Baltimore City Board of Estimates approved a settlement agreement entered into between BGE and the City to resolve the disputes and pending litigation
related to BGE s use of and payment for the underground conduit system. As a result of the settlement, the parties have entered into a  six-year  lease that reduces the annual expense to $25 million in
the first three years and caps the annual expense in the last three years to not more than $29 million. BGE recorded a credit to Operating and maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of

   Predecessor Period Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014    
 PHI s net income attributable to common shareholders was $327 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to
$242 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.      Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense    
 Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a  non-GAAP  measure discussed above,
increased by $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is attributable to the following factors:  

Increase of $90 million at Pepco primarily related to electric distribution revenue increases totaling $46 million due to electric distribution base rate increases in the District of Columbia effective April
2014 and in Maryland effective July 2014 and customer growth, $34 million in required regulatory programs primarily due to EmPower Maryland rate increases effective February 2015 and 2014, and $10 million higher transmission revenue due to
higher rates effective June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2014.        

Increase of $26 million at DPL primarily related to electric distribution revenue increases totaling $7 million due to higher weather-related sales and customer growth, $17 million in required regulatory
programs primarily due to EmPower Maryland rate increases effective February 2015 and 2014, and $7 million higher transmission revenue due to higher rates effective June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2014, partially offset by lower natural gas
distribution revenues totaling $5 million due to milder weather.        

Increase of $41 million at ACE primarily related to electric distribution revenue increases totaling $26 million due to an electric distribution rate increase effective September 2014 and higher
weather-related sales and $15 million in required regulatory programs.        

Decrease of $47 million at PES primarily related to lower energy efficiency construction activity in 2015.

    Operating and Maintenance Expense    
 Operating and maintenance expense decreased by $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2014. The decrease is attributable to the following factors:      

Increase of $107 million at Pepco, DPL and ACE primarily due to higher labor, contracting and material costs related to the implementation of a new customer information system in 2015, increased bad debt expense,
higher tree-trimming and system maintenance costs, higher customer service costs, and higher environmental remediation costs.        

Decrease of $118 million at PES primarily due to 2014 impairment losses associated with its combined heat and power thermal generating facilities and operations in Atlantic City.    

Decrease of $15 million at Corporate due primarily to lower Merger-related transaction and integration costs.    
   Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense    
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased by $98 million primarily due to an increase of $48 million associated with EmPower
Maryland surcharge rate increases effective February 2015 and February 2014, higher depreciation of $23 million due to  on-going  capital expenditures at Pepco, DPL, and ACE, an increase of $15 million
in the amortization of stranded costs, primarily as the result of higher revenue due to a rate increase effective October 2014 for the ACE Market Transition Tax and an increase of $10 million in amortization of software, primarily related to
the implementation of a new customer information system.      Taxes Other Than Income    
 Taxes other than income increased by $18 million primarily due to higher property taxes related to an increase in assets.  
   (Loss) gain on Sale of Assets      (Loss)
gain on sale of assets increased by $46 million due to 2015 gains recorded at Pepco associated with the sale of unimproved land, held as  non-utility  property.  
   Interest Expense, Net      Interest
expense increased by $11 million due to higher long-term and short-term debt.      Other, Net    
 Other, net increased by $44 million due to $33 million of interest income on uncertain tax positions from the PHI Global Tax Settlement and an
increase in income of $15 million due to an increase in the fair value of the derivative related to preferred stock.      Effective Income
Tax Rate      PHI s effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were 33.9% and 36.3%,
respectively. See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.

     Results of Operations Pepco   

(a) 
 Pepco evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales. Pepco believes revenue net of purchased power expense is a useful measurement because it provides
information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Pepco has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, Revenue net of purchased power expense is not a
presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.    
   Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholder    
  Year Ended December     31, 2016   Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  Pepco s net income
attributable to common shareholder for the year ended December 31, 2016, was lower than the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in Operating and maintenance expense due to merger-related costs.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014.  The increase in net income
attributable to common shareholder was driven primarily by an increase in gains recorded from the sale of certain Pepco properties in 2015 and higher Operating revenues net of purchased power expense resulting from customer growth and electric
distribution base rate increases in 2014 in the District of Columbia and Maryland, partially offset by an increase in Operating and maintenance expense primarily due to the implementation of a new customer information system and higher maintenance
expense.      Revenues Net of Purchased Power Expense    
 Operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity to Pepco s customers within its service territories at regulated
rates. Operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC-approved formula methodology.  
      157

  Electric revenues and purchased power expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the
Customer Choice Program. All Pepco customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. The customers  choice of supplier does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from
customers related to supplied energy service.    Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kWh
sales) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively , consisted of the following:      
   Retail customers purchasing electric generation from competitive electric generation suppliers at December 31,
2016, 2015, and 2014 consisted of the following:      
   Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 73% of Pepco s retail kWh
sales to the District of Columbia customers and 59% of Pepco s retail kWh sales to Maryland customers for the year ended December 31, 2016 ; 71% of Pepco s retail kWh sales to the District of Columbia customers and 60% of Pepco s
retail kWh sales to Maryland customers for the year ended December 31, 2015; and 73% of Pepco s retail kWh sales to the District of Columbia customers and 59% of Pepco s retail kWh sales to Maryland customers for year ended
December 31, 2014.    The costs related to default electricity supply are included in Purchased power expense. Operating revenues also include
transmission enhancement credits that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM in consideration for approved regional transmission expansion plan expenditures.  
 Operating revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price
regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.  
 Purchased power expense consists of the cost of electricity purchased by Pepco to fulfill its default electricity supply obligation and, as such, is
recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders.    The changes in Pepco s operating revenues net of
purchased power expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisted of the following:      
 
      158  

Table of Contents  

   Revenue Decoupling.  Pepco s results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher
revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. For retail customers of Pepco in Maryland and in the District of Columbia, revenues are not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder weather because a bill stabilization adjustment
(BSA) for retail customers was implemented that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer. The BSA has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the
period. As a result, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from customers in Maryland and the District of Columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution
charge per customer. Changes in customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue for customers to whom the BSA applies.  
 In accounting for the BSA in Maryland and the District of Columbia, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive
adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland and the District of Columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a
negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer.  
 Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is
determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a  20-year  period in Pepco s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in Pepco s service territory
for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 compared to same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:      
    Volume.  The increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume,
exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth. The increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and
fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth.  
  Pricing Distribution Revenues.  The increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense as a result of pricing for the
year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to customers in Maryland that became effective in November 2016. The increase in distribution
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to customers in the District of Columbia effective April 2014 and in Maryland
effective July 2014. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

   Regulatory Required Programs.  This represents the change in operating revenues collected under
approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The costs of these programs are included in operating and
maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. Refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.  
  Transmission Revenues  .  Under a FERC approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the
underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing determinants. Transmission revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower revenue related to the MAPP abandonment recovery
period that ended in March 2016, partially offset by higher rates effective June 1, 2016 and June 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses. Transmission revenue increased for the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to higher rates effective June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2014 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses, partially offset by the establishment of a
reserve related to the FERC ROE challenges in 2015.      Operating and Maintenance Expense    

(a) 
 Operating and maintenance expenses for regulatory required programs are costs for various legislative and/or regulatory programs that are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated
rates. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in Operating revenues.

    Gain on Sales of Assets    
 Gain on Sale of Assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 decreased primarily due to higher gains recorded in
2015 at Pepco associated with the sale of land held as  non-utility  property. Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 increased primarily due to 2015
gains recorded at Pepco associated with the sale of land.      Interest Expense, Net    
 Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to the recording of interest
expense for an uncertain tax position in 2016, partially offset by an increase in capitalized AFUDC debt. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 increased primarily due to higher long-term
debt interest expense.      Other, Net    
 Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to higher income from AFUDC equity.
Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 decreased primarily due to gains recorded in 2014 associated with condemnation awards for certain transmission property, partially offset by higher income from
AFUDC equity.      Effective Income Tax Rate    
 Pepco s effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 49.4%, 35.3%, and 35.2%, respectively. See Note
15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the change in effective income tax rates. As a result of the merger, Pepco recorded an  after-tax  charge of $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the assessment and remeasurement of certain federal and state uncertain tax positions.

    Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholder    
  Year Ended December     31, 2016   Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  The decrease in net income
attributable to common shareholder was driven primarily by an increase in Operating and maintenance expense primarily due to merger-related costs.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014.  The decrease in net income
attributable to common shareholder was driven primarily by an increase in Operating and maintenance expense primarily due to the implementation of a new customer information system, higher bad debt expense and higher tree trimming and system
maintenance costs, partially offset by higher Operating revenues net of purchased power expense resulting from customer growth and higher transmission revenue.  
   Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense    
 Operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity to DPL s customers within its service territories at regulated
rates. Operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC-approved formula methodology.  
 Electric and gas revenues and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the Customer Choice Program. All
DPL customers have the choice to purchase electricity and gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. The customers  choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue
collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service.    Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and
natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kWh and mmcf sales, respectively) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, consisted of the following:      
   Retail customers purchasing electric generation and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas
suppliers at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 consisted of the following:      
   Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 53% of DPL s retail kWh
sales to Delaware customers and 48% of DPL retail kWh sales to Maryland customers for the year ended December 31, 2016; 53% of DPL s retail kWh sales to Delaware customers and 47% of DPL s retail kWh sales to Maryland customers for
the year ended December 31, 2015; and 56% of DPL s retail kWh sales to Delaware customers and 49% of DPL s retail kWh sales to Maryland customers for the year ended December 31, 2014.  
 The costs related to default electricity supply are included in Purchased power and fuel. Operating revenues also include transmission enhancement
credits that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM in consideration for approved regional transmission expansion plan expenditures.  
      164  

Table of Contents  

  Operating revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other
utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.  
 Natural Gas operating revenues includes sources that are subject to price regulation (Regulated Gas Revenue) and those that generally are not subject to
price regulation (Other Gas Revenue). Regulated gas revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from  on-system  natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service
territory at regulated rates. Other gas revenue consists of  off-system  natural gas sales and the short-term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers.  Off-system  sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity.  
 Purchased power consists of the cost of electricity purchased by DPL to fulfill its default electricity supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable
from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased fuel consists of the cost of gas purchased by DPL to fulfill its obligation to regulated gas customers and, as such, is recoverable from customers in
accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. It also includes the cost of gas purchased for  off-system  sales.  
 The changes in DPL s operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the
same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisted of the following:      
    Revenue Decoupling.  DPL s results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and
income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. For retail customers of DPL in Maryland, revenues are not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder weather because a bill stabilization adjustment (BSA) for retail customers was implemented
that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer. The BSA has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. As a result, the only factors that will
cause distribution revenue from customers in Maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. A modified fixed variable rate design, which would provide
for a charge not tied to a customer s volumetric consumption of electricity or natural gas, has been proposed for DPL electricity and natural gas customers in Delaware. Changes in customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy
efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue for customers to whom the BSA applies.  
 In accounting for the BSA in Maryland, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the
amount by which revenue from Maryland retail  
      165  

Table of Contents  

distribution sales falls short of the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which
revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer.  
  Weather.  The demand for electricity and gas in areas not subject to the BSA is affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric
business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased
deliveries of electricity and gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. During the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, weather was not a significant impact. During the year ended December 31, 2015 compared
to the same period in 2014, operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense was higher due to the impact of favorable spring and summer weather conditions in DPL s Delaware electric service territory and lower due to the impact of
warmer weather during the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to 2014, in DPL s natural gas service territory.    Heating and cooling degree days
are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a  20-year 
period in DPL s electric service territory and a  30-year  period in DPL s gas service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in DPL s service territory for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 compared to same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:      
     
    Volume.  The increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume,
exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth. The increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and

  Pricing Distribution Revenues.  The increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense as a result of pricing for the
year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution and natural gas rates charged to customers that became effective in July 2016. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters
of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     Regulatory Required Programs.  This represents the
change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The costs of
these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. Refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.

   Transmission Revenues.  Under a FERC approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year
based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing determinants. Transmission revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to higher rates effective
June 1, 2016 and June 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses, partially offset by lower revenue related to the MAPP abandonment recovery period that ended in March 2016. Transmission revenue
increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to higher rates effective June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2014 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses, partially
offset by the establishment of a reserve related to the FERC ROE challenges in 2015.      Operating and Maintenance Expense    

(a) 
 Operating and maintenance expenses for regulatory required programs are costs for various legislative and/or regulatory programs that are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated
rates. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in Operating revenues.      The changes in operating and maintenance expense for
2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014 consisted of the following:

    Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense    
 The changes in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014 consisted of the following:  

(a) 
 Depreciation expense increased due to ongoing capital expenditures.    

(b) 
 Regulatory asset amortization increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an EmPower Maryland surcharge rate increase effective February 2016, partially
offset by lower amortization of MAPP abandonment costs and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to an EmPower Maryland surcharge rate increase effective February 2015.    
   Taxes Other Than Income      Taxes other
than income for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to higher property taxes in Maryland related to higher property assessments and rate increases. Taxes other than income for the year

        Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholder    
  Year Ended December     31, 2016   Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2015.  The decrease in net income
attributable to common shareholder was driven primarily by an increase in Operating and maintenance expense primarily due to merger-related costs.  
  Year Ended December     31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December     31, 2014.  The decrease in net income
attributable to common shareholder was driven primarily by an increase in Operating and maintenance expense primarily due to the implementation of a new customer information system and higher storm restoration costs, partially offset by higher
Operating revenues net of purchased power expense resulting from an electric distribution base rate increase in 2014 in New Jersey.      Revenues
Net of Purchased Power Expense      Operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity to ACE s customers
within its service territories at regulated rates. Operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that ACE receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a
FERC-approved formula methodology.    Electric revenues and purchased power expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the Customer
Choice Program. All ACE customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. The customer s choice of supplier does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers
related to supplied energy service.    Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kWh sales) for
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, consisted of the following:      
   Retail customers purchasing electric generation from competitive electric generation suppliers at December 31,
2016, 2015, and 2014 consisted of the following:      
   The costs related to default electricity supply are included in Purchased power expense. Operating revenues also include
revenue from Transition Bond Charges that ACE receives, and pays to ACE Funding, to fund the principal and interest payments on Transition Bonds, revenue from the resale in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under contacts with
unaffiliated NUGs, and revenue from transmission enhancement credits.    Operating revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of
customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.

  Purchased power expense consists of the cost of electricity purchased by ACE to fulfill its default
electricity supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders.    The
changes in ACE s operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisted of the following:  
   
    Weather.  The demand for electricity is affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business,
very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity. Conversely, mild weather reduces
demand. During the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense was lower due to the impact of unfavorable winter weather conditions in ACE s service
territory. During the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense was higher due to the impact of favorable spring and summer weather conditions in ACE s
service territory.    For retail customers of ACE, distribution revenues are not decoupled for the distribution of electricity by ACE, and thus are
subject to variability due to changes in customer consumption. Therefore, changes in customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy savings programs or other reasons) from period to period have a direct impact on reported
distribution revenue for customers in ACE s service territory.    Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the
demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a  20-year  period in ACE s service territory. The
changes in heating and cooling degree days in ACE s service territory for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 compared to same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:

   Volume.  The decrease in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to
delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily reflects lower average customer usage, partially offset by the impact of moderate economic and customer
growth. The increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily reflects the
impact of moderate economic and customer growth.     Pricing Distribution Revenues.  The increase in electric operating revenues net of
purchased power expense as a result of pricing for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to customers that became effective in August
2016. The increase in distribution revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to customers that became effective September
2014. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     Regulatory
Required Programs.  This represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost

information on included programs.     Transmission Revenues.  Under a FERC approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based
upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing determinants. Transmission revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to higher rates effective
June 1, 2016 and June 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses. Transmission revenue remained constant for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to higher
rates effective June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2014 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses, offset by the establishment of a reserve related to the FERC ROE challenges in 2015.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources    
 Exelon activity presented below includes the activity of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE, from the PHI Merger effective date of March 24, 2016 through
December 31, 2016. Exelon prior year activity is unadjusted for the effects of the PHI Merger. Due to the application of push-down accounting to the PHI entity, PHI s activity is presented in two separate reporting periods, the legacy PHI
activity through March 23, 2016 (Predecessor), and PHI activity for the remainder of the period after the PHI merger date (Successor). For each of Pepco, DPL and ACE the activity presented below include its activity for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Exelon s and Generation s activity presented below includes the activity of CENG, from the integration date effective April 1, 2014. All results included throughout the liquidity and capital
resources section are presented on a GAAP basis.    The Registrants  operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally
generated cash flows from operations as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. Each Registrant s
access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the
Registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, the Registrants have access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $9 billion. In addition, Generation has $500 million in
bilateral facilities with banks which have various expirations between January 2017 and January 2019. The Registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue
letters of credit. See the  Credit Matters  section below for further discussion. The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.  
 The Registrants primarily use their capital resources, including cash, to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt,
pay dividends, fund pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. The Registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on
investment. Additionally, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time. See
Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Registrants  debt and credit agreements.  
  NRC Minimum Funding Requirements     NRC regulations require
that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts to decommission the facility. These NRC minimum funding levels are based upon the assumption
that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit. If a unit fails the NRC minimum funding test, then the plant s owners or parent companies would be required to take steps, such as
providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or  
      176  

Table of Contents  

making additional cash contributions to the NDT fund to ensure sufficient funds are available. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations to the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the NRC minimum funding requirements.    If a nuclear plant were to early retire there is a risk that it will
no longer meet the NRC minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the NDT fund investments could appreciate in value. A shortfall could require Exelon to post
parental guarantees for Generation s share of the obligations. However, the amount of any required guarantees will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach adopted at each site, the associated level of costs, and the decommissioning
trust fund investment performance going forward. Within two years after shutting down a plant, Generation must submit a post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR) to the NRC that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site.
When Generation files its biennial decommissioning funding status report with the NRC on March 31, 2017, as compared to previous estimates prior to the reversal of the early retirement decision, it is currently estimated that given the later
commencement of decommissioning activities and a longer time period over which the NDT fund investments can appreciate in value, Quad Cities will meet the NRC minimum funding requirements. It is currently estimated that Clinton will fall below the
NRC minimum funding requirements by only a small amount. As of December 31, 2016, TMI passes the NRC minimum funding test based on its current license life. However, in the event of an early retirement of TMI, the most costly estimates could
require parental guarantees of up to $60 million.    Upon issuance of any required financial guarantees, each site would be able to utilize the
respective NDT funds for radiological decommissioning costs, which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning costs. However, the NRC must approve an additional exemption in order for the plant s owner(s) to utilize the NDT
fund to pay for  non-radiological  decommissioning costs (i.e. spent fuel management and site restoration costs). If a unit does not receive this exemption, the costs would be borne by the owner(s). While the
ultimate amounts may vary greatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenarios and/or reimbursement of certain costs under the United States Department of Energy reimbursement agreements or future litigation, across the three
alternative decommissioning approaches available, if an early retirement decision is made and TMI were to fail the exemption test, Generation could incur spent fuel management and site restoration costs over the next ten years of up to
$145 million, net of taxes.     Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
   General      Generation s cash flows
from operating activities primarily result from the sale of electric energy and energy-related products and services to customers. Generation s future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices
of energy and its ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs as well as to obtain collections from customers.    The Utility
Registrants  cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of PECO, BGE, and DPL, gas distribution services. The Utility Registrants  distribution services are
provided to an established and diverse base of retail customers. The Utility Registrants  future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their
rates or operations, competitive suppliers, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions.    See Notes 3 Regulatory Matters and
24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation.

Table of Contents  

  The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting Exelon s cash flows from
operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:      

(a) 
 Represents depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion, net fair value changes related to derivatives, deferred income taxes, provision for uncollectible accounts, pension and
 non-pension  postretirement benefit expense, equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates and investments, decommissioning-related items, stock compensation expense, impairment of long-lived
assets, and other  non-cash  charges. See Note 25 Supplemental Financial Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on
 non-cash  operating activity.    

(b) 
 Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities exclude the changes in commercial paper, income taxes and the current portion of long-term debt.    

(c) 
 On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, beginning on April 1, 2014, CENG s revenues net of purchased power and fuel expenses are included on a
fully consolidated basis.        Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits    
 Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under
ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and  at-risk  status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. On
July 6, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the Twenty-first Century Act, which contains a pension funding provision that results in lower pension contributions in the near term while increasing the premiums
pension plans pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. On August 8, 2014, this funding relief was extended for five years. On November 2, 2015 the funding relief was extended for an additional three years and premiums pension plans
pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation were further increased. The estimated impacts of the law are reflected in the projected pension contributions below.  
 Exelon expects to make qualified pension plan contributions of $310 million to its qualified pension plans in 2017, of which Generation, ComEd,
PECO, BGE and Pepco expect to contribute $127 million, $33 million, $23 million, $38 million and $60 million, respectively. Exelon s and Generation s expected qualified pension plan contributions above include
$21 million related to the legacy CENG plans that will be funded by CENG as provided in an Employee Matters Agreement (EMA) between Exelon and CENG. Exelon s  non-qualified  pension plans are not
funded. Exelon expects to make  non-qualified  pension plan benefit payments of $23 million in 2017, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE and Pepco will make payments of $6 million, $1 million,
$1 million, $2 million and $1 million, respectively. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Registrants  2016 and 2015 pension contributions.  
      178  

Table of Contents  

  To the extent interest rates decline significantly or the pension plans do not earn the expected asset
return rates, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase. Additionally, expected contributions could change if Exelon changes its pension or OPEB funding strategy.  
 Unlike qualified pension plans, other postretirement benefit plans are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements and certain plans are
not funded. OPEB funding generally follows accounting cost; however, Exelon s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its funded other postretirement benefit plans, including
liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulator expectations and best assure continued recovery). Exelon expects to make other postretirement benefit plan contributions,
including benefit payments related to unfunded plans, of approximately $44 million in 2017, of which Generation, ComEd, BGE and Pepco expect to contribute $12 million, $2 million, $16 million and $10 million, respectively.
See Note 17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Registrants  2016 and 2015 other postretirement benefit contributions.  
 See the  Contractual Obligations  section for management s estimated future pension and other postretirement benefits contributions.  
   Tax Matters      The Registrants 
future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by the following tax matters:      

In order to appeal the Tax Court s like-kind exchange decision, Exelon is required to pay the tax, penalty and interest at the time Exelon files its appeal (expected in the second quarter of 2017). While the final
calculation of tax, penalty and interest has not yet been finalized by the IRS, Exelon estimates that a payment of approximately $1.4 billion related to the like-kind exchange will be due, including $300 million from ComEd, in the second
quarter of 2017. While Exelon will receive a tax benefit of approximately $400 million associated with the deduction for the interest, Exelon currently expects to have a net operating loss carryforward and thus does not expect to realize the
cash benefit until 2018. Exelon s total estimated cash outflow for the like-kind exchange is $1.0 billion, of which approximately $300 million would be attributable to ComEd after giving consideration to Exelon s agreement to
hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impacts of the  after-tax  interest and penalty amounts on ComEd s equity. ComEd will fund the $300 million with a combination of debt and equity in a manner to
maintain its current capital structure. Upon a final appellate decision, which could take up to several years, Exelon expects to receive $80 million related to final interest computations.    
 Of the above amounts payable, Exelon deposited with the IRS approximately $1.25 billion in October of 2016. The remaining amount will be paid in the
second quarter of 2017 at the time Exelon files its appeal of the Tax Court decision. Exelon funded the $1.25 billion deposit with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. The deposit is reflected as a current asset and the
related liabilities for the tax, penalty, and interest are included on Exelon s balance sheet as current obligations.      

In April of 2016, Exelon received tax refunds of approximately $460 million related to IRS positions settled in prior tax years. Of this amount, approximately $195 million of the refund is attributable to
Generation and the remaining $265 million is attributable to ComEd.        

State and local governments continue to face increasing financial challenges, which may increase the risk of additional income tax levies, property taxes and other taxes or the imposition, extension or permanence of
temporary tax levies.

  Cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 by Registrant
were as follows:      

(a) 
 On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, beginning on April 1, 2014, CENG s revenues net of purchased power and fuel expenses are included on a
fully consolidated basis.      Changes in Registrants  cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each
Registrant s respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below. In addition, significant operating cash flow impacts for the Registrants for 2016, 2015 and
2014 were as follows:      Generation        

Depending upon whether Generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may be required to be posted with or collected from its counterparties. In addition, the collateral posting and
collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on an exchange or in the OTC markets. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, Generation had net collections/(payments) of counterparty cash collateral of $923 million, $407 million and
$(1,748) million, respectively, primarily due to market conditions that resulted in changes to Generation s net mark-to-market position, as well as Exelon s decision to post more cash collateral in 2014 compared to using letters of credit
in 2015 to support the PHI merger financing.        

During 2016, 2015 and 2014, Generation had net (payments)/collections of approximately $(66) million, $58 million, and $38 million, respectively, related to purchases and sales of options. The level of option activity
in a given year may vary due to several factors, including changes in market conditions as well as changes in hedging strategy.    
   ComEd        

During 2016 and 2015, ComEd received a return of approximately $7 million of cash collateral from PJM and posted $31 million of cash collateral to PJM, respectively. During 2014, ComEd posted no cash collateral to PJM.
During 2016, ComEd s collateral posted with PJM has decreased due to lower PJM billings. During 2015 ComEd s collateral posted with PJM has increased primarily due to higher RPM credit requirements and higher PJM billings resulting from
increased load being served by ComEd as a result of City of Chicago customers switching back to ComEd.      For further discussion
regarding changes in  non-cash  operating activities, please refer to Note 25 Supplemental Financial Information of the Combined Notes to the Financial Statements.

   Exelon        

During 2016, Exelon had expenditures of $6.6 billion, $235 million and $58 million relating to the acquisitions of PHI, ConEdison Solutions and the pending acquisition of the FitzPatrick facility,
respectively.        

During 2014, Exelon had proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of certain long lived assets in order to finance a portion of the merger with PHI.    
   Generation

During 2014, Generation had proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of certain long lived assets in order to finance a portion of the merger with PHI.    
   Capital Expenditure Spending    
  Generation     Generation has entered into
several agreements to acquire equity interests in privately held development stage entities which develop energy-related technology. The agreements contain a series of scheduled investment commitments, including
 in-kind  services contributions. There are approximately $39 million of anticipated expenditures remaining through 2018 to fund anticipated planned capital and operating needs of the associated companies.
See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of Generation s equity interests.

  Capital expenditures by Registrant for the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 and projected
amounts for 2017 are as follows:      

(a) 
 Total projected capital expenditures do not include adjustments for  non-cash  activity.    

(b) 
 On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, beginning on April 1, 2014, CENG s revenues net of purchased power and fuel expenses are included on a
fully consolidated basis.    

(c) 
 The capital expenditures and 2017 projections include $281 million of expected incremental spending pursuant to EIMA, ComEd has committed to invest approximately $2.6 billion over a ten year period to
modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart grid technology.    

(d) 
 Includes corporate operations, BSC, and PHISCO rounded to the nearest $25 million.    

(e) 
 Includes PHISCO rounded to the nearest $25 million.      Projected capital expenditures and other
investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.      Generation    
 Approximately 35% and 23% of the projected 2017 capital expenditures at Generation are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel and the construction of new
natural gas plants, respectively, with the remaining amounts reflecting investment in renewable energy and additions and upgrades to existing facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages). Generation
anticipates that they will fund capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings.      ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE
     Approximately 89% of the projected 2017 capital expenditures at ComEd and 100% of the projected 2017 capital expenditures at PECO, BGE,
Pepco, DPL, and ACE are for continuing projects to maintain and improve operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems such as ComEd s reliability related investments required under
EIMA, and the Utility Registrants  construction commitments under PJM s RTEP. In addition to the capital expenditure for continuing projects, ComEd s total expenditures include smart grid/smart meter technology required under EIMA.
   The Utility Registrants as transmission owners are subject to NERC compliance requirements. NERC provides guidance to transmission owners regarding
assessments of transmission lines. The results of these assessments could require the Utility Registrants to incur incremental capital or operating and maintenance expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet NERC standards. In
 
      182  

Table of Contents  

2010, NERC provided guidance to transmission owners that recommended the Utility Registrants perform assessments of their transmission lines. ComEd, PECO and BGE submitted their final  bi-annual  reports to NERC in January 2014. ComEd, PECO and BGE will be incurring incremental capital expenditures associated with this guidance following the completion of the assessments. Specific projects and
expenditures are identified as the assessments are completed. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s forecasted 2017 capital expenditures above reflect capital spending for remediation to be completed through 2018. Pepco, DPL and ACE have
substantially completed their assessments and thus do not expect significant capital expenditures related to this guidance in 2017.    The Utility
Registrants anticipate that they will fund their capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings and additional capital contributions from parent, including ComEd s capital expenditures associated with EIMA
as further discussed in Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     Cash Flows from Financing

   Credit Matters   
   Market Conditions      The Registrants fund
liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. The
credit facilities include $9.5 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $7.9 billion was available as of December 31, 2016, and of which no financial institution has more than 7% of the aggregate commitments for Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE. The Registrants had access to the commercial paper market during 2016 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. The Registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity
position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels and the impacts of
hypothetical credit downgrades. The Registrants have continued to closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default
swap levels, capital raising and merger activity. See PART I. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for further information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.  
 The Registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. If
Generation lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2016, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of $1.9 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives,
 non-derivatives,  normal purchase normal sales contracts and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements, which is well within its current
available credit facility capacities of $4.2 billion.    The following table presents the incremental collateral that each Utility Registrant
would have been required to provide in the event each utility registrant lost its investment grade credit rating at December 31, 2016 and available credit facility capacity prior to any incremental collateral at December 31, 2016:  

(a) 
 Represents incremental collateral related to natural gas procurement contracts.        Exelon Credit
Facilities      Exelon, ComEd and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Generation
and PECO meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the intercompany money pool. PHI meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term
notes and the Exelon intercompany money pool. Pepco, DPL and ACE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and short-term notes. The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for
general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.    See Note 14 Debt and
Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Registrants  credit facilities and short term borrowing activity.

    Other Credit Matters    
  Capital Structure . At December 31, 2016, the capital structures of the Registrants consisted of the following:  

(a) 
 Includes approximately $641 million, $205 million, $184 million and $252 million owed to unconsolidated affiliates of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE respectively. These special purpose entities were
created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of ComEd, PECO and BGE. See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the authoritative guidance for VIEs.        Security Ratings    
 The Registrants  access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may
depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.    The Registrants  borrowings are not subject to default
or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading of a Registrant s securities could increase fees and interest charges under that Registrant s credit agreements.  
 As part of the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Registrants and
their counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law, if the Registrants are downgraded by a credit rating agency, it is
possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include the posting of collateral. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of
the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on collateral provisions.

Table of Contents  

    Intercompany Money Pool    
 To provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external
financing, both Exelon and PHI operate an intercompany money pool. Maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participant and the net contribution or borrowing as of December 31, 2016, are presented in the following
tables:      

(a) 
 As a result of the merger, PHI Corporate and PCI began to participate in the Exelon Intercompany Money Pool effective March 24, 2016.    
   
     Investments in Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds.   Exelon, Generation and CENG maintain trust funds, as
required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning nuclear plants. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to offset inflationary increases in decommissioning costs.
Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocations in accordance with Generation s NDT fund investment policy. Generation s and CENG s investment policies establish
limits on the concentration of holdings in any one company and also in any one industry. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the trust
funds, the NRC s minimum funding requirements and related liquidity ramifications.      Shelf Registration Statements.   Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco and DPL have a currently effective combined shelf registration statement unlimited in amount, filed with the SEC, that will expire in August 2019. The ability of each Registrant to sell securities off the shelf
registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the Registrant,
its securities ratings and market conditions.  
      197  

Table of Contents  

    Regulatory Authorizations.   Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE are required to
obtain short-term and long-term financing authority from Federal and State Commissions as follows:      

(a) 
 Generation currently has blanket financing authority it received from FERC in connection with its market-based rate authority.    

(c) 
 In December 2016, BGE filed an application for $1 billion of long term financing authority with the MDPSC.    
 Exelon s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the receipt of dividends paid by its operating subsidiaries. The payments of
dividends to Exelon by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings. The Federal Power Act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility
 to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  In addition, under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock, unless, among other things,
its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless ComEd has specific authorization from the ICC. BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions
established by the MDPSC. First, BGE was prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity
ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must
notify the MDPSC that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid. There are no other limitations on BGE paying common stock dividends unless BGE elects to defer interest payments on the
6.20% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid. Pepco, DPL and ACE are subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in NJ, DE, MD and the DC. Pepco, DPL and ACE
are prohibited from paying a dividend on their common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, Pepco s, DPL s or ACE s equity ratio would be below 48% as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the
Commissions and the Board or (b) Pepco s, DPL s or ACE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. At December 31, 2016, Exelon had retained earnings of
$12,030 million, including Generation s undistributed earnings of $2,275 million, ComEd s retained earnings of $987 million consisting of retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $2,626 million partially
offset by $1,639 million of unappropriated retained deficit, PECO s retained earnings of $941 million and BGE s retained earnings $1,427 million. At December 31, 2016, Pepco had retained earnings of $991 million,
DPL had retained earnings of $562 million and ACE had retained earnings of $122 million. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding

ITEM 7A.  
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Registrants are exposed to market
risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates and equity prices. Exelon s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit
approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief executive officer and includes the chief risk officer, chief strategy officer, chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief
financial officer and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of the risk management activities.  
  Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants)     Commodity price risk
is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the amount of energy Exelon
generates differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon has price risk from commodity price movements. Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity, fossil fuel and other
commodities.        Generation    
   Normal Operations and Hedging Activities.   Electricity available from Generation s owned or contracted generation supply in excess
of Generation s obligations to customers, including portions of the Utility Registrants  retail load, is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, Generation enters into  non-derivative  contracts as well as derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps, and options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. Generation believes these instruments represent
economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its economic hedges will occur during 2017 through 2019.  
 In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation s owned and
contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Exelon s hedging program involves the hedging of commodity risk for Exelon s expected generation, typically on a ratable basis over a three-year period. As of
December 31, 2016, the proportion of expected generation hedged is  91%-94%,   56%-59%  and  28%-31%  for 2017, 2018 and 2019,
respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents  

      205  

Table of Contents  

our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generating facilities based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are
calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain  non-derivative  contracts including
Generation s sales to the Utility Registrants to serve their retail load.    A portion of Generation s hedging strategy may be accomplished
with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. Market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure
for Generation s entire  non-proprietary  trading portfolio associated with a $5 reduction in the annual average
  around-the-clock   energy price based on December 31, 2016 market conditions and hedged position would be decreases in  pre-tax 
net income of approximately $65 million, $410 million and $685 million, respectively, for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Power price sensitivities are derived by adjusting power price assumptions while keeping all other price inputs constant.
Generation expects to actively manage its portfolio to mitigate market price risk exposure for its unhedged position. Actual results could differ depending on the specific timing of, and markets affected by, price changes, as well as future changes
in Generation s portfolio.      Proprietary Trading Activities.   Generation also enters into certain energy-related derivatives
for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those entered into with the intent of hedging or managing risk. Proprietary
trading activities are subject to limits established by Exelon s RMC. The proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including volume, stop loss and   Value-at-Risk   (VaR) limits to manage exposure to market risk. Additionally, the Exelon risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of the
proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities, which included physical volumes of 6,179 GWh, 7,310 GWh, and 10,571 GWh for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively, are a complement to Generation s
energy marketing portfolio, but represent a small portion of Generation s overall revenue from energy marketing activities. Proprietary trading portfolio activity for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulted in  pre-tax  gains of $15 million due to net   mark-to-market   gains of $1 million and realized gains of $14 million. Generation
uses a 95% confidence interval, assuming standard normal distribution, one day holding period, and  one-tailed  statistical measure in calculating its VaR. The daily VaR on proprietary trading activity averaged
$0.2 million of exposure during the year. Generation has not segregated proprietary trading activity within the following discussion because of the relative size of the proprietary trading portfolio in comparison to Generation s total
Revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $8,921 million.      Fuel
Procurement  . Generation procures natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted
conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability
restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential  non-performance  of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or
service at the contracted prices. Approximately 39% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements from 2017 through 2021 are supplied by three producers. In the event of  non-performance  by these or
other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements.
 Non-performance  by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial positions.

      ComEd    
 ComEd entered into  20-year  contracts for renewable energy and RECs beginning in June 2012. ComEd is permitted to
recover its renewable energy and REC costs from retail customers with no  mark-up.  The annual commitments represent the maximum settlements with suppliers for renewable energy and RECs under the existing
contract terms. Pursuant to the ICC s Order on December 19, 2012, ComEd s commitments under the existing long-term contracts were reduced for the June 2013 through May 2014 procurement period. In addition, the ICC s
December 18, 2013 Order approved the reduction of ComEd s commitments under those contracts for the June 2014 through May 2015 procurement period, and the amount of the reduction was approved by the ICC in March 2014. See Note
3 Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding energy procurement and derivatives. ComEd does not enter into derivatives for
speculative or proprietary trading purposes.        PECO    
 PECO has contracts to procure electric supply that were executed through the competitive procurement process outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Programs,
which are further discussed in Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. PECO has certain full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives and qualify for the normal purchases and normal
sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Under the DSP Programs, PECO is permitted to recover its electric supply procurement costs from retail
customers with no  mark-up.     PECO has also entered into derivative natural gas contracts, which either
qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception or have no   mark-to-market   balances because the derivatives are index priced, to hedge its long-term price
risk in the natural gas market. PECO s hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on its financial position or results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.  
 PECO does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note
13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        BGE
     BGE procures electric supply for default service customers through full requirements contracts pursuant to BGE s MDPSC-approved SOS
program. BGE s full requirements contracts that are considered derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance, and as a result, are accounted for on an accrual basis
of accounting. Under the SOS program, BGE is permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers, plus an administrative fee which includes a shareholder return component and an incremental cost component. However, through
December 2016, BGE provides all residential electric customers a credit for the residential shareholder return component of the administrative charge.  
 BGE has also entered into natural gas contracts, which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception, to hedge its price risk in the
natural gas market. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on BGE s financial position. However, under BGE s market-based rates incentive mechanism, BGE s actual cost of gas is compared to a market index
(a measure of the market price of gas in a given period). The difference between BGE s actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers.  
 BGE does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note
13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

      Pepco    
 Pepco has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and DCPSC. The SOS
rates charged recover Pepco s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee. The administrative fee includes an incremental cost component and a shareholder return component for residential and commercial rate classes.
Pepco s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. Pepco locks in fixed prices for all of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of Pepco s full requirements contracts, which are considered
derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other Pepco full requirements contracts are not derivatives.  
 Pepco does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note

     DPL has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and the
DPSC. The SOS rates charged recover DPL s wholesale power supply costs. In Delaware, DPL is also entitled to recover a Reasonable Allowance for Retail Margin (RARM). The RARM includes a fixed annual margin of approximately $2.75 million,
plus an incremental cost component and a cash working capital allowance. In Maryland, DPL charges an administrative fee intended to allow it to recover its administrative costs. DPL locks in fixed prices for all of its SOS requirements through full
requirements contracts. DPL s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. Certain of DPL s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative
authoritative guidance. Other DPL full requirements contracts are not derivatives.    DPL provides natural gas to its customers under a GCR mechanism
approved by the DPSC. The demand portion of the GCR is based upon DPL s firm transportation and storage contracts. DPL has firm deliverability of swing and seasonal storage; a liquefied natural gas facility and firm transportation capacity to
meet customer demand and provide a reserve margin. The commodity portion of the GCR includes a commission approved hedging program which is intended to reduce gas commodity price volatility while limiting the firm natural gas customers 
exposure to adverse changes in the market price of natural gas.    DPL does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading
purposes. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding energy procurement and derivatives.  
     ACE      ACE

    ComEd    
 Credit risk for ComEd is governed by credit and collection policies, which are aligned with state regulatory requirements. ComEd is currently obligated
to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territory. ComEd records a provision for uncollectible accounts, based upon historical experience, to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note
1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. ComEd will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the
provision for uncollectible accounts. The Illinois Public Utilities Act prohibits utilities, including ComEd, from terminating electric service to a residential electric space heat customer due to nonpayment between December 1 of any year
through March 31 of the following year. ComEd s ability to disconnect non space-heating residential customers is also impacted by certain weather restrictions, at any time of year, under the Illinois Public Utilities Act. ComEd will
monitor the impact of its disconnection practices and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. ComEd did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2016. See Note
3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding ComEd s recently approved tariffs to adjust rates annually through a rider mechanism to reflect increases or decreases in
annual uncollectible accounts expense.    ComEd s power procurement contracts provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The
credit position is based on forward market prices compared to the benchmark prices. The benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the contract term and are set at the point of supplier bid submittals. If the forward market
price of energy exceeds the benchmark price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion after adjusting for any unpaid deliveries and unsecured credit allowed under the contract. The unsecured credit used by the
suppliers represents ComEd s net credit exposure. ComEd s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd s credit exposure to energy
suppliers was approximately $1 million.      PECO    
 Credit risk for PECO is managed by credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. PECO is currently obligated
to provide service to all retail electric customers within its franchised territory. PECO records a provision for uncollectible accounts to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note 1 Significant Accounting
Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. In accordance with PAPUC regulations, after November 30 and before April 1, an electric distribution utility or
natural gas distribution utility shall not terminate service to customers with household incomes at or below 250% of the Federal poverty level. PECO s provision for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in prices as
well as changes in PAPUC regulations. PECO did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2016.  
 PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its DSP Program contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance
requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the
supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the
forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. As of December 31, 2016, PECO had no net
credit exposure with suppliers.  
      213  

Table of Contents  

  PECO does not obtain cash collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and asset management
agreements. As of December 31, 2016, PECO s credit exposure under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements with investment grade suppliers was immaterial.  
   BGE      Credit risk for BGE is managed by
credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. BGE is currently obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territory. BGE records a provision for uncollectible accounts to
provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. BGE will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for uncollectible accounts policy. MDPSC regulations prohibit BGE from terminating service to residential customers due to nonpayment from November 1 through March 31 if the forecasted
temperature is 32 degrees or below for the subsequent 72 hour period. BGE is also prohibited by the Public Utilities Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland and MDPSC regulations from terminating service to residential customers due to
nonpayment if the forecasted temperature is 95 degrees or above for the subsequent 72 hour period. BGE did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2016.  
 BGE s full requirement wholesale electric power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a
supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier, or its guarantor, to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest
credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth, subject to an unsecured credit cap. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a
transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is
greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents BGE s net credit exposure. The seller s credit exposure is calculated each business day. As of December 31, 2016, BGE had
no net credit exposure with suppliers.    BGE s regulated gas business is exposed to market-price risk. This market-price risk is mitigated by
BGE s recovery of its costs to procure natural gas through a gas cost adjustment clause approved by the MDPSC. BGE does make  off-system  sales after BGE has satisfied its customers  demands, which are
not covered by the gas cost adjustment clause. At December 31, 2016, BGE had credit exposure of $8 million related to  off-system  sales which is mitigated by parental guarantees, letters of credit, or
right to offset clauses within other contracts with those third-party suppliers.      Pepco    
 Credit risk for Pepco is managed by credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. Pepco is currently obligated
to provide service to all retail electric customers within its franchised territory. Pepco records a provision for uncollectible accounts to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note 1 Significant Accounting
Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. In accordance with MDPSC and DCPSC regulations, applicable weather regulatory provisions are in effect January through December,
the utility will not terminate service to any residential customer when weather conditions prohibit termination. Additional MDPSC cold weather requirements are in effect after November 1 and before April 1. Pepco s provision for
uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in prices as well as changes in MDPSC and DCPSC regulations. Pepco did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2016.  
      214  

Table of Contents  

  Pepco s full requirement wholesale electric power agreements in Maryland and the District of Columbia,
that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of
unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth, subject to an unsecured cap. The credit position is based on the initial market price,
which is the forward price of energy on the day. A similar agreement in the District of Columbia requires a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a specified amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the total purchase amount. As of
December 31, 2016, Pepco had no net credit exposure with suppliers.      DPL    
 Credit risk for DPL is managed by credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. DPL is currently obligated to
provide service to all retail electric customers within its franchised territory. DPL records a provision for uncollectible accounts to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note 1 Significant Accounting
Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. In accordance with DPSC and MDPSC regulations, applicable weather regulatory provisions are in effect January through December,
the utility will not terminate service to any residential customer when weather conditions prohibit termination. Additional cold weather regulatory requirements are in effect after November 1 and before April 1. DPL s provision for
uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in prices as well as changes in DPSC and MDPSC regulations. DPL did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2016.  
 DPL s full requirement wholesale electric power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a
supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the
major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day. As of December 31, 2016, DPL had no net credit exposure with
suppliers.    DPL conducts margining under it natural gas supply contracts. As of December 31, 2016, DPL s credit exposure under its
natural gas supply and asset management agreements was immaterial.      ACE    
 Credit risk for ACE is managed by credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. ACE is currently obligated to
provide service to all retail electric customers within its franchised territory. ACE records a provision for uncollectible accounts to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note 1 Significant Accounting
Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. In accordance with NJBPU regulations, applicable weather regulatory provisions are in effect January through December, the
utility will not terminate service to any residential customer when weather conditions prohibit termination. Additional cold weather regulatory requirements are in effect after November 15 and through March 15. ACE s provision for
uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in prices as well as changes in NJBPU regulations. ACE did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2016.  
 ACE s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s
creditworthiness requirements, require a supplier to partially meet its credit requirements with an independent credit requirement in an amount equal to $2.4 million per  
      215

tranche and allow a supplier to meet its additional credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest
credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day. As of December 31, 2016, ACE had no net
credit exposure with suppliers.      Collateral (All Registrants)    
   Generation      As part of the normal
course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or financial contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, natural gas and other commodities. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit Generation and
its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if Generation is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such
downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on Generation s net position
with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly  agreed-to  provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a
function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, Generation believes an amount of several months of future payments (i.e. capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best
estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding collateral
requirements.    Generation transacts output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the
ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial
position. As market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels, Generation is required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with
Generation. In order to post collateral, Generation depends on access to bank credit facilities, which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See ITEM 7. Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Matters Exelon
Credit Facilities for additional information.    As of December 31, 2016, Generation had cash collateral of $347 million posted and cash
collateral held of $24 million for external counterparties with derivative positions, of which $329 million and $2 million in net cash collateral deposits were offset against energy derivative and interest rate and foreign exchange
derivative related to underlying energy contracts, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, $8 million of cash collateral held was not offset against net derivative positions because it was not associated with energy-related derivatives or
as of the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. As of December 31, 2015, Generation had cash collateral posted of $1,267 million and cash collateral held of $21 million for external counterparties with derivative
positions, of which $1,234 million and $9 million in net cash collateral deposits were offset against energy derivatives and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives related to underlying energy contracts, respectively. As of
December 31, 2015, $3 million of cash collateral posted was not offset against net derivative positions because it was not associated with energy-related derivatives or as the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. See Note
24 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.

    ComEd    
 As of December 31, 2016, ComEd held $3 million in collateral from suppliers in association with standard block energy procurement contracts and
held approximately $19 million in the form of cash and letters of credit for renewable energy contracts. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.      PECO    
 As of December 31, 2016, PECO was not required to post collateral under its energy and natural gas procurement contracts. See Note
13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.      BGE
     BGE is not required to post collateral under its electric supply contracts. As of December 31, 2016, BGE was not required to post
collateral under its natural gas procurement contracts, nor was it holding collateral under its electric supply contracts, but was holding $1 million in collateral under its natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 13 Derivative
Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.      Pepco    
 Pepco is not required to post collateral under its energy procurement contracts. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.      DPL    
 DPL is not required to post collateral under its energy procurement contracts. As of December 31, 2016, DPL was not required to post collateral
under its natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
   ACE      ACE is not required to post
collateral under its energy procurement contracts. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
   RTOs and ISOs (All Registrants)      Generation, ComEd,
PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE participate in all, or some, of the established, real-time energy markets that are administered by PJM,  ISO-NE,   ISO-NY,  CAISO, MISO, SPP,
AESO, OIESO and ERCOT. In these areas, power is traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers and on the spot markets that are operated by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no spot market, electricity is
purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For sales into the spot markets administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit
policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants.  Non-performance 
or  non-payment  by a major counterparty could result in a material adverse impact on the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows and financial positions.  
      217  

Table of Contents  

    Exchange Traded Transactions (Exelon, Generation, PHI and DPL)    
 Generation enters into commodity transactions on NYMEX, ICE and the Nodal exchange. DPL enters into commodity transactions on ICE. The NYMEX, ICE and
Nodal exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange are
significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk.     Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (All Registrants)   
 The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants may also utilize   fixed-to-floating   interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest rate exposure. In addition, the Registrants may
utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. These strategies are employed to manage interest rate risks. At December 31, 2016, Exelon had
$800 million of notional amounts of   fixed-to-floating   hedges outstanding and Exelon and Generation had $659 million of notional amounts of   floating-to-fixed   hedges outstanding. Assuming the fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges are 100% effective, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in the interest rates
associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and   fixed-to-floating   swaps would result in approximately a $7 million decrease in Exelon
Consolidated  pre-tax  income for the year ended December 31, 2016. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation
utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges.     Equity Price Risk (Exelon and Generation)   
 Exelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning Generation s nuclear plants. As of
December 31, 2016, Generation s decommissioning trust funds are reflected at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to
compensate Generation for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to
changes in interest rates. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with Generation s NDT fund investment policy. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest
rates and decrease in equity prices would result in a $535 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Generation   
  General     Generation s integrated business consists of the
generation, physical delivery and marketing of power across multiple geographical regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation, which sells electricity and natural gas to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation also sells
renewable energy and other energy-related products and services, and engages in natural gas and oil exploration and production activities. Generation has six reportable segments consisting of the  Mid-Atlantic, 
Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions. These segments are discussed in further detail in  ITEM 1. BUSINESS Exelon Generation Company, LLC  of this  Form 10-K.

of Operations Generation  in  EXELON CORPORATION Results of Operations  of this Form  10-K.   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources     Generation s business
is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. Generation s capital resources are primarily provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing, including the issuance
of long-term debt, commercial paper, participation in the intercompany money pool or capital contributions from Exelon. Generation s access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and general business
conditions, as well as that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to where Generation no longer has access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, Generation has access to credit facilities in the aggregate of
$5.8 billion that Generation currently utilizes to support its commercial paper program and to issue letters of credit.    See  EXELON
CORPORATION Liquidity and Capital Resources  and Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form  10-K  for further discussion.  
 Capital resources are used primarily to fund Generation s capital requirements, including construction, retirement of debt, the payment of
distributions to Exelon, contributions to Exelon s pension plans and investments in new and existing ventures. Future acquisitions could require external financing or borrowings or capital contributions from Exelon.

ITEM 8.  
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA        Management s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting     The management of Exelon Corporation (Exelon) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule  13a-15(f).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
 Exelon s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Exelon s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, Exelon s
management concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, Exelon s internal control over financial reporting was effective.    We excluded
ConEdison Solutions from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination on September 1, 2016. The total assets and total operating
revenues related to ConEdison Solutions, a wholly-owned subsidiary, represent less than 1% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.  
 The effectiveness of Exelon s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.    February 13, 2017

 The management of Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule  13a-15(f).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.    Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.    Generation s management conducted
an assessment of the effectiveness of Generation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in  Internal Control Integrated Framework
(2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, Generation s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, Generation s internal control over financial
reporting was effective.    We excluded ConEdison Solutions from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016
because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination on September 1, 2016. The total assets and total operating revenues related to ConEdison Solutions, a wholly-owned subsidiary, represent less than 1% and 2%, respectively, of
the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.    The effectiveness of Generation s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of

  Index to Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   
 The notes to the consolidated financial statements that follow are a combined presentation. The following list indicates the registrants to which the
footnotes apply:     Applicable Notes       
      1. Significant Accounting Policies (All Registrants)   
  Description of Business (All Registrants)     Exelon is a utility
services holding company engaged through its principal subsidiaries in the energy generation and energy distribution and transmission businesses. Prior to March 23, 2016, Exelon s principal, wholly owned subsidiaries included Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE. On March 23, 2016, in conjunction with the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the PHI Merger Agreement), Purple Acquisition Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon, merged with and into PHI, with PHI
continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon. PHI is a utility services holding company engaged through its principal wholly owned subsidiaries, Pepco, DPL and ACE, in the energy distribution and transmission businesses.
Refer to Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for further information regarding the merger transaction.    The energy generation
business includes:      

Generation : Generation, physical delivery and marketing of power across multiple geographical regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation. Generation also sells renewable energy and other
energy-related products and services. Generation has six reportable segments consisting of the  Mid-Atlantic,  Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions.    
 The energy delivery businesses include:

regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of natural gas distribution services in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       

Pepco : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission services in the District of Columbia and major portions of Prince George s County and
Montgomery County in Maryland.        

DPL : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission services in portions of Maryland and Delaware, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of
natural gas and the provision of natural gas distribution services in northern Delaware.        

ACE : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission services in southern New Jersey.    
  Basis of Presentation (All Registrants)     This is a combined
annual report of all registrants. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to the registrants as indicated above in the Index to Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and parenthetically next to each corresponding
disclosure. When appropriate, the registrants are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures.    Each of the Registrant s
Consolidated Financial Statements includes the accounts of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All Equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates have been presented below Income taxes in the
Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income starting in the first quarter of 2015.    Pursuant to the acquisition
of PHI, Exelon s financial reporting reflects PHI s consolidated financial results subsequent to the March 23, 2016, acquisition date. Exelon has accounted for the merger transaction applying the acquisition method of accounting,
which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Exelon to be reported in Exelon s financial statements at fair value, with any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired reported as
goodwill. Exelon has pushed-down the application of the acquisition method of accounting to the consolidated financial statements of PHI such that the assets and liabilities of PHI are similarly recorded at their respective fair values, and
goodwill has been established as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of PHI for periods before and after the March 23, 2016, acquisition date reflect different bases of accounting, and the financial
positions and the results of operations of the predecessor and successor periods are not comparable. The acquisition method of accounting has not been pushed down to PHI s wholly-owned subsidiary utility registrants, Pepco, DPL and ACE.
   For financial statement purposes, beginning on March 24, 2016, disclosures that had solely related to PHI, Pepco, DPL or ACE activities now
also apply to Exelon, unless otherwise noted.    Through its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of
support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology and supply management services. The costs of BSC, including support services, are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries using a
cost-causative allocation method. Corporate governance-type costs that cannot be directly assigned are allocated based on a Modified Massachusetts Formula, which is a method that utilizes a combination of gross revenues, total assets and direct
labor costs for the allocation base. The results of Exelon s corporate operations are presented as  Other  within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed.

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  PHISCO, a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, provides a variety of support services at cost, including
legal, accounting, engineering, distribution and transmission planning, asset management, system operations, and power procurement, to PHI and its operating subsidiaries. These services are directly charged or allocated pursuant to service
agreements among PHI Service Company and the participating operating subsidiaries.    Exelon owns 100% of all of its significant consolidated
subsidiaries, including PHI, either directly or indirectly, except for ComEd, of which Exelon owns more than 99%. As of December 31, 2016, Exelon owned none of BGE s preferred securities, which BGE redeemed in 2016. Exelon has reflected
the third-party interests in ComEd, which totaled less than $1 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as equity, and BGE s preference stock as BGE preference stock not subject to mandatory redemption in its
consolidated financial statements. BGE is subject to some ring-fencing measures established by order of the MDPSC. As part of this arrangement, BGE common stock is held directly by RF Holdco LLC, which is an indirect subsidiary of
Exelon. GSS Holdings (BGE Utility), an unrelated party, holds a nominal  non-economic  interest in RF Holdco LLC with limited voting rights on specified matters. PHI is subject to some ring-fencing measures
established by orders of the DCPSC, DPSC, MDPSC and NJBPU, pursuant to which all of the membership interest in PHI is held directly by PH Holdco LLC, which is an indirect subsidiary of Exelon. GSS Holdings (PH Utility), Inc., an unrelated
party, holds a nominal non-economic interest in PH Holdco LLC with limited voting rights on specified matters. PHI owns 100% of its subsidiaries including Pepco, DPL and ACE.  
 Generation owns 100% of all of its significant consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for certain variable interest entities,
including CENG, of which Generation holds a 50.01% interest. The remaining interests are included in noncontrolling interests on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for further
discussion of Exelon s and Generation s consolidated VIEs.    The Registrants consolidate the accounts of entities in which a Registrant has
a controlling financial interest, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. A controlling financial interest is evidenced by either a voting interest greater than 50% in which the Registrant can exercise control over the operations and
policies of the investee, or the results of a model that identifies the Registrant or one of its subsidiaries as the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Where the Registrants do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity, proportionate
consolidation, equity method accounting or cost method accounting is applied. The Registrants apply proportionate consolidation when they have an undivided interest in an asset and are proportionately liable for their share of each liability
associated with the asset. The Registrants proportionately consolidate their undivided ownership interests in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities. Under proportionate consolidation, the Registrants separately record their
proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the undivided interest in the asset. The Registrants apply equity method accounting when they have significant influence over an investee through an ownership in common
stock, which generally approximates a 20% to 50% voting interest. The Registrants apply equity method accounting to certain investments and joint ventures, including certain financing trusts of ComEd, PECO and BGE. Under the equity method, the
Registrants report their interest in the entity as an investment and the Registrants  percentage share of the earnings from the entity as single line items in their financial statements. The Registrants use the cost method if they lack
significant influence, which generally results when they hold less than 20% of the common stock of an entity. Under the cost method, the Registrants report their investments at cost and recognize income only to the extent dividends or distributions
are received.

financial statements of each of the Registrants in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates
have been made include, but are not limited to, the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs and other AROs, pension and other postretirement benefits, the application of purchase accounting, inventory reserves, allowance for uncollectible
accounts, goodwill and asset impairments, derivative instruments, unamortized energy contracts, fixed asset depreciation, environmental costs and other loss contingencies, taxes and unbilled energy revenues. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.     Reclassifications (All Registrants)     Certain
prior year amounts in the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been reclassified between line items for comparative purposes. The
reclassifications did not affect any of the Registrants  net income, financial positions, or cash flows from operating activities.    Certain
prior year amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE have been reclassified to conform the presentation of these
amounts to the current period presentation in Exelon s financial statements. Most significantly for PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE, current regulatory assets and liabilities have been presented separately from the
 non-current  portions in each respective Consolidated Balance Sheet where recovery or refund is expected within the next 12 months. Additionally, for PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE, the removal cost within
Accumulated depreciation was reclassified to the Regulatory liability or Regulatory asset account to align with Exelon s presentation. The reclassifications were not considered errors in the prior financial statements.  
  Accounting for the Effects of Regulation (Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)   
 The Registrants apply the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires them to record in their consolidated
financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: 1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the
entities  cost of providing services or products; and (3) there is a reasonable expectation that rates are set at levels that will recover the entities  costs from customers. Exelon and the Utility Registrants account for their
regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, principally the ICC, the PAPUC, the MDPSC, the DCPSC, the DPSC and the NJBPU, under state public utility laws and the
FERC under various Federal laws. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized and the related expense or revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. Exelon
believes that it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. Exelon and the Utility Registrants continue to

evaluate their respective abilities to continue to apply the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, including consideration of current events in their respective
regulatory and political environments. If a separable portion of the Registrants  business was no longer able to meet the criteria discussed above, the affected entities would be required to eliminate from their consolidated financial
statements the effects of regulation for that portion, which could have a material impact on their results of operations and financial positions. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.  
 ACE has a recovery mechanism for purchased power costs associated with BGS. ACE records a deferred energy supply costs regulatory asset or regulatory
liability for under or over-recovered costs that are expected to be recovered from or refunded to ACE customers, respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, ACE changed its method of accounting for determining under or over-recovered costs in this
recovery mechanism to include unbilled revenues in the determination of under or over-recovered costs. ACE believes this change is preferable as it better reflects the economic impacts of   dollar-for-dollar   cost recovery mechanisms. ACE applied the change retrospectively. The impact of the change was a $12 million reduction to ACE s opening Retained earnings as of January 1, 2014
with a corresponding reduction to Regulatory assets. The impact of the change on Net income attributable to common shareholder was an increase of $2 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31,
2014, respectively.    The Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the
financial statements as a  non-recognized  subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.  
  Revenues (All Registrants)       Operating Revenues.  
Operating revenues are recorded as service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. At the end of each month, the Registrants accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered or services provided to customers. ComEd records its
best estimates of the distribution and transmission revenue impacts resulting from changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE record their
best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from changes in rates that they each believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 6 Accounts
Receivable for further information.      RTOs and ISOs.   In RTO and ISO markets that facilitate the dispatch of energy and energy-related
products, the Registrants generally report sales and purchases conducted on a net hourly basis in either revenues or purchased power on their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, the classification of which depends on the
net hourly activity. In addition, capacity revenue and expense classification is based on the net sale or purchase position of the Company in the different RTOs and ISOs.  
   Option Contracts, Swaps and Commodity Derivatives.   Certain option contracts and swap arrangements that meet the definition of derivative
instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense. The classification of revenue or expense is based on the intent of the transaction. For example, gas transactions may be used to hedge the
sale of power. This will result in the change in fair value recorded through revenue. To the

extent a Utility Registrant receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, it records the fair value of its energy swap contracts with unaffiliated
suppliers as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for further information.  
   Proprietary Trading Activities.   Exelon and Generation account for Generation s trading activities under the provisions of the
authoritative guidance for accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities, which require energy revenues and costs related to energy trading contracts to be presented on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Commodity derivatives used for trading purposes are accounted for using the   mark-to-market   method with unrealized gains and
losses recognized in operating revenues. Refer to Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for further information.     Income Taxes (All Registrants)   
 Deferred Federal and state income taxes are provided on all significant temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. Investment tax credits have been deferred on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in book income over the life of the related property. In accordance with applicable
authoritative guidance, the Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a  two-step  approach; a  more-likely-than-not 
recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not
 more-likely-than-not  that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a
tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Registrants recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense or Other income and deductions (interest income) and recognize penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in Other, net on their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.    In the first quarter of 2016, PHI,
Pepco, DPL and ACE changed their accounting for classification of interest on uncertain tax positions. PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE have reclassified interest on uncertain tax positions as Interest expense from Income tax expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. GAAP does not address the preferability of one acceptable method of accounting over the other for the classification of interest on uncertain tax positions. However, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE believe
this change is preferable for comparability of their financial statements with the financial statements of the other Registrants in the combined filing, for consistency with FERC classification and for a more appropriate representation of the
effective tax rate as they manage the settlement of uncertain tax positions and interest expense separately. PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE applied the change retrospectively. The reclassification in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 is $34 million and $4 million for PHI and Pepco, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2014 is $1 million for both Pepco and ACE. The impact on all other
PHI Registrants for years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 is less than $1 million.    Pursuant to the IRC and relevant
state taxing authorities, Exelon and its subsidiaries file consolidated or combined income tax returns for Federal and certain state jurisdictions where allowed or required. See Note 15 Income Taxes for further information.

   Taxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions (All Registrants)   
 The Registrants collect certain taxes from customers such as sales and gross receipts taxes, along with other taxes, surcharges and fees that are levied
by state or local governments on the sale or distribution of gas and electricity. Some of these taxes are imposed on the customer, but paid by the Registrants, while others are imposed on the Registrants. Where these taxes are imposed on the
customer, such as sales taxes, they are reported on a net basis with no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. However, where these taxes are imposed on the Registrants, such as gross receipts taxes or other
surcharges or fees, they are reported on a gross basis. Accordingly, revenues are recognized for the taxes collected from customers along with an offsetting expense. See Note 25 Supplemental Financial Information for Generation s,
ComEd s, PECO s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s utility taxes that are presented on a gross basis.     Cash and Cash Equivalents (All
Registrants)     The Registrants consider investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
  Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants)   
 Restricted cash and cash equivalents represent funds that are restricted to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of December 31, 2016 and
2015, Exelon Corporate s restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented restricted funds for payment of medical, dental, vision and long-term disability benefits. Generation s restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily
included cash at various project-specific  non-recourse  financing structures for debt service and financing of operations of the underlying entities, see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional
information on Generation s project- specific financing structures. ComEd s restricted cash primarily represented cash collateral held from suppliers associated with ComEd s energy and REC procurement contracts. PECO s restricted
cash primarily represented funds from the sales of assets that were subject to PECO s mortgage indenture. BGE s restricted cash primarily represented funds restricted at its consolidated variable interest entity for repayment of rate
stabilization bonds and cash collateral held from suppliers. PHI Corporate s restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented funds restricted for the payment of merger commitments and cash collateral held from its utility suppliers.
Pepco s restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented funds restricted for the payment of merger commitments and collateral held from its utility suppliers. DPL s restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented cash
collateral held from suppliers associated with procurement contracts. ACE s restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented funds restricted at its consolidated variable interest entity for repayment of transition bonds and cash
collateral held from suppliers.    Restricted cash and cash equivalents not available to satisfy current liabilities are classified as noncurrent
assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Exelon s and Generation s NDT funds, which are designated to satisfy future decommissioning obligations, were classified as noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2016, Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI and Pepco had investments in Rabbi trusts classified as noncurrent assets.     Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (All Registrants)   
 The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the Registrants  best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the
allowance is based on accounts receivable aging  
      314  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
historical experience and other currently available information. ComEd, PECO and BGE estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed
specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. At December 31, 2015, Pepco, DPL and ACE estimated the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on specific identification of material amounts at
risk by customer and maintained a reserve based on their historical collection experience. At December 31, 2016, Pepco, DPL and ACE aligned the estimation of their allowance for uncollectible accounts to be consistent with ComEd, PECO and BGE,
as described above. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar credit quality indicators that are comprised based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the
accounts receivable balances are based on historical average charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. Utility Registrants customers  accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not
received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. Utility Registrants  customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. Utility Registrants  allowances for
uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC and NJBPU regulations. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information
regarding the regulatory recovery of uncollectible accounts receivable at ComEd.     Variable Interest Entities (All Registrants)   
 Exelon accounts for its investments in and arrangements with VIEs based on the authoritative guidance which includes the following specific requirements:  

requires an entity to qualitatively assess whether it should consolidate a VIE based on whether the entity has a controlling financial interest, meaning (1) has the power to direct matters that most significantly
impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE,    

requires an ongoing reconsideration of this assessment instead of only upon certain triggering events, and        

requires the entity that consolidates a VIE (the primary beneficiary) to disclose (1) the assets of the consolidated VIE, if they can be used to only settle specific obligations of the consolidated VIE, and
(2) the liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.    
 See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for additional information.  
  Inventories (All Registrants)     Inventory is recorded at the
lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory.      Fossil Fuel.  
Fossil fuel inventory includes natural gas held in storage, propane and oil. The costs of natural gas, propane and oil are generally included in inventory when purchased and charged to purchased power and fuel expense at weighted average cost when
used or sold.      Materials and Supplies.   Materials and supplies inventory generally includes transmission, distribution and generating
plant materials. Materials are generally charged to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to property, plant and equipment, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed or used.  
      315  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
    Emission Allowances.   Emission allowances are included in inventory (for emission
allowances exercisable in the current year) and other deferred debits (for emission allowances that are exercisable beyond one year) and charged to purchased power and fuel expense at weighted average cost as they are used in operations.  
  Marketable Securities (All Registrants)     All marketable
securities are reported at fair value. Marketable securities held in the NDT funds are classified as trading securities, and all other securities are classified as
  available-for-sale   securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation s NDT funds associated with the Regulatory Agreement Units are
included in regulatory liabilities at Exelon, ComEd and PECO and in Noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and in Noncurrent receivables from affiliates at ComEd and PECO. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on
Generation s NDT funds associated with the  Non-Regulatory  Agreement Units are included in earnings at Exelon and Generation. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, for Exelon s   available-for-sale   securities are reported in OCI. Any decline in the fair value of Exelon s
  available-for-sale   securities below the cost basis is reviewed to determine if such decline is other-than-temporary. If the decline is determined to be
other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the   available-for-sale   securities is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included
in earnings. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding ComEd s and PECO s regulatory assets and liabilities and Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 16 Asset Retirement
Obligations for information regarding marketable securities held by NDT funds.     Property, Plant and Equipment (All Registrants)   
 Property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost. Original cost includes construction-related direct labor and material costs. The Utility
Registrants also include indirect construction costs including labor and related costs of departments associated with supporting construction activities. When appropriate, original cost also includes capitalized interest for Generation and Exelon
Corporate and AFUDC for regulated property at ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to maintenance expense as
incurred.    Third parties reimburse the Utility Registrants for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in
aid of construction costs (CIAC) are recorded as a reduction to Property, plant and equipment. DOE SGIG funds reimbursed to PECO, BGE, Pepco and ACE have been accounted for as CIAC.  
 For Generation, upon retirement, the cost of property is generally charged to accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite method of
depreciation. Upon replacement of an asset, the costs to remove the asset, net of salvage, are capitalized to gross plant when incurred as part of the cost of the newly-installed asset and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new
asset. Removal costs, net of salvage, incurred for property that will not be replaced is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred.  
 For the Utility Registrants, upon retirement, the cost of property, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation in accordance with the
composite method of depreciation. The Utility Registrants  depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement, which is consistent with each utility s regulatory recovery method.
The Utility

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
Registrants  actual incurred removal costs are applied against a related regulatory liability. PECO s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred, and
recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO s regulatory recovery method.    See Note
7 Property, Plant and Equipment, Note 10 Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant and Note 25 Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding property, plant and equipment.  
  Nuclear Fuel (Exelon and Generation)     The cost of nuclear
fuel is capitalized within Property, plant and equipment and charged to fuel expense using the   unit-of-production   method. Prior to May 16, 2014, the estimated
disposal cost of SNF was established per the Standard Waste Contract with the DOE and was expensed through fuel expense at one mill ($0.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation. Effective May 16, 2014, the SNF disposal fee was set to zero by the
DOE and Exelon and Generation are not accruing any further costs related to SNF disposal fees until a new fee structure goes into effect. Certain  on-site  SNF storage costs are being reimbursed by the DOE since
a DOE (or government-owned) long-term storage facility has not been completed. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding the SNF disposal fee.  
  Nuclear Outage Costs (Exelon and Generation)     Costs
associated with nuclear outages, including planned major maintenance activities, are expensed to operating and maintenance expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment (based on the nature of the activities) in the period incurred.  
  New Site Development Costs (Exelon and Generation)     New site
development costs represent the costs incurred in the assessment and design of new power generating facilities. Such costs are capitalized when management considers project completion to be probable, primarily based on management s
determination that the project is economically and operationally feasible, management and/or the Exelon board of directors has approved the project and has committed to a plan to develop it, and Exelon and Generation have received the required
regulatory approvals or management believes the receipt of required regulatory approvals is probable. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Generation has capitalized $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, to Property, plant
and equipment, net on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized development costs are charged to Operating and maintenance expense when project completion is no longer probable. New site development costs incurred prior to a project s
completion being deemed probable are expensed as incurred. Approximately $30 million, $22 million and $13 million of costs were expensed by Exelon and Generation for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014,
respectively. These costs are primarily related to the possible development of new power generating facilities with the exception of approximately $13 million of costs expensed in 2016 which relate to projects for which completion is no longer
probable.     Capitalized Software Costs (All Registrants)     Costs incurred
during the application development stage of software projects that are internally developed or purchased for operational use are capitalized within property, plant, and equipment. Such  
      317  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed five years. Certain other capitalized software costs are
being amortized over longer lives based on the expected life or pursuant to prescribed regulatory requirements. The following table presents net unamortized capitalized software costs and amortization of capitalized software costs by year:  

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (All Registrants)   
 Except for the amortization of nuclear fuel, depreciation is generally recorded over the estimated service lives of property, plant and equipment on a
straight-line basis using the composite method in which depreciation is calculated using the average estimated service life of assets within a group. The Utility Registrants  depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and
removing plant from service upon retirement, which is consistent with each utility s regulatory recovery method. The estimated service lives for the Utility Registrants are primarily based on each company s most recent depreciation studies
of historical asset retirement and removal cost experience. At Generation, along with depreciation study results, management considers expected future energy market conditions and generation plant operating costs and capital investment requirements
in determining the estimated service lives of its generating facilities. For its nuclear generating facilities, except for Oyster Creek and Clinton, Generation estimates each unit will operate through the full term of its initial  20-year  operating license renewal period. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements for additional information on the impacts of expected and potential early plant retirements. The estimated service lives of
Generation s hydroelectric generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a license renewal extension of 40 years.  
 See Note 7 Property, Plant and Equipment for further information regarding depreciation.  
 Amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded over the recovery or refund period specified in the related legislation or regulatory
order or agreement. When the recovery or refund period is less than one year, amortization is recorded to the line item in which the deferred cost or income would have originally been recorded in the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of
Operations  
      318  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
and Comprehensive Income. Amortization of ComEd s distribution formula rate regulatory asset and ComEd s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s transmission formula
rate regulatory assets is recorded to Operating revenues.    Amortization of income tax related regulatory assets and liabilities are generally
recorded to Income tax expense. With the exception of the regulatory assets and liabilities discussed above, when the recovery period is more than one year, the amortization is generally recorded to Depreciation and amortization in the
Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.    See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 25 Supplemental
Financial Information for additional information regarding Generation s nuclear fuel, Generation s ARC and the amortization of the Utility Registrants  regulatory assets.  
  Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)     The
authoritative guidance for accounting for AROs requires the recognition of a liability for a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even though the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. To
estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a
  unit-by-unit   basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost
escalation rates, probabilistic future cash flow models and discount rates. Generation generally updates its ARO annually, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of
cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various decommissioning scenarios. Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation s nuclear units at least every five years unless circumstances
warrant more frequent updates (such as a change in assumed operating life for a nuclear plant). As part of the annual cost study update process, Generation evaluates newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously assumed costs to determine
if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimates to the AROs across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five-year rotating cost study update cycle. The liabilities associated with
Exelon s  non-nuclear  AROs are adjusted on an ongoing rotational basis, at least once every five years unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates. Changes to the recorded value of an ARO result
from the passage of new laws and regulations, revisions to either the timing or amount of estimated undiscounted cash flows, and estimates of cost escalation factors. AROs are accreted throughout each year to reflect the time value of money for
these present value obligations through a charge to Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or, in the case of the Utility Registrants  accretion, through an increase to regulatory
assets. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.     Capitalized Interest and AFUDC (All Registrants)   
 During construction, Exelon and Generation capitalize the costs of debt funds used to finance  non-regulated 
construction projects. Capitalization of debt funds is recorded as a charge to construction work in progress and as a  non-cash  credit to interest expense.  
 Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE apply the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation to calculate AFUDC,
which is the cost, during the period of construction, of debt and equity funds used to finance construction projects for regulated operations.  
      319  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
AFUDC is recorded to construction work in progress and as a  non-cash  credit to AFUDC that is included in interest expense for debt-related funds and other
income and deductions for equity-related funds. The rates used for capitalizing AFUDC are computed under a method prescribed by regulatory authorities.  
 The following table summarizes total incurred interest, capitalized interest and credits to AFUDC by year:  

(a) 
 On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, the 2014 financial results include CENG s financial position and results of operations beginning
April 1, 2014.    

(b) 
 Includes interest expense to affiliates.       Guarantees (All Registrants)   
 The Registrants recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair market value of the obligations they have undertaken by issuing the
guarantee, including the ongoing obligation to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur.  
 The liability that is initially recognized at the inception of the guarantee is reduced as the Registrants are released from risk under the guarantee.
Depending on the nature of the guarantee, the release from risk of the Registrant may be recognized only upon the expiration or settlement of the guarantee or by a systematic and rational amortization method over the term of the guarantee. See Note
24 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.     Asset Impairments (All Registrants)   
   Long-Lived Assets.   The Registrants evaluate the carrying value of their long-lived assets or asset groups, excluding goodwill, when
circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may  
      320  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, specific regulatory
disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. The Registrants determine if long-lived assets and asset groups are impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the
carrying value. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset
group over its fair value less costs to sell.    Cash flows for long-lived assets and asset groups are determined at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The cash flows from the generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level along with cash flows generated from the customer
supply and risk management activities, including cash flows from related intangible assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. In certain cases, generating assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a
long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generation assets (typically contracted renewables). See Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for additional information.  
   Goodwill.   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 11 Intangible Assets for additional information regarding Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s and PHI s goodwill.  
   Equity Method Investments.   Exelon and Generation regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they are
impaired. An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature. Additionally, if the project in which Generation holds an investment recognizes an impairment loss, Exelon and
Generation would record their proportionate share of that impairment loss and evaluate the investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value.  
   Debt and Equity Security Investments.   Exelon and Generation regularly monitor and evaluate debt and equity investments to determine
whether they are impaired. An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature.     Derivative
Financial Instruments (All Registrants)     All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for certain
exceptions, including the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Additionally, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an
unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge) or hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). For fair value hedges, changes in fair values
for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the cost or value of the underlying
exposure is deferred in AOCI and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. For derivative contracts intended to serve
as economic hedges and that are not  
      321

designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchases and normal sales exception, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period, except
for the Utility Registrants where changes in fair value may be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability if there is an ability to recover or return the associated costs. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Derivative Financial
Instruments for additional information. Amounts classified in earnings are included in revenue, purchased power and fuel, interest expense or other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income based on the activity
the transaction is economically hedging. For energy-related derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, which are subject to Exelon s Risk Management Policy, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings
each period. All amounts classified in earnings related to proprietary trading are included in revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as
a component of operating, investing or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of each transaction.  
 For commodity derivative contracts Generation no longer utilizes the election provided for by the cash flow hedge designation and  de-designated  all of its existing cash flow hedges prior to the March 2012 merger of Exelon and Constellation. Because the underlying forecasted transactions at that time remained probable, the fair value of the
effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in AOCI and was reclassified to results of operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurred through March 31, 2015. Accordingly, all derivatives executed to
hedge economic risk related to commodities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings for the combined company.  
 As part of Generation s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its
customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the energy markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery of the underlying physical commodity.
Normal purchases and normal sales are contracts where physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and will not be financially settled. Revenues and
expenses on derivative contracts that qualify, and are designated, as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments, they
are not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather are recorded on an accrual basis of accounting. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.  
  Retirement Benefits (All Registrants)     Exelon sponsors
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for essentially all employees.    The measurement of the plan obligations and
costs of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and inputs and accounting elections. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. The impact of
assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
Gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits for
additional information.

   Equity Investment Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Affiliates (Exelon and Generation)   
 Exelon and Generation include equity in earnings from equity method investments in qualifying facilities, power projects and joint ventures, in equity in
earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates within their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates also includes any adjustments to amortize the difference, if any,
except for goodwill and land, between the cost in an equity method investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment.  
  New Accounting Standards (All Registrants)       New
Accounting Standards Adopted:   in 2016 the Registrants have adopted the following new authoritative accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Unless otherwise indicated, adoption of the guidance in each instance had no or insignificant impacts
on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures.  
  Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Issued May 2015; Adopted first quarter 2016 retrospectively
to all prior periods presented):      Removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and instead provides
for such investments to be disclosed as a reconciling item between the fair value hierarchy disclosure and the investment line item on the Balance Sheet. The guidance also simplified the disclosure requirements for investments valued using the
practical expedient. See Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for the disclosure impacts.     Customer     s
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (Issued April 2015; Adopted first quarter 2016 prospectively):  Clarifies the circumstances under which a cloud computing customer would account for the arrangement as a license of  internal-use  software. A cloud computing arrangement would include a software license if (1) the customer has a contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without
significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. If the arrangement does not contain a software license,
it would be accounted for as a service contract.     Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Issued February 2015; Adopted
January     1, 2016):  Amends the consolidation analysis for variable interest entities (VIEs) and voting interest entities. The new guidance primarily (1) changes the VIE assessment of limited partnerships, (2) amends
the effect that fees paid to a decision maker or service provider have on the VIE analysis, (3) amends how variable interests held by a reporting entity s related parties and de facto agents impact its consolidation conclusion,
(4) clarifies how to determine whether equity holders (as a group) have power over an entity, and (5) provides a scope exception for registered and similar unregistered money market funds. The Registrants did not revise any consolidation
conclusions as a result of the guidance, but did identify additional entities that are now considered VIEs. See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for the associated disclosures.  
  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting (Issued March 2016; Early adopted fourth quarter 2016):  Eliminates the requirement
to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level ownership or degree of influence of an existing investment.  
      323  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
Instead, an investor now adds the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopts the equity method of
accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for such treatment.     Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting
Relationships (Issued March 2016; Early adopted fourth quarter 2016 prospectively):  Clarifies that a change in the counterparty of a derivative contract does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedge accounting relationship as
long as all of the other hedge accounting criteria are met.     Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Issued July 2015; Early adopted fourth
quarter 2016 prospectively):  Requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs
of completion, disposal and transportation. This definition is consistent with existing authoritative guidance. Current guidance requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or market where market could be replacement cost, net realizable
value or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin.     Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (Issued March
2016; Adopted January     1, 2017 on a modified retrospective basis):  Simplifies the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments containing contingent call or put options by removing the requirement to assess whether a
contingent event is related to interest rates or credit risks. The guidance clarifies that a contingent put or call option embedded in a debt instrument would be evaluated for possible separate accounting as a derivative instrument without regard to
the nature of the exercise contingency. The guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all existing and future debt instruments.  
  Interests Held through Related Parties that are Under Common Control (Issued October 2016; Adopted January     1, 2017 on a
retrospective basis to January 1, 2016):  Requires consideration of indirect interests held through related parties under common control proportionately when determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Issued March 2016; Adopted January     1, 2017 using either the
prospective, modified retrospective, or retrospective method as prescribed by the standard):  Simplifies various aspects of how share-based payment awards to employees are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The new guidance
eliminates additional  paid-in  capital pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
   New Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Adopted:   The following new authoritative accounting guidance issued by the FASB has not yet
been adopted and reflected by the Registrants in their consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise indicated, the Registrants are currently assessing the impacts such guidance may have (which could be material) on their Consolidated Balance
Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures, as well as the potential to early adopt where applicable. The Registrants have assessed other FASB issuances of new
standards which are not listed below given the current expectation such standards will not significantly impact the Registrants  financial reporting.  
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Issued May 2014 and subsequently amended to address implementation questions):  Changes the criteria for
recognizing revenue from a contract with a  
      324

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
customer. The new revenue recognition guidance, including subsequent amendments, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, with the option to early
adopt the standard for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Registrants do not plan to early adopt the standard.    The
new standard replaces existing guidance on revenue recognition, including most industry specific guidance, with a five step model for recognizing and measuring revenue from contracts with customers. The objective of the new standard is to provide a
single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires a number of disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty
of revenue and the related cash flows. In addition, the Registrants will be required to capitalize costs to acquire new contracts, and amortize such costs in a manner consistent with the transfer to the customer of the associated goods or services.
Exelon currently expenses those costs as incurred. The guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for
initial application of the guidance at the date of initial adoption (modified retrospective method).    The Registrants continue to assess the impacts
this guidance may have on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures. In performing this assessment, the Registrants have utilized a
project implementation team comprised of both internal and external resources to conduct the following key activities:      

Actively participate in the AICPA Power and Utilities Industry Task Force (Industry Task Force) process to identify implementation issues and support the development of related implementation guidance;

Evaluate existing contracts and revenue streams for potential changes in the amounts and timing of recognizing revenues under the new guidance;    

Evaluate and select the transition method; and        

Develop and implement the approach and process for complying with the new revenue recognition disclosure requirements.    
 While there continues to be some ongoing activities in all of these areas, the Registrants have substantially completed the evaluation of their
collective contracts and revenue streams, as well as the evaluation of the transition method. Based on the work completed thus far, the Registrants have reached the following preliminary conclusions:  

The Registrants expect to apply the new guidance using the full retrospective method, however this conclusion could change based on the outcome of open implementation issues discussed below;    

The Registrants currently anticipate that the implementation of the new guidance will not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognition; and    

The Registrants expect the new guidance will result in more detailed disclosures of revenue compared to current guidance.    
      325

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  Notwithstanding the preliminary conclusions noted above, certain implementation issues continue to be
debated and worked through the Industry Task Force process that could result in amendments to the standard or implementation guidance that could have a material impact on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures. The open implementation issues that could be most impactful to the Registrants include: (1) the ability of the Utility Registrants to recognize revenue
for certain contracts where collectability is in question, (2) the accounting by the Utility Registrants for contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) and whether CIAC arrangements are within the scope of the revenue guidance and
(3) primarily at Generation, bundled sales contracts and contracts with pricing provisions that may require recognition of revenue at prices other than the contract price (e.g., straight line or estimated future market prices). As part of the
overall implementation project, the Registrants are developing alternative adoption plans that would be implemented in the event the ultimate resolution of the open implementation issues result in significant changes from current revenue recognition
practices.     Leases (Issued February 2016):  Increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease
liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance requires lessees to recognize both the   right-of-use   assets and
lease liabilities in the balance sheet for most leases, whereas today only financing type lease liabilities (capital leases) are recognized in the balance sheet. This is expected to require significant changes to systems, processes and procedures in
order to recognize and measure leases recorded on the balance sheet that are currently classified as operating leases. In addition, the definition of a lease has been revised in regards to when an arrangement conveys the right to control the use of
the identified asset under the arrangement which may result in changes to the classification of an arrangement as a lease. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not
significantly changed from current GAAP. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under current GAAP. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted,
however the Registrants do not expect to early adopt the standard. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note
24 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding operating leases.     Impairment of Financial Instruments (Issued June
2016):      Provides for a new Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) impairment model for specified financial instruments including loans, trade receivables, debt securities classified as   held-to-maturity   investments and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. Under the new guidance, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance
that reflects the entity s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The standard does not make changes to the existing impairment models for
 non-financial  assets such as fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill. The standard will be effective January 1, 2020 and, for most debt instruments, requires a modified retrospective transition approach
through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.     Goodwill Impairment (issued January
2017):  Simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the current test, which requires calculation of a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the revised guidance, goodwill impairment will be measured as the
amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill (currently Step 1 of the two step impairment test). Entities will continue to have the option to perform a
 
      326

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Exelon, ComEd, Generation, and DPL have goodwill as of December 31, 2016. This updated guidance is not
currently expected to impact the Registrants  financial reporting. The standard is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a prospective basis.  
  Clarifying the Definition of a Business (issued January 2017):  Clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of addressing whether
acquisitions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as acquisitions of businesses. If substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable
assets, the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. If the fair value of the assets acquired is not concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then an entity must evaluate whether
an input and a substantive process exist, which together significantly contribute to the ability to produce outputs. The standard also revises the definition of outputs to focus on goods and services to customers. The standard could result
in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions. The standard will be effective January 1, 2018 and will be applied prospectively.  
  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (Issued October 2016):  Requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an
intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs (compared to current GAAP which prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an
outside party). The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly
to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.     Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments (Issued August 2016) and Restricted Cash (Issued November 2016):  In 2016, the FASB issued two standards impacting the Statement of Cash Flows. The first adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and
payments on the statement of cash flows as follows: debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of  zero-coupon  bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from
the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interest in securitization
transactions, and the application of the predominance principle to separately identifiable cash flows. The second states that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash
equivalents when reconciling the   beginning-of-period   and   end-of-period   total amounts
shown on the statement of cash flows (instead of being presented as cash flow activities). Exelon will adopt both standards on January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. Adoption of the second standard will result in a change in presentation of
restricted cash on the face of the Statement of Cash Flows; otherwise the Registrants expect that adoption of the guidance will have insignificant impacts on the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures.  
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Issued January 2016):  (i) requires all investments in equity
securities, including other ownership interests such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies, to be carried at fair value through net income, (ii) requires an incremental recognition and disclosure
requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, (iii) amends several disclosure requirements, including the methods and significant assumptions used to
estimate fair value or a description of the changes in the methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value, and (iv) requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at

amortized cost at the amount that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with
early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for initial application of the guidance at the date of adoption (modified retrospective method).  
    2. Variable Interest Entities (All Registrants)   
 A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following characteristics: an insufficient amount of equity at risk to finance its activities, equity
owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or equity owners who do not have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right
to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. Companies are required to consolidate a VIE if they are its primary beneficiary, which is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the
entity s economic performance.    At December 31, 2016, Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI, and ACE collectively consolidated nine VIEs or VIE
groups, for which the applicable Registrant was the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2015, Exelon, Generation and BGE collectively had seven consolidated VIEs or VIE groups and PHI and ACE had one consolidated VIE ( see Consolidated
Variable Interest Entities below) . As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Exelon and Generation collectively had significant interests in eight other VIEs for which the applicable Registrant does not have the power to direct
the entities  activities and, accordingly, was not the primary beneficiary ( see Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities below) .      Consolidated
Variable Interest Entities      The carrying amounts and classification of the consolidated VIEs  assets and liabilities included in the
Registrants  consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:      

(a) 
 Includes certain purchase accounting adjustments not pushed down to the BGE standalone entity.    

(b) 
 Includes certain purchase accounting adjustments not pushed down to the ACE standalone entity.      Except
as specifically noted below, the assets in the table above are restricted for settlement of the VIE obligations and the liabilities in the table can only be settled using VIE resources.  
      328  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  Exelon s, Generation s, BGE s, PHI s and ACE s consolidated VIEs consist of:
    RSB BondCo LLC.    In 2007, BGE formed RSB BondCo LLC (BondCo), a special purpose bankruptcy remote limited liability company, to
acquire and hold rate stabilization property and to issue and service bonds secured by the rate stabilization property. In June 2007, BondCo purchased rate stabilization property from BGE, including the right to assess, collect, and receive  non-bypassable  rate stabilization charges payable by all residential electric customers of BGE. These charges are being assessed in order to recover previously incurred power purchase costs that BGE deferred
pursuant to Senate Bill 1. BGE has determined that BondCo is a VIE for which it is the primary beneficiary. As a result, BGE consolidates BondCo.  
 BondCo s assets are restricted and can only be used to settle the obligations of BondCo. Further, BGE is required to remit all payments it receives
from customers for rate stabilization charges to BondCo. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, BGE remitted $86 million, $86 million and $85 million, respectively, to BondCo.  
 BGE did not provide any additional financial support to BondCo during 2016. Further, BGE does not have any contractual commitments or obligations to
provide additional financial support to BondCo unless additional rate stabilization bonds are issued. The BondCo creditors do not have any recourse to the general credit of BGE in the event the rate stabilization charges are not sufficient to cover
the bond principal and interest payments of BondCo.     ACE Transition Funding . A special purpose entity formed by ACE for the purpose of
securitizing authorized portions of ACE s recoverable stranded costs through the issuance and sale of transition bonds. Proceeds from the sale of each series of transition bonds by ATF were transferred to ACE in exchange for the transfer by ACE
to ATF of the right to collect a  non-bypassable  Transition Bond Charge from ACE customers pursuant to bondable stranded costs rate orders issued by the NJBPU in an amount sufficient to fund the principal and
interest payments on transition bonds and related taxes, expenses and fees. During the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, ACE transferred $60 million, $61 million and $55 million to ATF, respectively.  
  Retail Gas Group.    During 2009, Constellation formed two new entities, which now are part of Generation, and combined them with its
existing retail gas activities into a retail gas entity group for the purpose of entering into a collateralized gas supply agreement with a third-party gas supplier. While Generation owns 100% of these entities, it has been determined that the
retail gas entity group is a VIE because there is not sufficient equity to fund the group s activities without the additional credit support that is provided in the form of a parental guarantee. Generation is the primary beneficiary of the
retail gas entity group; accordingly, Generation consolidates the retail gas entity group as a VIE.    The third-party gas supply arrangement is
collateralized as follows:      

the assets of the retail gas entity group must be used to settle obligations under the third-party gas supply agreement before it can make any distributions to Generation,    

the third-party gas supplier has a collateral interest in all of the assets and equity of the retail gas entity group, and        

Generation provides a $75 million parental guarantee to the third-party gas supplier and provides limited recourse to other third-party suppliers and customers in support of the retail gas group.    

      329  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  Other than credit support provided by the parental guarantee, Exelon or Generation do not have any
contractual or other obligations to provide additional financial support under the collateralized third-party gas supply agreement. The third-party gas supply creditors do not have any recourse to Exelon s or Generation s general credit
other than the parental guarantee.     Solar Project Entity Group.  In 2011, Generation acquired all of the equity interests in Antelope
Valley Solar Ranch One (Antelope Valley) from First Solar, Inc., a  242-MW  solar PV project in northern Los Angeles County, California. In addition, Generation owns a number of limited liability companies that
build, own, and operate solar power facilities. While Generation owns 100% of these entities, it has been determined that certain of the individual solar project entities are VIEs because the entities require additional subordinated financial
support in the form of a parental guarantee of debt, loans from the customers in order to obtain the necessary funds for construction of the solar facilities, or the customers absorb price variability from the entities through the fixed price power
and/or REC purchase agreements. Generation is the primary beneficiary of the solar project entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation controls the design, construction, and operation of the solar power facilities. Generation provides operating
and capital funding to the solar entities for ongoing construction, operations and maintenance of the solar power facilities and there is limited recourse related to Generation related to certain solar entities. In addition, these solar VIE entities
have an aggregate amount of outstanding debt with third parties of $568 million, as of December 31, 2016, for which the creditors have no recourse to Generation. For additional information on these project-specific financing arrangements
refer to Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements.     Retail Power and Gas Companies.  In March 2014, Generation began consolidating retail
power and gas VIEs for which Generation is the primary beneficiary as a result of energy supply contracts that give Generation the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the entities. Generation
does not have an equity ownership interest in these entities, but provides approximately $21 million in credit support for the retail power and gas companies for which Generation is the sole supplier of energy. These entities are included in
Generation s consolidated financial statements, and the consolidation of the VIEs do not have a material impact on Generation s financial results or financial condition.  
  Wind Project Entity Group . Generation owns and operates a number of wind project limited liability entities, the majority of which were
acquired during 2010 with the acquisition of all of the equity interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC (now known as Exelon Wind). Generation has evaluated the significant agreements and ownership structures and the risks of each of its wind
projects and underlying entities, and determined that certain of the entities are VIEs because either the projects have noncontrolling equity interest holders that absorb variability from the wind projects, or the customers absorb price variability
from the entities through the fixed price power and/or REC purchase agreements. Generation is the primary beneficiary of the wind project entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation controls the design, construction, and operation of the wind
generation facilities.    In December 2016, Generation sold approximately 71% of its equity interest in one of its wind projects that was previously
consolidated under the voting interest model to a tax equity investor. The wind project was evaluated and it was determined to be a VIE because the company has a similar structure to a limited partnership and the limited partners do not have  kick-out  rights with respect to the general partner. While Generation is the minority interest holder, Generation is the primary beneficiary, because Generation manages the   day-to-day   activities of the entity. Therefore, the entity continues to be consolidated by Generation.

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  While Generation owns 100% of the majority of the wind project entities, six of the projects have
noncontrolling equity interests of 1% held by third parties and one of the projects has noncontrolling equity interests of approximately 71%. Regarding the projects with noncontrolling equity interests of 1% held by third parties, Generation s
current economic interests in five of these projects is significantly greater than its stated contractual governance rights and all of these projects have reversionary interest provisions that provide the noncontrolling interest holder with a
purchase option, certain of which are considered bargain purchase prices, which, if exercised, transfers ownership of the projects to the noncontrolling interest holder upon either the passage of time or the achievement of targeted financial
returns. The ownership agreements with the noncontrolling interests state that Generation is to provide financial support to the projects in proportion to its current 99% economic interests in the projects. Generation provides operating and
capital funding to the wind project entities for ongoing construction, operations and maintenance of the wind power and there is limited recourse to Generation related to certain wind project entities. However, no additional support to these
projects beyond what was contractually required has been provided during 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that are consolidated as a result of Generation being the primary beneficiary of the wind
VIE entities primarily relates to the wind generating assets, PPA intangible assets and working capital amounts.     Other Generating
Facilities.  During the second quarter of 2015, Generation formed a limited liability company to build, own, and operate a backup generator. While Generation owns 100% of the backup generator company, it was determined that the entity is a
VIE because the customer absorbs price variability from the entity through the fixed price backup generator agreement. Generation provides operating and capital funding to the backup generator company. Generation also owns 90% of a biomass fueled,
combined heat and power company. In the second quarter of 2015, the entity was deemed to be a VIE because the entity requires additional subordinated financial support in the form of a parental guarantee provided by Generation for up to
$275 million in support of the payment obligations related to the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract for the facility in support of one of its other generating facilities (see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for
additional details on Albany Green Energy, LLC). In addition to the parental guarantee, Generation provides operating and capital funding to the biomass fueled, combined heat and power company. Generation is the primary beneficiary of both entities
since Generation has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the entities.     CENG.
 Through March 31, 2014, CENG was operated as a joint venture with EDF and was governed by a board of ten directors, five of which were appointed by Generation and five by EDF. CENG was designed to operate under joint and equal control of
Generation and EDF through the Board of Directors, subject to the Chairman of the Board s final decision making authority on certain special matters; therefore, CENG was not subject to VIE guidance. Accordingly, Generation s 50.01%
interest in CENG was accounted for as an equity method investment. On April 1, 2014, Generation, CENG, and subsidiaries of CENG executed the Nuclear Operating Services Agreement (NOSA) pursuant to which Generation now conducts all activities
associated with the operations of the CENG fleet and provides corporate and administrative services to CENG and the CENG fleet for the remaining life of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear fleet, subject to the
CENG member rights of EDF. As a result of executing the NOSA, CENG now qualifies as a VIE due to the disproportionate relationship between Generation s 50.01% equity ownership interest and its role in conducting the operational activities of
CENG and the CENG fleet conveyed through the NOSA. Further, since Generation is conducting the operational activities of CENG and the CENG fleet, Generation qualifies as the primary beneficiary of CENG and, therefore, is required to consolidate the
financial position and results of operations of CENG. On April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation

derecognized Generation s equity method investment in CENG and reflected all assets, liabilities, and the EDF noncontrolling interests in CENG at fair value on the consolidated balance
sheets of Exelon and Generation, resulting in the recognition of a $261 million gain in their respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.  
 Generation and Exelon, where indicated, provide the following support to CENG (see Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC and
Note 27 Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding Generation s and Exelon s transactions with CENG):      

under the NOSA, Generation conducts all activities related to the operation of the CENG nuclear generation fleet owned by CENG subsidiaries (the CENG fleet) and provides corporate and administrative services for the
remaining life and decommissioning of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear fleet, subject to the CENG member rights of EDF,        

under the Power Services Agency Agreement (PSAA), Generation provides scheduling, asset management, and billing services to the CENG fleet for the remaining operating life of the CENG nuclear plants,    

under power purchase agreements with CENG, Generation purchased or will purchase 50.01% of the available output generated by the CENG nuclear plants not subject to other contractual agreements from January 2015 through
the end of the operating life of each respective plant. However, pursuant to amendments dated March 31, 2015, the energy obligations under the Ginna Nuclear Power Plant (Ginna) PPAs have been suspended during the term of the Reliability Support
Services Agreement (RSSA) (see Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional details),        

Generation provided a $400 million loan to CENG. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining obligation is $316 million, including accrued interest, which reflects the principal payment made in January 2015,

Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in
connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation s obligations under this Indemnity Agreement. (See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies for more details),    

in connection with CENG s severance obligations, Generation reimbursed CENG for a total of approximately $6 million of the severance benefits paid from 2014 through 2016. The final reimbursement was made in
2016, and there was no remaining obligation as of December 31, 2016.        

Generation and EDF share in the $637 million of contingent payment obligations for the payment of contingent retrospective premium adjustments for the nuclear liability insurance,    

Generation provides a guarantee of approximately $7 million associated with hazardous waste management facilities and underground storage tanks. In addition, EDF executed a reimbursement agreement that provides
reimbursement to Exelon for 49.99% of any amounts paid by Generation under this guarantee,        

Generation and EDF are the members-insured with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited and have assigned the loss benefits under the insurance and the NEIL premium costs to CENG and guarantee the obligations of CENG under
these insurance programs in proportion to their respective member interests (See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies for more details), and    
      332

Exelon has executed an agreement to provide up to $245 million to support the operations of CENG as well as a $165 million guarantee of CENG s cash pooling agreement with its subsidiaries.
      2015 ESA Investco, LLC.  In June 2015, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into an
arrangement to purchase a 90% equity interest and 99% of the tax attributes of another distributed energy company. In November 2015, Generation sold 69% of its equity interest in 2015 ESA Investco, LLC to a tax equity investor. Generation and the
tax equity investor will contribute up to a total of $250 million of equity incrementally from inception through the first quarter of 2017 in proportion to their ownership interests, which is up to $172 million for the tax equity investor
and up to $78 million for Generation (see Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies for more details). The investment in the distributed energy company was evaluated, and it was determined to be a VIE for which Generation is not the primary
beneficiary (see additional details in the Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities section below). As of December 31, 2015, Generation consolidated 2015 ESA Investco, LLC under the voting interest model. Pursuant to the new consolidation
guidance effective January 1, 2016, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC meets the definition of a VIE because the company has a similar structure to a limited partnership and the limited partners do not have  kick-out 
rights with respect to the general partner. Under VIE guidance, Generation is the primary beneficiary; therefore, the entity continues to be consolidated.  
 For each of the consolidated VIEs, except as otherwise noted:      

the assets of the VIEs are restricted and can only be used to settle obligations of the respective VIE;        

Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI and ACE did not provide any additional material financial support to the VIEs;        

Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI and ACE did not have any material contractual commitments or obligations to provide financial support to the VIEs; and    

the creditors of the VIEs did not have recourse to Exelon s, Generation s, BGE s, PHI s or ACE s general credit.    
 As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, ComEd, PECO, Pepco and DPL do not have any material consolidated VIEs.

   Assets and Liabilities of Consolidated VIEs   
 Included within the balances above are assets and liabilities of certain consolidated VIEs for which the assets can only be used to settle obligations of
those VIEs, and liabilities that creditors, or beneficiaries, do not have recourse to the general credit of the Registrants. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, these assets and liabilities primarily consisted of the following:

(a) 
 Includes certain purchase accounting adjustments not pushed down to the BGE standalone entity.    

(b) 
 Includes certain purchase accounting adjustments not pushed down to the ACE standalone entity.

 Includes the CNEG retail gas pension obligation, which is presented as a net asset balance within the Prepaid pension asset line item on Generation s balance sheet. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits for
additional details.       Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities   
 Exelon s and Generation s variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs generally include equity investments and energy purchase and sale
contracts. For the equity investments, the carrying amount of the investments is reflected on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets in Investments. For the energy purchase and sale contracts (commercial agreements), the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to their involvement with the VIEs are predominately related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts
owed by, or owed to, Exelon and Generation for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycles under the commercial agreements. Further, Exelon and Generation have not provided material debt or equity support, liquidity arrangements or
performance guarantees associated with these commercial agreements.    As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Exelon and Generation had significant
unconsolidated variable interests in eight VIEs for which Exelon or Generation, as applicable, was not the primary beneficiary; including certain equity method investments and certain commercial agreements. Exelon and Generation only include
unconsolidated VIEs that are individually material in the tables below. However, Generation has several individually immaterial VIEs that in aggregate represent a total investment of $18 million. These immaterial VIEs are equity and debt
securities in energy development companies. The maximum exposure to loss related to these securities is limited to the $18 million included in Investments on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
 The following tables present summary information about Exelon and Generation s significant unconsolidated VIE entities:  

335

(a) 
 These items represent amounts on the unconsolidated VIE balance sheets, not on Exelon s or Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These items are included to provide information regarding the relative size
of the unconsolidated VIEs.    

(b) 
 These items represent amounts on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the asset sale agreement with ZionSolutions, LLC. The net assets pledged for Zion Station decommissioning
includes gross pledged assets of $113 million and $206 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively; offset by payables to ZionSolutions LLC of $104 million and $189 million as of
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These items are included to provide information regarding the relative size of the ZionSolutions LLC unconsolidated VIE.    
 For each unconsolidated VIE, Exelon and Generation assessed the risk of a loss equal to their maximum exposure to be remote and, accordingly Exelon and
Generation have not recognized a liability associated with any portion of the maximum exposure to loss. In addition, there are no agreements with, or commitments by, third parties that would materially affect the fair value or risk of their variable
interests in these variable interest entities.    The Registrants  unconsolidated VIEs consist of:  
  Energy Purchase and Sale Agreements.  Generation has several energy purchase and sale agreements with generating facilities. Generation has
evaluated the significant agreements, ownership structures and risks of each entity, and determined that certain of the entities are VIEs because the entity absorbs risk through the sale of fixed price power and renewable energy credits. Generation
has reviewed the entities and has determined that Generation is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because Generation does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance.  
  ZionSolutions . Generation has an asset sale agreement with EnergySolutions, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including ZionSolutions,
LLC (ZionSolutions), which is further discussed in Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations. Under this agreement, ZionSolutions can put the assets and liabilities back to Generation when decommissioning activities under the asset sale agreement
are complete. Generation has evaluated this agreement and determined that, through the put option, it has a variable interest in ZionSolutions but is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, Generation has concluded that consolidation is not
required. Other than the asset sale agreement, Exelon and Generation do not have any contractual or other obligations to provide additional financial support and ZionSolutions  creditors do not have any recourse to Exelon s or
Generation s general credit.     Investment in Energy Development Projects, Distributed Energy Companies, and Energy Generating
Facilities.  Generation has several equity investments in energy development projects and energy generating facilities. Generation has evaluated the significant agreements, ownership structures and risks of each of its equity investments,
and determined that certain of the entities are  
      336

VIEs because the entity has an insufficient amount of equity at risk to finance its activities, Generation guarantees the debt of the entity, provides equity support, or provides operating
services to the entity. Generation has reviewed the entities and has determined that Generation is not the primary beneficiary of the entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation does not have the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact the VIEs economic performance.    In July 2014, Generation entered into an arrangement to purchase a 90% equity interest and 90%
of the tax attributes of a distributed energy company. Generation s total equity commitment in this arrangement was $85 million and was paid incrementally over an approximate two year period (see Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies
for additional details). This arrangement did not meet the definition of a VIE and was recorded as an equity method investment. However, pursuant to the new consolidation guidance effective as of January 1, 2016 for the Registrants, the
distributed energy company meets the definition of a VIE because the company has a similar structure to a limited partnership and the limited partners do not have  kick-out  rights of the general partner. (For
additional details related to the new consolidation guidance, see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies.) Generation is not the primary beneficiary; therefore, the investment continues to be recorded using the equity method.  
 In June 2015, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into an arrangement to purchase a 90% equity interest and
99% of the tax attributes of another distributed energy company. Separate from the equity investment, Generation provided $27 million in cash to the other (10%) equity holder in the distributed energy company in exchange for a convertible
promissory note. In November 2015, Generation sold 69% of its equity interest in 2015 ESA Investco, LLC to a tax equity investor. Generation and the tax equity investor will contribute up to a total of $250 million of equity incrementally
through the first quarter of 2017 in proportion to their ownership interests, which is up to $172 million for the tax equity investor and up to $78 million for Generation (see Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies for additional
details). Generation and the tax equity investor provide a parental guarantee of up to $275 million in proportion to their ownership interests in support of 2015 ESA Investco, LLC s obligation to make equity contributions to the
distributed energy company. The investment in the distributed energy company was evaluated and it was determined to be a VIE for which Generation is not the primary beneficiary. See additional details in the Consolidated Variable Interest Entities
section above.    Both distributed energy companies from the 2015 and 2014 arrangements are considered related parties.  
  ComEd, PECO and BGE     The financing trust of ComEd, ComEd
Financing III, the financing trusts of PECO, PECO Trust III and PECO Trust IV, and the financing trust of BGE, BGE Capital Trust II, are not consolidated in Exelon s, ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s financial statements. These financing
trusts were created to issue mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. ComEd, PECO, and BGE have concluded that they do not have a significant variable interest in ComEd Financing III, PECO Trust III, PECO Trust IV or BGE Capital Trust II
as each Registrant financed its equity interest in the financing trusts through the issuance of subordinated debt and, therefore, has no equity at risk. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information.

     3. Regulatory Matters (All Registrants)   
 The following matters below discuss the current status of material regulatory and legislative proceedings of the Registrants.  
  Illinois Regulatory Matters       Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act
(Exelon and ComEd).       Background     Since 2011,
ComEd s electric distribution rates are established through a performance-based formula rate, pursuant to EIMA. EIMA also provides a structure for substantial capital investment by utilities to modernize Illinois  electric utility
infrastructure.    Participating utilities are required to file an annual update to the performance-based formula rate on or before May 1, with
resulting rates effective in January of the following year. This annual electric distribution formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial revenue requirement). The update also
reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year (annual reconciliation). See  Annual Electric Distribution Filings  below for further details. Throughout each year,
ComEd records regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and corresponding increases or decreases to Operating revenues for any differences between the revenue requirement in effect and ComEd s best estimate of the revenue requirement expected
to be approved by the ICC for that year s reconciliation. As of December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, ComEd had a regulatory asset associated with the electric distribution formula rate of $188 million and $189 million,
respectively. The regulatory asset associated with electric distribution formula rate is amortized to Operating revenues in ComEd s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as the associated amounts are recovered through
rates.    Participating utilities are also required to file an annual update on their AMI implementation progress. On April 1, 2016, ComEd filed
an annual progress report on its AMI Implementation Plan with the ICC, which allows for the installation of more than four million smart meters throughout ComEd s service territory through 2018. To date, approximately three million smart meters
have been installed in the Chicago area.    Pursuant to EIMA, ComEd annually contributes $4 million for customer education for as long as the AMI
Deployment Plan remains in effect. Additionally, ComEd contributed $10 million annually through 2016 to fund customer assistance programs for  low-income  customers, which are not recoverable through rates.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
   Annual Electric Distribution Filings   
 For each of the following years, the ICC approved the following total increases/(decreases) in ComEd s electric distributions formula rate filings:

(a) 
 On December 20, 2016, the ICC granted ComEd s and other parties  joint application for rehearing on the impact that changing ComEd s OSHA recordable rate for 2014 and 2015 has on the revenue
requirement approved in this order. ComEd has proposed that the 2016 total electric distribution revenue requirement be reduced by $18 million which would be refunded to customers in 2017.    

(b) 
 Includes a reduction of 5 basis points for a reliability performance metric penalty.        Illinois Future Energy Jobs
Act (Exelon, Generation, and ComEd).       Background   
 On December 7, 2016, FEJA was signed into law by the Governor of Illinois. FEJA is effective June 1, 2017, and includes, among other provisions, (1) a
ZES providing compensation for certain nuclear-powered generating facilities, (2) an extension of and certain adjustments to ComEd s electric distribution formula rate, (3) new cumulative persisting annual energy efficiency MWh savings goals
for ComEd, (4) revisions to the Illinois RPS requirements, (5) provisions for adjustments to or termination of FEJA programs if the average impact on ComEd s customer rates exceeds specified limits, (6) revisions to the existing net metering
statute to (i) mandate net metering for community generation projects, and establish billing procedures for subscribers to those projects, (ii) provide immediately for netting at the energy-only rate for nonresidential customers, and (iii)
transition from netting at the full retail rate to the energy-only rate for certain residential net metering customers once the net meter customer load equals 5% of total peak demand supplied in the previous year and (7) support for low income
rooftop and community solar programs.     Zero Emission Standard   
 FEJA includes a ZES that provides compensation through the procurement of ZECs targeted at preserving the environmental attributes of zero-emissions
nuclear-powered generating facilities that meet specific eligibility criteria. ZES will have a 10-year duration extending through May 31, 2027.  
      339

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
Eligible generators may participate in a procurement event overseen by the Illinois Power Agency and selected generators will directly contract with Illinois utilities for the procurement of the
ZECs based upon the number of MWh produced by the eligible facilities, subject to specified annual caps. The ZEC price will be based upon the current social cost of carbon as determined by the federal government and is initially established at
$16.50 per MWh of production, subject to future adjustments based on specified escalation and pricing adjustment mechanisms designed to lower the ZEC price based on increases in underlying energy and capacity prices.  
 Illinois utilities, including ComEd, will be required to purchase from eligible nuclear facilities an amount of ZECs equivalent to 16% of the actual
amount of electricity delivered in 2014. ComEd will recover all costs associated with purchasing ZECs through a new rate rider, which will provide for an annual reconciliation and true-up to actual costs incurred by ComEd to purchase ZECs, with any
difference to be credited to or collected from ComEd s retail customers in subsequent periods.    See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements
for the impacts of the provisions above on Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The provisions do not impact ComEd s Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows until 2017.     ComEd Electric Distribution Rates   
 FEJA extends the sunset date for ComEd s performance-based electric distribution formula rate from 2019 to the end of 2022, allows ComEd to revise
the electric distribution formula rate to eliminate the ROE collar, and allows ComEd to implement a decoupling tariff if the electric distribution formula rate is terminated at any time. ComEd will revise its electric distribution formula rate to
eliminate the ROE collar, which will eliminate any unfavorable or favorable impacts of weather or load from ComEd s electric distribution formula rate revenues beginning with the reconciliation filed in 2018 for the 2017 calendar year. ComEd
will begin reflecting the impacts of this change in its electric distribution services costs regulatory asset or liability beginning in 2017.    FEJA
requires ComEd to make non-recoverable contributions to low income energy assistance programs of $10 million per year for 5 years as long as the electric distribution formula rate remains in effect. With the exception of these contributions, ComEd
will recover from customers, subject to certain caps explained below, the costs it incurs pursuant to FEJA either through its electric distribution formula rate or other recovery mechanisms.  
  Energy Efficiency     Existing Illinois law requires ComEd to
implement cost-effective energy efficiency measures and, for a 10-year period ending May 31, 2018, cost-effective demand response measures to reduce peak demand by 0.1% over the prior year for eligible retail customers.  
 Beginning January 1, 2018, FEJA provides for new cumulative annual energy efficiency MWh savings goals for ComEd, which are designed to achieve 21.5% of
cumulative persisting annual MWh savings by 2030, as compared to the deemed baseline of 88 million MWhs of electric power and energy sales. FEJA, deems the cumulative persisting annual MWh savings to be 6.6% from 2012 through the end of 2017. ComEd
expects to spend approximately $250 million to $400 million annually from 2017 through 2030 to achieve these energy efficiency MWh savings goals. In addition, FEJA extends the peak demand reduction requirement from 2018 to 2026. Because the new
requirements  
      340

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
apply beginning in 2018, FEJA extends the existing energy efficiency plans, which were due to end on May 31, 2017, through December 31, 2017. FEJA also exempts customers with demands over 10 MW
from energy efficiency plans and requirements beginning June 1, 2017.    FEJA allows ComEd to cancel its existing energy efficiency rate rider and
replace it with an energy efficiency formula rate, and to defer energy efficiency costs (except for any voltage optimization costs which will be recovered through the electric distribution formula rate) as a separate regulatory asset that will be
recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life, as approved by the ICC, of the related energy efficiency measures. ComEd will earn a return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset at a rate equal to its
weighted average cost of capital, which is based on a year-end capital structure and calculated using the same methodology applicable to ComEd s electric distribution formula rate. Through December 31, 2030, the return on equity that ComEd
earns on its energy efficiency regulatory asset is subject to a maximum downward or upward adjustment of 200 basis points if ComEd s cumulative persisting annual MWh savings falls short of or exceeds specified percentage benchmarks of its
annual incremental savings goal. ComEd will be required to file an update to its energy efficiency formula rate on or before June 1 each year, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. The annual update will be based on
projected current year energy efficiency costs and the related projected year-end regulatory asset balance less any related deferred taxes. The update will also include a reconciliation of any differences between the revenue requirement in effect
for the prior year and the revenue requirement based on actual prior year costs and year-end energy efficiency regulatory asset balances less any related deferred taxes.  
 ComEd expects to cancel its existing energy efficiency rider, at which time it must perform a reconciliation of revenues and costs incurred through the
cancellation date and issue a one-time credit on retail customers  bills for any over-recoveries. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd s over-recoveries associated with its existing energy efficiency rider of $141 million were reflected in
Current regulatory liabilities on Exelon s and ComEd s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, ComEd expects to provide credits to customers in 2017 to address this over-recovery.  
  Renewable Portfolio Standard     Existing Illinois law requires
ComEd to purchase each year an increasing percentage of renewable energy resources for the customers for which it supplies electricity. This obligation is satisfied through the procurement of renewable energy credits (RECs). FEJA revises the
Illinois RPS to require ComEd to procure RECs for all retail customers by June 2019, regardless of the customers  electricity supplier, and provides support for low-income rooftop and community solar programs, which will be funded by the
existing Renewable Energy Resources Fund and ongoing RPS collections. ComEd will recover all costs associated with purchasing RECs through rate riders, which will provide for a reconciliation and true-up to actual costs, with any difference between
revenues and expenses to be credited to or collected from ComEd s retail customers in subsequent periods. The first reconciliation and true-up for RECs will cover revenues and costs for the four year period beginning June 1, 2017 through May
31, 2021. Subsequently, the RPS rate rider will provide for an annual reconciliation and true-up.     Customer Rate Increase Limitations   
 FEJA includes provisions intended to limit the average impact on ComEd customer rates for recovery of costs incurred under FEJA as follows: (1) for a
typical ComEd residential customer, the average impact must be less than $0.25 cents per month, (2) for nonresidential customers with a peak demand less than 10 MW, the average annual impact must be less than 1.3% of the average amount
 
      341

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
paid per kWh for electric service by Illinois commercial retail customers during 2015, and (3) for nonresidential customers with a peak demand greater than 10 MW, the average annual impact must
be less than 1.3% of the average amount paid per kWh for electric service by Illinois industrial retail customers during 2015.    By June 30, 2017,
ComEd must submit a 10-year projection to the ICC of customer rate impacts for residential customers and nonresidential customers with a peak demand less than 10 MW. Thereafter, beginning in 2018, ComEd must submit a report to the ICC for
residential customers and nonresidential customers with a peak demand less than 10 MW by February 15th and June 30th of each year, respectively. For nonresidential customers with a peak demand greater than 10 MW, ComEd must submit a report to the
ICC by May 1 of each year if a rate reduction will be necessary in the following year. For residential customers, the reports will include the actual costs incurred under FEJA during the preceding year and a rolling 10-year customer rate impact
projection. The reports for nonresidential customers with a peak demand less than 10 MW will also include the actual costs incurred under FEJA during the preceding year, as well as the average annual rate increase from January 1, 2017 through the
end of the preceding year and the average annual rate increase projected for the remainder of the 10-year period.    If the projected residential
customer or nonresidential customer with a peak demand less than 10 MW rate increase exceeds the limitations during the first four years, ComEd is required to decrease costs associated with FEJA investments, including reductions to ZEC contract
quantities. If the projected residential customer or nonresidential customer with a peak demand less than 10 MW rate increase exceeds the limitations during the last six years, ComEd is required to demonstrate how it will reduce FEJA investments to
ensure compliance. If the actual residential customer or nonresidential customer with a peak demand less than 10 MW rate increase exceeds the limitations for any one year, ComEd is required to submit a corrective action plan to decrease future year
costs to reduce customer rates to ensure future compliance. If the actual residential customer or nonresidential customer rate exceeds the limitations for two consecutive years, ComEd can offer to credit customers for amounts billed in excess of the
limitations or ComEd can terminate FEJA investments. If ComEd chooses to terminate FEJA investments, the ICC shall order termination of ZEC contracts and further initiate proceedings to reduce energy efficiency savings goals and terminate support
for low-income rooftop and community solar programs. ComEd is allowed to fully recover all costs incurred as of and up to the date of the programs  termination.  
 For the energy efficiency formula, ComEd will record a regulatory asset or liability and corresponding increase or decrease to Operating revenues for
any differences between the revenue requirement in effect and ComEd s best estimate of the revenue requirement expected to be approved by the ICC for that year s reconciliation. For the other rate riders to be established under FEJA, ComEd
will record a regulatory asset or liability for any differences between revenues and incurred expenses. FEJA did not have any impacts on ComEd s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows in 2016.      Illinois Procurement Proceedings (Exelon, Generation and ComEd).   ComEd is permitted to recover its electricity
procurement costs from retail customers without  mark-up.  Since June 2009, the IPA designs, and the ICC approves, an electricity supply portfolio for ComEd and the IPA administers a competitive process under
which ComEd procures its electricity supply from various suppliers, including Generation. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd has completed all required  ICC-approved  procurements as called for by the IPA
Procurement Plan s timeline.

    Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Resources (Exelon and ComEd).    
 In accordance with legislation in effect on December 31, 2016, the IPA s Procurement Plans include the procurement of cost-effective renewable
energy resources in amounts that equal or exceed a minimum target percentage of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers. The June 1, 2016 target renewable energy resources obligation for the
utilities was at least 11.5%. This obligation increases by at least 1.5% each year thereafter to an ultimate target of at least 25% by June 1, 2025. All goals are subject to rate impact criteria set forth by Illinois legislation. As of
December 31, 2016, ComEd had purchased renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, in accordance with the IPA Procurement Plan. ComEd currently retires all RECs upon transfer and acceptance. ComEd is permitted to recover
procurement costs of RECs from retail customers without  mark-up  through rates.    In accordance with FEJA that
takes effect on June 1, 2017, beginning with the plan or plans to be implemented in the 2017 delivery year, the IPA shall develop a long term renewable resources procurement plan (LT Plan). The RPS target percentages for the overall
service territory have not changed through June 1, 2025 although FEJA extended the 25% RPS target to delivery years after 2025. Currently, each RES and each utility is responsible for the renewable resource obligation of the customers it
supplies power for. Over time, this will change and the utility will procure renewable resources based on the retail load of substantially all customers in its service territory. For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2017, the LT Plan shall
include cost effective renewable energy resources procured by the utility for the retail load the utility supplies and for 50% of the retail customer load supplied by Retail Electric Suppliers in the utility service territory on February 28,
2017. Utility procurement for RES supplied retail customer load will increase to 75% June 1, 2018 and to 100% beginning June 1, 2019.  
   Grand Prairie Gateway Transmission Line (Exelon and ComEd).   On December 2, 2013, ComEd filed a request to obtain the ICC s
approval to construct a  60-mile  overhead 345kV transmission line that traverses Ogle, DeKalb, Kane and DuPage Counties in Northern Illinois. On October 22, 2014, the ICC issued an Order approving
ComEd s request. The City of Elgin and certain other parties each filed an appeal of the ICC Order in the Illinois Appellate Court for the Second District. ComEd then reached a settlement of the appeal filed by all parties except Elgin. On
March 31, 2016, the Illinois Appellate Court issued its opinion affirming the ICC s grant of a certificate to ComEd to construct and operate the line. Elgin did not seek further review of the Illinois Appellate Court decision. On
May 28, 2014, in a separate proceeding, FERC issued an order granting ComEd s request to include 100% of the capital costs recorded to construction work in progress during construction of the line in ComEd s transmission rate base. If
the project is cancelled or abandoned for reasons beyond ComEd s control, FERC approved the ability for ComEd to recover 100% of its prudent costs incurred after May 21, 2014 and 50% of its costs incurred prior to May 21, 2014 in
ComEd s transmission rate base. The costs incurred for the project prior to May 21, 2014 were immaterial. ComEd has acquired the necessary land rights across the project route through voluntary transactions. ComEd began construction of the
line during 2015 with an expected  in-service  date of June 2017.      FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc
(Exelon and ComEd).   During 2013, the ICC approved, and directed ComEd and Ameren (the Utilities) to enter into  20-year  sourcing agreements with FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc (FutureGen), under
which FutureGen will retrofit and repower an existing plant in Morgan County, Illinois to a 166 MW near zero emissions coal-fueled generation plant, with an assumed commercial operation date in 2017. ComEd executed the sourcing agreement with
FutureGen in accordance with the ICC s order. The order also directed ComEd and Ameren to recover these costs from their electric distribution customers through the use of a tariff, regardless of whether they purchase electricity from
ComEd or Ameren, or from competitive electric generation suppliers.

  In February 2015, the DOE suspended funding for the cost development of FutureGen. On January 13,
2016, FutureGen informed the Illinois Supreme Court that it had ceased all development efforts on the FutureGen project. In February 2016, FutureGen terminated its sourcing agreement with ComEd. On May 19, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court
dismissed the matter as moot. As a result, ComEd is under no further obligation under this agreement.     Pennsylvania Regulatory Matters   
   2015 Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and PECO).   On March 27, 2015, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC
requesting an increase of $190 million to its annual service revenues for electric delivery, which requested an ROE of 10.95%. On September 10, 2015, PECO and interested parties filed with the PAPUC a petition for joint settlement for an
increase of $127 million in annual distribution service revenue. No overall ROE was specified in the settlement. On December 17, 2015, the PAPUC approved the settlement of PECO s electric distribution rate case, which included the
approval of the  In-Program  Arrearage Forgiveness ( IPAF ) Program. The approved electric delivery rates became effective on January 1, 2016.  
 The IPAF Program provides for forgiveness of a portion of the eligible arrearage balance of its  low-income 
Customer Assistance Program (CAP) accounts receivable at program inception. The forgiveness will be granted to the extent CAP customers remain current over the duration of the five-year payment agreement term. The Settlement guarantees
PECO s recovery of  two-thirds  of the arrearage balance through a combination of customer payments and rate recovery, including through future rates cases if necessary. The remaining  one-third  of the arrearage balance has been absorbed by PECO through bad debt expense on its Consolidated Statements of Operations. In October 2016, the IPAF was fully implemented. A regulatory asset of
$11 million representing previously incurred bad debt expense associated with the eligible accounts receivable balances was recorded as of December 31, 2016.  
   Pennsylvania Procurement Proceedings (Exelon and PECO).   Through PECO s first two PAPUC approved DSP Programs, PECO procured
electric supply for its default electric customers through PAPUC approved competitive procurements. DSP I and DSP II expired on May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2015, respectively.  
 The second DSP Program included a number of retail market enhancements recommended by the PAPUC in its previously issued Retail Markets Intermediate
Work Plan Order. PECO was also directed to submit a plan to allow its  low-income  CAP customers to purchase their generation supply from EGSs beginning in April 2014. In May 2013, PECO filed its CAP Shopping
Plan with the PAPUC. By an Order entered on January 24, 2014, the PAPUC approved PECO s plan, with modifications, to make CAP shopping available beginning April 15, 2014. On March 20, 2014, the Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA)
and  low-income  advocacy groups filed an appeal and emergency request for a stay with the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, claiming that the PAPUC-ordered CAP Shopping plan does not contain sufficient
protections for  low-income  customers. On July 14, 2015, the Court issued opinions on the OCA and  low-income  advocacy group appeal. Specifically, the Court remanded
the issue to the PAPUC with instructions that it approve a rule revision to the PECO CAP Shopping Plan that would prohibit CAP customers from entering into contracts with an EGS that would impose early cancellation/termination fees. The PAPUC, as
well as the  low-income  advocates and the Office of Consumer Advocate, appealed the Court s decision. On April 5, 2016, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to accept the appeals. On May 11,
2016, the PAPUC issued a Secretarial Letter requiring PECO to propose a rule revision to the PECO CAP Shopping Plan consistent with the Court s decision. On July 19, 2016, PECO filed a letter stating its intent to revise its Plan by
September 1, 2016 to incorporate the rule revision. On September 1, 2016, PECO filed its proposed rule revision that is consistent with the Court s opinion with a proposed effective date of April 14, 2017.

  On December 4, 2014, the PAPUC approved PECO s third DSP Program. The program has a  24-month  term from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2017, and complies with electric generation procurement guidelines set forth in Act 129. Under the program, PECO procured electric supply through four
competitive procurements for fixed price full requirements contracts of two years or less for the residential classes and small and medium commercial classes and spot market price full requirement contracts for the large commercial and industrial
class load. Beginning in June 2016, the medium commercial class  (101-500  kW) moved to spot market pricing. In September 2016, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation,
resulting from the final of its four scheduled procurements. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts with Generation are included in purchased power from affiliates on PECO s Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income.    On March 12, 2015, PECO settled the CAP Design with the Office of Consumer Advocates (OCA) and Low Income Advocates, and
filed the proposed plan with the PAPUC on March 20, 2015. The program design changes the rate structure of PECO s CAP to make the bills more affordable to customers enrolled in the assistance program. The CAP discounts continue to be
recovered through PECO s universal service fund cost. On July 8, 2015, the CAP Design was approved by the PAPUC, and subsequently implemented in October 2016 as planned.  
 On March 17, 2016, PECO filed its fourth DSP Program with the PAPUC proposing a  24-month  term from
June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2019, in compliance with electric generation procurement guidelines set forth in Act 129. On October 4, 2016, the Administrative Law Judge recommended that PECO s previously filed partial
settlement be approved without modification. The settlement would extend the program period through May 2021 and consolidate the Medium Commercial and Large Commercial classes of default service customers into a Consolidated Large Commercial
Class proposed by the Company. The issue of PECO s implementation of CAP Shopping was reserved for briefing, and the Administrative Law Judge determined that issue was not a part of the DSP IV case. On December 8, 2016, the
PAPUC approved the fourth DSP Program for a  48-month  term and deferred CAP Shopping to another proceeding. OCA and Low Income Advocates subsequently filed a Petition for Reconsideration and Clarification,
which is pending before the PAPUC.      Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments (Exelon and PECO).   In April 2010, pursuant to Act 129 and
the  follow-on  Implementation Order of 2009, the PAPUC approved PECO s Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan (SMPIP), under which PECO will install more than 1.6 million electric smart meters
and an AMI communication network by 2020. As approved by the PAPUC, PECO accelerated its installation and deployed substantially all smart meters by December 31, 2015, for a total of 1.7 million smart meters. PECO spent $578 million
and $155 million on smart meter and smart grid infrastructure, respectively, of which $200 million has been funded by SGIG. Recovery of smart meter costs are reflected in base rates effective January 1, 2016.  
   Energy Efficiency Programs (Exelon and PECO).   The PAPUC issued its Phase II EE C implementation order on August 2, 2012,
that provided energy consumption reduction requirements for the second phase of Act 129 s EE C program, which went into effect on June 1, 2013. Pursuant to the Phase II implementation order, PECO filed its three-year EE C Phase II
Plan with the PAPUC on November 1, 2012. The plan set forth how PECO would reduce electric consumption by at least 1,125,852 MWh in its service territory for the period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016, adjusted for weather and
extraordinary loads. The implementation order permitted PECO to apply any excess savings achieved during Phase I against its Phase II consumption reduction targets, with no reduction to its Phase II budget. In accordance with the Act 129 Phase II
implementation order, at least 10% and 4.5% of the total consumption reductions had to be through programs directed toward PECO s public

and low income sectors, respectively. Act 129 mandates that the total cost of the plan may not exceed 2% of the electric company s total annual revenue as of December 31, 2006.  
 On March 15, 2013 and February 28, 2014, PECO filed Petitions for Approval to amend its EE C Phase II Plan to continue its DLC demand
reduction program for mass market customers through May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2016, respectively. PECO proposed to fund the estimated $10 million annual costs of the plan by modifying incentive levels for other Phase II programs. The
costs of the DLC program were recovered through PECO s Energy Efficiency Plan surcharge along with other Phase II Plan costs. The PAPUC granted PECO s Petitions on May 5, 2013 and April 23, 2014, respectively. On November 15
2016, PECO reported to the PAPUC that as of the conclusion of the EE C Phase II Plan, all plan requirements have been met. A final Phase II compliance determination is expected to be issued in the first half of 2017.  
 On June 19, 2015, the PAPUC issued its Phase III EE C implementation order that provides energy consumption reduction requirements for the
third phase of Act 129 s EE C program with a five-year term from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021.    Pursuant to the Phase III
implementation order, PECO filed its five-year EE C Phase III Plan with the PAPUC on November 30, 2015. The Plan sets forth how PECO will reduce electric consumption by at least 1,962,659 MWh, with a goal of 2,100,875 MWh in its service
territory for the period June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021. The PAPUC approved PECO s EE C Phase III Plan, with requested clarifications, on May 19, 2016.  
   Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (Exelon and PECO).   In November 2004, Pennsylvania adopted the AEPS Act. The AEPS Act mandated
that beginning in 2011, following the expiration of PECO s rate cap transition period, certain percentages of electric energy sold to Pennsylvania retail electric customers shall be generated from certain alternative energy resources as
measured in AECs. The requirement for electric energy that must come from Tier I alternative energy resources ranges from approximately 3.5% to 8%, and the requirement for Tier II alternative energy resources ranges from 6.2% to 10%. The required
compliance percentages incrementally increase each annual compliance period, which is from June 1 through May 31, until May 31, 2021. These Tier I and Tier II alternative energy resources include acceptable energy sources as set forth
in Act 129 and the AEPS Act.    PECO continues to procure alternative energy credits through full requirements contracts and its existing long-term
solar contracts to meet the annual AEPS compliance requirements. All AEPS compliance costs are being recovered on a full and current basis from default service customers through the GSA.  
   Pennsylvania Retail Electricity and Gas Markets (Exelon and PECO).   Beginning in 2011, the PAPUC issued an order outlining the next steps
in its investigation into the status of competition in Pennsylvania s retail electricity market. The PAPUC found that the existing default service model presents substantial impediments to the development of a vibrant retail market in
Pennsylvania and directed its Office of Competitive Markets Oversight to evaluate potential intermediate and long-term structural changes to the default service model. Through various orders, the PAPUC issued default electric service pricing for
customers in PECO s service territory. See Pennsylvania procurement proceedings discussed above for additional details.    In early 2014, the
extreme weather in PECO s service territory resulted in increased electricity commodity costs causing certain shopping customers to receive unexpectedly high utility bills. In response to a significant number of customer complaints throughout
Pennsylvania, on April 3, 2014,

the PAPUC unanimously voted to adopt two rulemaking orders to address the issue. The first rulemaking order requires electric generation suppliers to provide more consumer education regarding
their contract. The second rulemaking order requires electric distribution companies to enable customers to switch suppliers within three business days (known as accelerated switching). The improved customer education and accelerated switching were
to be in place within 30 days and six months of approval of the orders, respectively. The orders became final on June 14, 2014. On December 4, 2014, the PAPUC approved PECO s implementation plan (known as Bill on Supplier Switch),
allowing PECO to implement accelerated switching by the December 15, 2014 deadline.    On September 12, 2013, the PAPUC issued an Order that
initiated an investigation into Pennsylvania s natural gas retail market, including the role of the existing default service model and opportunities for market enhancements. On December 18, 2014, the PAPUC issued a Final Order directing
the Office of Competitive Market Oversight (OCMO) to continue its investigation, confirming that natural gas distribution companies should remain with the default service model for the time being and directing establishment of a working group to
examine other competitive issues. The OCMO has established a working group to review operation of the natural gas retail market and to consider potential recommendations on competitive issues.  
   Pennsylvania Act 11 of 2012 (Exelon and PECO).   In February 2012, Act 11 was signed into law, which provided the PAPUC authority to approve
the implementation of a distribution system improvement charge (DSIC) in rates designed to recover capital project costs incurred to repair, improve or replace utilities  aging electric and natural gas distribution systems in Pennsylvania.
Prior to recovering costs pursuant to a DSIC, the PAPUC s implementation order requires a utility to have a Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP) approved by the Commission, which outlines how the utility is planning to increase its
investment for repairing, improving or replacing aging infrastructure.    On May 7, 2015, the PAPUC approved PECO s modified natural gas
LTIIP. In accordance with the approved LTIIP, PECO plans to spend $534 million through 2022 to further accelerate the replacement of existing gas mains and to relocate meters from indoors to outside in accordance with recent PAPUC rulemaking.
In addition, on March 20, 2015, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC for approval of its gas DSIC mechanism for recovery of gas LTIIP expenditures. On September 11, 2015, the PAPUC entered its Opinion and Order approving PECO s
petition for a gas DSIC.    On March 27, 2015, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC for approval of its proposed electric DSIC and LTIIP. In
accordance with the LTIIP (System 2020 plan), PECO plans to spend $275 million over the next five years to modernize and storm-harden its electric distribution system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to damage. The DSIC
will allow PECO the opportunity to recover the costs, subject to certain criteria, incurred to repair, improve or replace its electric distribution property between rate cases. On October 22, 2015, the PAPUC entered its Opinion and Order
approving PECO s proposed petition for its electric LTIIP and DSIC.     Maryland Regulatory Matters   
   2016 Maryland Electric Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and Pepco).   On November 15, 2016, the MDPSC approved an increase in
electric distribution base rates of $53 million based on a ROE of 9.55%. The new rates became effective for services rendered on or after November 15, 2016. MDPSC also approved Pepco s recovery of substantially all of its capital
investment and regulatory assets associated with its AMI program as part of the newly effective rates as well as a recovery over a five-year period of transition costs related to a new billing system implemented in 2015. As a result,

during the fourth quarter of 2016, Exelon, PHI and Pepco established a regulatory asset of $13 million,  wrote-off  $3 million in disallowed AMI
costs and recorded a  pre-tax  credit to net income for $10 million. Additionally, the MDPSC denied Pepco s request to extend its Grid Resiliency Program surcharge for new system reliability and safety
improvement projects, with costs for such programs to be recovered going forward through base rates.      2016 Maryland Electric Distribution Base
Rates (Exelon, PHI and DPL).   On July 20, 2016, DPL filed an application with the MDPSC requesting an increase of $66 million to its electric distribution base rates, which was later updated to $57 million, based on a requested
ROE of 10.6%. The application is inclusive of a request seeking recovery of DPL s regulatory assets associated with its AMI program over a five year period, which was later modified to 10 years, supported by evidence demonstrating that the
benefits of the AMI program exceed the costs on a present value basis. Any adjustments to rates approved by the MDPSC are expected to take effect in February 2017. DPL cannot predict how much of the requested increase the MDPSC will approve. In
addition to the proposed rate increase, DPL is proposing to continue its Grid Resiliency Program initially approved in September 2013 in connection with DPL s electric distribution rate case filed in February 2013. Under the Grid Resiliency
Program, DPL is authorized to receive recovery of specific investments as the assets are placed in service through the Grid Resiliency Charge. In connection with the Grid Resiliency Program, DPL proposes to accelerate improvement to priority feeders
and install single-phase reclosing fuse technology by investing $4.6 million a year for two years for a total of $9.2 million. DPL cannot predict whether the MDPSC will approve a continuation of DPL s Grid Resiliency Program proposal.
     2015 Maryland Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Base Rates (Exelon and BGE).   On November 6, 2015, and as amended through the
course of the proceeding, BGE filed for electric and natural gas base rate increases with the MDPSC, ultimately requesting annual increases of $116 million and $78 million, respectively, of which $104 million and $37 million were
related to recovery of electric and natural gas smart grid initiative costs, respectively. BGE also proposed to recover an annual increase of approximately $30 million for Baltimore City underground conduit fees through a surcharge.  
 On June 3, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order in which the MDPSC found compelling evidence to conclude that BGE s smart grid initiative overall
was cost beneficial to customers. However, the June 3 order contained several cost disallowances and adjustments, including not allowing BGE to defer or recover through a surcharge the $30 million increase in annual Baltimore City
underground conduit fees. On June 30, 2016, BGE filed a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order requesting that the MDPSC modify its order to reverse certain decisions including the decision associated with the Baltimore City
underground conduit fees. OPC also subsequently filed for a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order.    On July 29, 2016, the MDPSC
issued an order on the petitions for rehearing that reversed certain of its prior cost disallowances and adjustments related to the smart grid initiative. Through the combination of the orders, the MDPSC authorized electric and natural gas rate
increases of $44 million and $48 million, respectively, and an allowed ROE for the electric and natural gas distribution businesses of 9.75% and 9.65%, respectively. The new electric and natural gas base rates took effect for service
rendered on or after June 4, 2016. However, MDPSC s July 29 order on the petition on rehearing still did not allow BGE to defer or recover through a surcharge the increase in Baltimore City underground conduit fees.  
 On August 26, 2016, BGE filed an appeal of the MDPSC s orders with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On August 29, 2016, the
residential consumer advocate also filed an appeal of the

MDPSC s order but with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On November 15, 2016, Baltimore County Circuit Court issued an order deciding that the cases should be consolidated and
should proceed in Baltimore County Circuit Court. However, on January 9, 2017, BGE filed to withdraw its appeal of the MDPSC s orders and on January 10, 2017, the residential consumer advocate filed to withdraw its appeal as well.
Refer to the Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investment disclosure below for further details on the impact of the ultimate disallowances contained in the orders to BGE.  
   Cash Working Capital Order (Exelon and BGE).   On November 17, 2016, the MDPSC rendered a decision in the proceeding to review
BGE s request to recover its cash working capital (CWC) requirement for its Provider of Last Resort service, also known as Standard Offer Service (SOS), as well as other components that make up the Administrative Charge, the mechanism that
enables BGE to recover all of its  SOS-related  costs. The Administrative Charge is now comprised of five components: CWC, uncollectibles, incremental costs, return, and an administrative adjustment, which is an
adder to the utility s SOS rate to act as a proxy for retail suppliers  costs. The Commission accepted BGE positions on recovery of CWC and pass-through recovery of BGE s actual uncollectibles and incremental costs. The order also
grants BGE a modest return on the SOS. The Commission ruled that the level of the administrative adjustment will be determined in BGE s next rate case. On December 16, 2016, MDPSC Staff requested clarification concerning the amount of
return on the SOS awarded to BGE and on December 19, 2016, the residential consumer advocate sought rehearing of the return awarded. On January 24, 2017, the MDPSC issued an order denying the MDPSC Staff request for clarification and the
residential consumer advocate request for rehearing.      2014 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Base Rates (Exelon and BGE).   On
July 2, 2014, and as amended on September 15, 2014, BGE filed for electric and gas base increases with the MDPSC, ultimately requesting increases of $99 million and $68 million, respectively.  
 On October 17, 2014, BGE filed with the MDPSC a unanimous settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement) reached with all parties to the case
under which it would receive an increase of $22 million in electric base rates and an increase of $38 million in gas base rates. The Settlement Agreement establishes new depreciation rates which have the effect of decreasing annual
depreciation expense by approximately $20 million, primarily for electric. On December 4, 2014, the Public Utility Law Judge issued a proposed order approving the Settlement Agreement without modification, which became a final order on
December 12, 2014. The approved distribution rate order authorizing BGE to increase electric and gas distribution rates became effective for services rendered on or after December 15, 2014.  
   Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments (Exelon and BGE).   In August 2010, the MDPSC approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for BGE
that included the planned installation of 2 million residential and commercial electric and natural gas smart meters at an expected total cost of $480 million of which $200 million was funded by SGIG. The MDPSC s approval ordered
BGE to defer the associated incremental costs, depreciation and amortization, and an appropriate return, in a regulatory asset until such time as a cost-effective advanced metering system is implemented. Refer to AMI programs in the Regulatory
Assets and Liabilities section below for further details.    As part of the 2015 electric and natural gas distribution rate case filed on
November 6, 2015, BGE sought recovery of its smart grid initiative costs, supported by evidence demonstrating that BGE had, in fact, implemented a cost-beneficial advanced metering system. On June 3, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order
concluding that the smart grid initiative overall is cost beneficial to its customers. However, the June 3 order contained several cost disallowances and adjustments including disallowances of certain program and meter installation costs and
denial of recovery of any return on unrecovered costs for

 non-AMI  meters replaced under the program. On June 30, 2016, BGE filed a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order requesting that the MDPSC
modify its order to reverse certain decisions and change certain of the cost disallowances and adjustments to enable BGE to defer those costs for recovery through future electric and natural gas rates. The residential consumer advocate also
subsequently filed for a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order. On July 29, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order on the petitions for rehearing that reversed certain of its prior cost disallowances and adjustments related to the smart grid
initiative. On August 26, 2016, BGE filed an appeal of the MDPSC s orders with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On August 29, 2016, the residential consumer advocate also filed an appeal of the MDPSC s order but with the
Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On November 15, 2016, Baltimore County Circuit Court issued an order deciding that the cases should be consolidated and should proceed in Baltimore County Circuit Court. However, on January 9, 2017, BGE
filed to withdraw its appeal of the MDPSC s orders and on January 10, 2017, the residential consumer advocate filed to withdraw its appeal as well.  
 As a combined result of the MDPSC orders, BGE recorded a $52 million charge to Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and BGE s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income reducing certain regulatory assets and other long-lived assets. Pursuant to the combined MDPSC orders, BGE also reclassified $54 million of
 non-AMI  plant costs from Property, plant and equipment, net to Regulatory assets on Exelon s and BGE s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016.  
   2013 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Base Rates (Exelon and BGE).   On May 17, 2013, and as amended on August 23, 2013, BGE
filed for electric and natural gas base increases with the MDPSC. In addition to these requested rate increases, BGE s application also included a request for recovery of incremental capital expenditures and operating costs associated with
BGE s proposed short-term reliability improvement plan (the ERI initiative) in response to a MDPSC order through a surcharge separate from base rates.  
 On December 13, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order authorizing BGE to recover through a surcharge mechanism costs associated with five ERI initiative
programs designed to accelerate electric reliability improvements premised upon the condition that the MDPSC approve specific projects in advance of cost recovery. As of December 31, 2016, BGE has received approval of its updated surcharge
filings three times for rates to be effective in 2014, 2015 and 2016.    In January 2014, the residential consumer advocate in Maryland filed an
appeal to the order issued by the MDPSC on December 13, 2013 in BGE s 2013 electric and natural gas distribution rate cases. The residential consumer advocate filed its related legal memorandum on August 22, 2014, challenging the
MDPSC s approval of the ERI initiative surcharge. BGE submitted a response to the appeal on October 15, 2014, and a hearing was held on November 17, 2014. On October 26, 2015, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued an order
affirming the MDPSC decision. However, on November 30, 2015, the residential consumer advocate filed an appeal of the Circuit Court s decision with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. On March 7, 2016, the consumer advocate
withdrew its appeal and no further action is expected.      MDPSC New Generation Contract Requirement (Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI, Pepco and
DPL).   On April 12, 2012, the MDPSC issued an order that requires BGE, Pepco and DPL (collectively, the Contract EDCs) to negotiate and enter into a contract with the winning bidder of a competitive bidding process to build one new power
plant in the range of 650 to 700 MWs beginning in 2015, in amounts proportional to their relative SOS loads. Under the terms of the order, the winning bidder was to construct a 661 MW natural  gas-fired 
combined cycle generation plant in Waldorf, Maryland, with an

expected commercial operation date of June 1, 2015, and each of the Contract EDCs was to recover its costs associated with the contract through surcharges on its respective SOS customers.
   In response to a complaint filed by a group of generating companies in the PJM region, on September 30, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the
District of Maryland issued a ruling that the MDPSC s April 2012 order violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by attempting to regulate wholesale prices. In contrast, on October 1, 2013, in response to appeals filed by the
Contract EDCs and other parties, the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City upheld the MDPSC s orders requiring the Contract EDCs to enter into the contracts.  
 On October 24, 2013, the Federal district court issued an order ruling that the contracts are illegal and unenforceable. In November 2013 both the
winning bidder and the MDPSC appealed the Federal district court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed the lower Federal court ruling. On November 26, 2014, both the winning bidder and the MDPSC petitioned
the U.S. Supreme Court to consider hearing an appeal of the Fourth Circuit decision. On October 19, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the decision. On April 19, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Fourth
Circuit s ruling upholding the Federal district court s decision.    The decision of the Maryland Circuit Court was appealed to the Maryland
Court of Special Appeals and was stayed pending decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 1, 2016, the Contract EDCs submitted a filing requesting that the MDPSC take notice of the U.S. Supreme Court s decision, and notifying the MDPSC
that the Contract EDCs will dismiss their appeal pending at the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. On September 14, 2016, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals dismissed the pending appeal and the matter is considered closed.  
   MDPSC Derecho Storm Order (Exelon and BGE).   Following the June 2012 Derecho storm which hit the
 mid-Atlantic  region interrupting electrical service to a significant portion of the State of Maryland, the MDPSC issued an order on February 27, 2013 requiring BGE and other Maryland utilities to
file several comprehensive reports with short-term and long-term plans to improve reliability and grid resiliency that were due at various times before August 30, 2013.  
 On September 3, 2013, BGE filed a comprehensive long term assessment examining potential alternatives for improving the resiliency of the electric
grid and a staffing analysis reviewing historical staffing levels as well as forecasting staffing levels necessary under various storm scenarios. During the summer of 2014, an evaluation of the reports filed by BGE and other Maryland utilities was
undertaken by consultants on behalf of the MDPSC and MDPSC Staff. The MDPSC Staff also proposed standards for reliability during major events and estimated times of restoration as well as undertaking an evaluation of performance-based ratemaking
principles and methodologies that would more directly and transparently align reliable service with the utilities  distribution rates and that reduce returns or otherwise penalize  sub-standard 
performance. The MDPSC held hearings in September 2014. BGE currently cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, which may result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs.  
   The Maryland Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Program (Exelon and BGE).   In 2013, legislation intended to accelerate
gas infrastructure replacements in Maryland was signed into law. The law established a mechanism, separate from base rate proceedings, for gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and prudent costs of eligible infrastructure replacement projects
incurred after June 1, 2013. The monthly surcharge and infrastructure replacement costs must be approved by the MDPSC and are subject to a cap and require an annual  true-up  of the surcharge revenues
against actual expenditures. Investment levels in excess of the cap would be recoverable in  
      351

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
a subsequent gas base rate proceeding at which time all costs for the infrastructure replacement projects would be rolled into gas distribution rates. Irrespective of the cap, BGE is required to
file a gas rate case every five years under this legislation.    On August 2, 2013, BGE filed its infrastructure replacement plan and associated
surcharge. On January 29, 2014, the MDPSC issued a decision conditionally approving the first five years of BGE s plan and surcharge. On July 1, 2016, BGE filed an amendment to its infrastructure replacement plan, which the MDPSC
conditionally approved in an order dated November 23, 2016. The revised surcharge reflecting the costs of the amendment became effective January 1, 2017. On December 2, 2016, BGE filed a surcharge update to be effective
February 1, 2017, including a  true-up  of cost estimates included in the 2016 surcharge, along with its 2017 project list and projected capital estimates of $131 million to be included in the 2017
surcharge calculation. The MDPSC subsequently approved BGE s 2017 project list and the proposed surcharge for 2017, which included the 2016 surcharge  true-up.  As of December 31, 2016, BGE recorded a
regulatory liability of $2 million, representing the difference between the surcharge revenues and program costs.    In 2014, the residential
consumer advocate in Maryland appealed MDPSC s decision on BGE s infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge with the Baltimore City Circuit Court, who affirmed the MDPSC s decision. On October 10, 2014, the
residential consumer advocate noticed its appeal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals from the judgment entered by the Baltimore City Circuit Court. During the third quarter of 2015, the residential consumer advocate, MDPSC and BGE filed briefs.
Oral argument in this matter was held before the Court of Special Appeals on November 3, 2015. On January 28, 2016, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued a decision affirming the MDPSC s decision. As the residential consumer
advocate did not appeal the decision of the Court of Special Appeals, the matter is now closed.     Delaware Regulatory Matters   
   Gas Cost Rates. (Exelon, PHI and DPL)   DPL makes an annual GCR filing with the DPSC for the purpose of allowing DPL to recover natural gas
procurement costs through customer rates. In August 2016, DPL made its 2016-2017 GCR filing. The rates proposed in the 2016-2017 GCR filing would result in a GCR increase of approximately 14%. On September 20, 2016, the DPSC issued an order
allowing DPL to place the new rates into effect on November 1, 2016, subject to refund and pending final DPSC approval.      2016 Delaware
Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and DPL).   On May 17, 2016, DPL filed an application with the DPSC to increase its annual electric and natural gas distribution base rates by $63 million and
$22 million, respectively, based on a requested ROE of 10.6%. While the DPSC is not required to issue a decision on the application within a specified period of time, Delaware law allowed DPL to put into effect $2.5 million of each of the
rate increases two months after filing the applications which were effective July 16, 2016. On December 1, 2016, the DPSC approved that an additional $30 million in electric distribution base rates be implemented effective
December 17, 2016, subject to refund based on the final DPSC order, and an additional $10 million in gas base rates be implemented effective December 17, 2016, subject to refund based on the final DPSC order.  
   2013 Delaware Electric Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and DPL).   In March 2013, and as amended on September 20, 2013, DPL filed
for an electric distribution base rate increase with the DPSC, ultimately requesting an annual increase of $39 million.    In August 2014, the
DPSC issued a final order in DPL s 2013 electric distribution rate case for an annual increase of $15 million and an ROE of 9.7%. Rates became effective on May 1, 2014.

  In September 2014, DPL filed an appeal with the Delaware Superior Court of the DPSC s August 2014
order in this proceeding, seeking the court s review of the DPSC s decision relating to the recovery of costs associated with one component of employee compensation, certain retirement benefits and credit facility expenses. The Division of
the Public Advocate filed a cross-appeal in September 2014, pertaining to the treatment of a prepaid pension expense and other postretirement benefit obligations in base rates. Under the Settlement Agreement related to the Merger, the parties agreed
to suspend the appeal and, upon consummation of the Merger, to the withdrawal of the appeal and the cross-appeal with prejudice. In accordance with the settlement, on April 13, 2016, the parties filed a Stipulation of Dismissal with the court
to dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal, at which time the matter was closed.     District of Columbia Regulatory Matters   
   2016 District of Columbia Electric Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and Pepco).   On June 30, 2016, Pepco filed an application with
the DCPSC to increase its annual electric distribution base rates by $86 million, which was updated to $82 million on October 14, 2016, and further updated to approximately $77 million on February 1, 2017, based on a
requested ROE of 10.6%. The DCPSC has issued a procedural schedule indicating a final decision will be issued by July 25, 2017. Any adjustments to its rates approved by the DCPSC are expected to take effect soon thereafter. Pepco cannot predict
how much of the requested increase the DCPSC will approve.    On April 18, 2016, a party to a separate DCPSC proceeding filed a motion to suspend
Pepco s bill stabilization adjustment (BSA), which decouples distribution revenues from utility customers from the amount of electricity delivered. On September 9, 2016, the DCPSC denied the party s motion and determined that the
appropriate forum in which to determine whether the BSA continues to be just and reasonable is in Pepco s rate case proceeding. In addition, the DCPSC stated that it was putting Pepco on notice that all funds collected for the BSA from January
2015 to the issuance of a decision in the rate case proceeding are subject to refund should the DCPSC determine that such funds were not justly or reasonably collected. On November 22, 2016, following Pepco s October 7, 2016 request
for reconsideration of the order, the DCPSC issued an order stating that its September 9, 2016 order was not final and confirming that issues related to the BSA, including potential remedial actions, would be addressed in Pepco s rate
case. Pepco cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the impact of a refund if ordered by the DCPSC.      District of Columbia Power Line
Undergrounding Initiative (Exelon, PHI and Pepco).   In May 2014, the Council of the District of Columbia enacted the Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Financing Act of 2014 (the Improvement Financing Act), which provided enabling
legislation for the District of Columbia Power Line Undergrounding (DC PLUG) initiative which would selectively place underground some of the District of Columbia s most outage-prone power lines.  
 The Improvement Financing Act provides that: (i) Pepco is to fund approximately $500 million of the estimated cost to complete the DC PLUG
initiative, recovering those costs through a volumetric surcharge on the electric bills of Pepco District of Columbia customers; (ii) $375 million of the DC PLUG initiative cost is to be financed by the District of Columbia s issuance
of securitized bonds, which bonds will be repaid through a volumetric surcharge (the DDOT surcharge) on the electric bills of Pepco District of Columbia customers that Pepco will remit to the District of Columbia; and (iii) the remaining costs
up to $125 million are to be covered by the existing capital projects program of the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT). Pepco will not earn a return on or a return of the cost of the assets funded with the proceeds of the
securitized bonds or assets that are constructed by DDOT under its capital projects program, but ownership and responsibility for the operation and maintenance of such assets will be transferred to Pepco for a nominal amount.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  In June 2014, Pepco and DDOT filed a Triennial Plan related to the construction of selected underground
feeders in the District of Columbia. In August 2014, Pepco filed an application for the issuance of a financing order to provide for the issuance of the District s bonds. In March 2016, the DCPSC s orders approving the Triennial Plan and
the application for financing were upheld upon the resolution of appeals that had been filed with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. In compliance with the Improvement Financing Act, on September 30, 2016, Pepco and DDOT filed a Second
Triennial Plan. Recognizing the delays to the First Triennial Plan, Pepco and DDOT requested that the DCPSC hold the Second Triennial Plan in abeyance, and the DCPSC granted this request by order dated October 27, 2016.  
 In June 2015, an agency of the federal government served by Pepco asserted that the DDOT surcharge constitutes a tax on end users from which the federal
government is immune. PHI is currently evaluating the assertion and the resolution of this matter will likely further delay implementation of the DC PLUG initiative.  
  New Jersey Regulatory Matters       2016 New Jersey Electric
Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and ACE).   On August 24, 2016, the NJBPU issued an order approving a stipulation of settlement among ACE, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, NJBPU Staff and Unimin Corporation, and an increase
of $45 million (before New Jersey sales and use tax) to its electric distribution base rates, with the new rates effective immediately. The stipulation of settlement provided that a determination on PowerAhead would be separated into a phase II
of the rate proceeding and decided at a later date and the parties would seek to resolve the matter by the end of 2016, although resolution will most likely occur in the first quarter of 2017. PowerAhead includes capital investments to advance
modernization of the electric grid through energy efficiency, increased distributed generation, and resiliency, focused on improving the distribution system s ability to withstand major storm events. ACE cannot predict if the NJBPU will approve
the PowerAhead initiative.      Update and Reconciliation of Certain Under-Recovered Balances (Exelon, PHI and ACE).    O n
February 1, 2016, ACE submitted its 2016 annual petition with the NJBPU seeking to reconcile and update (i) charges related to the recovery of above-market costs associated with ACE s long-term power purchase contracts with the  non-utility  generators and (ii) costs related to surcharges for the New Jersey Societal Benefit Program (a statewide public interest program that is intended to benefit low income customers and address other
public policy goals) and ACE s uncollectible accounts.    As filed, the net impact of adjusting the charges as proposed would have been an
overall annual rate increase of $9 million (revised to $19 million in April 2016, based upon an update for actuals through March 2016), including New Jersey sales and use tax.  
 On November 30, 2016, the NJBPU approved a stipulation of settlement entered into by the parties providing for an overall annual rate increase of
$1 million effective January 1, 2017. This settlement included a credit of approximately $10 million to the  Non-Utility  Generation charge deferral balance and a credit of approximately
$7 million to the Uncollectible deferral balance. These credits were directed to be applied to the deferral balances in an NJBPU order dated October 31, 2016. That order approved the Joint Recommendation for Settlement of the Most Favored
Nation Provision, which was a condition of the merger between Exelon Corporation and Pepco Holdings, Inc. This rate increase will have no effect on ACE s operating income, since these revenues provide for recovery of deferred costs under an
approved deferral mechanism.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  On February 1, 2017, ACE submitted its 2017 annual petition with the NJBPU seeking to reconcile
and update the same categories of charges and costs as set forth in its 2016 annual petition discussed above. The net impact of adjusting the charges as proposed is an overall annual rate decrease of approximately $29 million, including New
Jersey Sales and Use Tax. The matter is pending at the NJBPU and will be updated for January through March 2017 actual data. ACE has requested that the NJBPU place the new rates into effect by June 1, 2017. There is no assurance that NJBPU will
put final rates in effect by the requested date.      New York Regulatory Matters    
   New York Clean Energy Standard (Exelon, Generation).   On August 1, 2016, the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) issued an order
establishing the CES, a component of a Tier 3 ZEC program targeted at preserving the environmental attributes of  zero-emissions  nuclear-powered generating facilities that meet the criteria demonstrating public
necessity as determined by the NYPSC. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) will centrally procure the ZECs from eligible plants through a  12-year  contract, to be
administered in six  two-year  tranches, extending from April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2029. ZEC payments will be made to the eligible resources based upon the number of MWh produced, subject to
specified caps and minimum performance requirements. The price to be paid for the ZECs under each tranche will be administratively determined using a formula based on the social cost of carbon as determined in 2016 by the federal government,
subject to pricing adjustments designed to lower the ZEC price based on increase in underlying energy and capacity prices. The ZEC price for the first tranche has been set at $17.48 per MWh of production. Following the first tranche, the price
will be updated  bi-annually. Each  Load Serving Entity (LSE) shall be required to purchase an amount of ZECs equivalent to its load ratio share of the total electric energy in the New York Control
Area. Cost recovery from ratepayers shall be incorporated into the commodity charges on customer bills.    The NYPSC initially identified the
three plants eligible for the ZEC program to include, for now, the FitzPatrick, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point nuclear facilities. As issued, the order also provided that the duration of the program beyond the first tranche was conditional upon a
buyer purchasing the FitzPatrick facility and taking title prior to September 1, 2018. On November 18, 2016, the required contracts with NYSERDA were executed for Ginna and Nine Mile Point, in addition to Entergy s execution of the
required contract for the FitzPatrick facility.    Several parties filed with the NYPSC requests for rehearing or reconsideration of the CES.
Generation and CENG also filed a request for clarification, or in the alternative limited rehearing, that the condition limiting the duration of the program beyond the first tranche be limited to the eligibility of the FitzPatrick plant only and
have no bearing on Ginna or Nine Mile Point s eligibility for the full  12-year  duration. On December 15, 2016, the NYPSC approved Exelon s petition to clarify this condition and denied all
petitions for rehearing of the CES. Parties have until  mid-April  to appeal to New York State court the denials of the requests for rehearing. In addition, one Petition seeking to invalidate the ZEC program was
filed in New York State court on November 30, 2016, and amended on January 13, 2017, arguing that the NYPSC violated certain technical provisions of the State Administrative Procedures Act (SAPA) when adopting the ZEC program.  
 On October 19, 2016, a coalition of fossil generation companies filed a complaint in federal district court against the NYPSC alleging that the ZEC
program violates certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution; specifically that the ZEC program interferes with FERC s jurisdiction over wholesale rates

and that it discriminates against out of state competitors. On December 9, 2016, Generation and CENG filed a motion to intervene in the case and to dismiss the lawsuit. The motion to
intervene has been granted and the motion to dismiss is pending.    Other legal challenges remain possible, the outcomes of which remain
uncertain. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements for additional information relative to Ginna and Nine Mile Point, and Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information on Generation s proposed acquisition
of FitzPatrick.      Ginna Nuclear Power Plant Reliability Support Services Agreement (Exelon and Generation).   In November 2014, in
response to a petition filed by Ginna Nuclear Power Plant (Ginna) regarding the possible retirement of Ginna, the NYPSC directed Ginna and Rochester Gas   Electric Company (RG E) to negotiate a Reliability Support Services Agreement
(RSSA) to support the continued operation of Ginna to maintain the reliability of the RG E transmission grid for a specified period of time. During 2015 and 2016, Ginna and RG E made filings with the NYPSC and FERC for their approval of the
proposed RSSA. Although the RSSA was still subject to regulatory approvals, on April 1, 2015, Ginna began delivering the power and capacity from the Ginna plant into the  ISO-NY  consistent with the
technical provisions of the RSSA.    On March 22, 2016, Ginna submitted a compliance filing with FERC with revisions to the RSSA requested by
FERC. On April 8, 2016, FERC accepted the compliance filing and on April 20, 2016, the NYPSC accepted the revised RSSA. Because all regulatory approvals for the RSSA have now been received, Generation began recognizing revenue based on the
final approved pricing contained in the RSSA. Generation also recognized a  one-time  revenue adjustment in April 2016 of approximately $101 million representing the net cumulative previously unrecognized
amount of revenue retroactive from the April 1, 2015 effective date through March 31, 2016. A 49.99% portion of the  one-time  adjustment will be removed from Generation s results of operations as
a result of the noncontrolling interests in CENG.    The RSSA approved by the regulatory authorities has a term expiring on March 31, 2017,
subject to possible extension in the event that RG E needs additional time to complete transmission upgrades to address reliability concerns. In March 2016, RG E notified Ginna that RG E expects to complete the transmission upgrades
prior to the RSSA expiration in March 2017 and will not need Ginna as an ongoing reliability solution after that date.    The approved RSSA requires
Ginna to continue operating through the RSSA term. If Ginna did not plan to retire shortly after the expiration of the RSSA, Ginna was required to file a notice to that effect with the NYPSC no later than September 30, 2016. Under the
terms of the RSSA, if Ginna continues to operate after June 14, 2017, Ginna would be required to make certain refund payments up to a maximum of $20 million to RG E related to capital expenditures. On September 30, 2016, Ginna
filed the required notice with the NYPSC of its intent to continue operating beyond the March 31, 2017 expiry of the RSSA, conditioned upon successful execution of an agreement between Ginna and NYSERDA for the sale of ZECs under the CES. As
stated previously, on November 18, 2016 the required contract with NYSERDA was executed by Generation and CENG for Ginna. Subject to prevailing over any administrative or legal challenges, it is expected the CES will allow Ginna to continue to
operate through the end of its current operating license in 2029. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements for additional discussion of Ginna.

   Transmission Formula Rate (Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).   ComEd s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and
ACE s transmission rates are each established based on a FERC-approved formula. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are required to file an annual update to the FERC-approved formula on or before May 15, with the resulting rates effective on
June 1 of the same year. The annual formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions. The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect beginning June 1
of the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and corresponding increases or decreases to operating revenues for any differences between the revenue
requirement in effect and ComEd s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s best estimate of the revenue requirement expected to be filed with the FERC for that year s reconciliation. The regulatory asset associated with
transmission  true-up  is amortized to Operating revenues within their Consolidated Statements of Operations of Comprehensive Income as the associated amounts are recovered through rates. On December 13,
2016, BGE filed with the FERC to modify its FERC-approved formula to recover its existing regulatory asset and any future changes to its regulatory asset concerning various tax issues including certain deferred income taxes.  
 For each of the following years, the following total increases/(decreases) were included in ComEd s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and
ACE s electric transmission formula rate filings:      

(a) 
 BGE s transmission revenues include a FERC approved dedicated facilities charge to recover the costs of providing transmission service to specifically designated load by BGE.    

(b) 
 In 2012, PJM terminated the MAPP transmission line construction project planned for the Pepco and DPL service territories. Pursuant to a FERC approved settlement agreement, the abandonment costs associated with MAPP
were being recovered in transmission rates over a three-year period that ended in May 2016.

 As part of the FERC-approved settlement of ComEd s 2007 transmission rate case, the rate of return on common equity is 11.50% and the common equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt
and equity return for the transmission formula rate is currently capped at 55%. As part of the FERC-approved settlement of the ROE complaint against BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE, the rate of return on common equity is 10.5%, inclusive of a 50 basis point
incentive adder for being a member of a regional transmission organization.

 The time period for any challenges to the annual transmission formula rate update flings expired with no challenges submitted.    
   PJM Transmission Rate Design and Operating Agreements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).   PJM Transmission
Rate Design specifies the rates for transmission service charged to customers within PJM. Currently, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE incur costs based on the existing rate design, which charges customers based on the cost of the existing
transmission facilities within their load zone and the cost of new transmission facilities based on those who benefit from those facilities. In April 2007, FERC issued an order concluding that PJM s current rate design for existing facilities
is just and reasonable and should not be changed. In the same order, FERC held that the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above should be socialized across the entire PJM footprint and that the costs of new facilities less than 500 kV should be
allocated to the customers of the new facilities who caused the need for those facilities. A number of parties appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for review of the decision.  
 In August 2009, the court issued its decision affirming the FERC s order with regard to the existing facilities, but remanded to FERC the issue of
the cost allocation associated with the new facilities 500 kV and above (Cost Allocation Issue) for further consideration by the FERC. On remand, FERC reaffirmed its earlier decision to socialize the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above. A
number of parties filed appeals of these orders. In June 2014, the court again remanded the Cost Allocation Issue to FERC. On December 18, 2014, FERC issued an order setting an evidentiary hearing and settlement proceeding regarding the Cost
Allocation Issue. On June 15, 2016, a number of parties, including Exelon and the Utility Registrants filed an Offer of Settlement with FERC. Each state that is a party in this proceeding either signed, or will not oppose, the settlement. If
the Settlement is approved, effective January 1, 2016, for the costs of the 500 kV facilities approved by the PJM Board on or after February 1, 2013, 50% will be socialized across PJM and 50% will be allocated according to an engineering
formula that calculates the flows on the transmission facilities. The Settlement includes provisions for monthly credits or charges that are expected to be mostly refunded or recovered through customer rates over a
 10-year  period based on negotiated numbers for charges prior to January 1, 2016.    Exelon expects that
the Settlement will not have a material impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL or ACE. The Settlement is subject to approval by FERC.

  The Utility Registrants are committed to the construction of transmission facilities under their
operating agreements with PJM to maintain system reliability. The Utility Registrants will work with PJM to continue to evaluate the scope and timing of any required construction projects. The Utility Registrant s estimated commitments are as

     Complaints at FERC Seeking to Mitigate Illinois and New York Programs Providing ZECs (Exelon and Generation).
  PJM and NYISO capacity markets include a Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) that is intended to preclude buyers from exercising buyer market power. If a resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer is adjusted to remove the revenues it receives
through a federal, state or other government-provided financial support program, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Currently, the MOPRs in PJM and NYISO apply only to certain new resources. Exelon has generally
opposed policies that require subsidies or give preferential treatment to generation providers or technologies that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefits, or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated
electricity grid. Thus, Exelon has supported a MOPR as a means of minimizing the detrimental impact certain subsidized resources could have on capacity markets (such as the New Jersey (LCAPP) and Maryland (CfD) programs). However, in Exelon s
view, MOPRs should not be applied to resources that receive compensation for providing superior reliability or environmental benefits.    On
January 9, 2017, the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) filed two requests with FERC: one seeking to amend a prior complaint against PJM and another seeking expedited action on a pending NYISO compliance filing in an existing proceeding.
Both filings allege that the relevant MOPR should be expanded to also apply to existing resources receiving ZEC compensation under the New York CES and Illinois ZES programs. Exelon has filed protests at FERC in response to each filing, arguing
generally that ZEC payments provide compensation for an environmental attribute that is distinct from the energy and capacity sold in the FERC-jurisdictional markets, and therefore, are no different than other renewable support programs like the PTC
and RPS that have generally not been subject to a MOPR. However, if successful, an expanded MOPR could result in mitigation of Generation s Quad Cities, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point facilities, which are expected to receive ZEC compensation, such
that they would have an increased risk of not clearing in future capacity auctions and thus of no longer receiving capacity revenues during the respective ZEC programs. This would also impact the FitzPatrick facility that Generation is currently in
the process of acquiring from Entergy. Any mitigation of these generating resources could have a material effect on Exelon s and Generation s future cash flows and results of operations. The timing of FERC s decision with respect to
both proceedings is currently unknown and the outcome of these matters is currently uncertain.      Demand Response Resource Order (Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).   On May 23, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion vacating the FERC Order No. 745 (D.C. Circuit Decision). Order No. 745 established uniform compensation levels
for demand response resources that participate in the day ahead and real-time wholesale energy markets. Under Order No. 745, buyers in ISO and RTO markets were required to pay demand response resources the full Locational Marginal Price when
the demand response replaced a generation resource and was

cost-effective. On January 25, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit Court decision and remanded the matter to the D.C. Circuit Court. While Exelon cannot predict exactly
how the D.C. Circuit Court will handle the matter on remand, Exelon does not expect there will be any significant change in how demand response resources have or will participate in and be paid by wholesale energy markets. Thus, Exelon does not
anticipate that there will be any impact to the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows based on these proceedings.     New England
Capacity Market Results (Exelon and Generation).  On February 28, 2014,  ISO-NE  filed the results of its eighth capacity auction (covering the June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2018 delivery
period). On June 27, 2014, the FERC issued a letter to  ISO-NE  noting that  ISO-NE s  February 28, 2014 filing was deficient and that  ISO-NE  must file additional information before the FERC can process the  filing. ISO-NE  filed the information on July 17, 2014, and the
 ISO-NE s  filings became effective by operation of law pursuant to a notice issued by the secretary of FERC on September 16, 2014. Several parties sought rehearing of the secretary s notice which
was effectively denied in October 2014 and have since appealed the matter to the D.C. Circuit Court. On October 25, 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court dismissed the appeal.  
   Operating License Renewals (Exelon and Generation).   Generation has  40-year  operating license
from the NRC for each of its nuclear units. The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process until completion of the NRC s review.  
 On December 9, 2014, Generation submitted an application to the NRC to extend the current operating licenses of LaSalle Units 1 and 2 by 20 years.
On October 19, 2016, the NRC approved Generation s request to extend the operating licenses of LaSalle units 1 and 2 by 20 years to 2042 and 2043, respectively.  
 On August 29, 2012, Generation submitted a hydroelectric license application to FERC for a  46-year  license
for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo). In connection with Generation s efforts to obtain a water quality certification pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act with Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) for
Conowingo, Generation continues to work with MDE and other stakeholders to resolve water quality licensing issues, including: (1) water quality, (2) fish habitat, and (3) sediment. In addition, Generation continues to work with MDE
and other Federal and Maryland state agencies to conduct and fund an additional sediment and nutrient monitoring study.    On August 7, 2015, US
Fish and Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior (Interior) submitted its modified fishway prescription to FERC in the Conowingo licensing proceedings. On September 11, 2015, Exelon filed a request for an administrative hearing
and proposed an alternative prescription to challenge Interior s preliminary prescription. On April 21, 2016, Exelon and Interior executed a Settlement Agreement resolving all fish passage issues between the parties. Accordingly, on
April 22, 2016, Exelon withdrew its Request for a Trial-Type Hearing and Alternative Prescription. The financial impact of the Settlement Agreement is estimated to be $3 million to $7 million per year, on average, over the  46-year  life of the new license, including both capital and operating costs. The actual timing and amount of these costs are not currently fixed and may vary significantly from year to year throughout the life of
the new license. Resolution of the remaining issues relating to Conowingo involving various stakeholders may have a material effect on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and financial position through an increase in capital
expenditures and operating costs. As of December 31, 2016, $28 million of direct costs associated with Conowingo licensing efforts have been
  capitalized-to-date.

   Regulatory Assets and Liabilities (Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)   
 Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE each prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for
accounting for certain types of regulation. Under this guidance, regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent
the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates or represent billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory
programs.    As a result of applying the acquisition method of accounting and pushing it down to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, certain
regulatory assets and liabilities were established at Exelon and PHI to offset the impacts of fair valuing the acquired assets and liabilities assumed which are subject to regulatory recovery. In total, Exelon and PHI recorded a net
$2.4 billion regulatory asset reflecting adjustments recorded as a result of the acquisition method of accounting. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information.

     Pension and other postretirement benefits.   As of December 31, 2016, Exelon had regulatory assets of
$3,075 and regulatory liabilities of $47 million related to ComEd s and BGE s portion of deferred costs associated with Exelon s pension plans and ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s portion of deferred costs associated with
Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans. PECO s pension regulatory recovery is based on cash contributions and is not included in the regulatory asset (liability) balances. The regulatory asset (liability) is amortized in proportion to
the recognition of prior service costs (gains), transition obligations and actuarial losses (gains) attributable to Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plans determined by the cost recognition provisions of the authoritative
guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits. ComEd, PECO and BGE will recover these costs through base rates as allowed in their most recently approved regulated rate orders. The pension and other postretirement benefit regulatory asset
balance includes a regulatory asset established at the date of the Constellation merger related to BGE s portion of the deferred costs associated with legacy Constellation s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The  BGE-related  regulatory asset is being amortized over a period of approximately 12 years, which generally represents the expected average remaining service period of plan participants at the date of the Constellation
merger. As of December 31, 2016, the pension and other postretirement benefits regulatory asset at Exelon includes regulatory assets of $1,087 million established at the date of the PHI Merger related to unrecognized costs that are
probable of regulatory recovery. The regulatory assets are amortized and recovered over periods from 3 to 15 years, depending on the underlying component. Pepco, DPL and ACE are currently recovering these costs through base rates. Pepco, DPL and ACE
are not earning a return on the recovery of these costs in base rates. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits for additional detail. No return is earned on Exelon s regulatory asset.  
   Deferred income taxes.   These costs represent the difference between the method by which the regulator allows for the recovery of income
taxes and how income taxes would be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets and liabilities associated with deferred income taxes, recorded in compliance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation and income taxes,
include the deferred tax effects associated principally with accelerated depreciation accounted for in accordance with the ratemaking policies of the ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC, as well as the revenue impacts thereon, and assume continued recovery of
these costs in future transmission and distribution rates. For BGE, this amount includes the impacts of a reduction in the deductibility, for Federal income

tax purposes, of certain retiree health care costs pursuant to the March 2010 Health Care Reform Acts. For BGE, these additional income taxes are being amortized over a  5-year  period that began in March 2011 in accordance with the MDPSC s March 2011 rate order. For PECO, this amount includes the impacts of electric and gas distribution repairs in the deductibility pursuant to
PUC s 2010 and 2015 rate case settlement agreements. As of December 31, 2016, includes transmission-related regulatory assets that require FERC approval separate from the transmission formula rate of $22 million, $38 million,
$31 million, $20 million and $19 million for ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, includes transmission-related regulatory assets that require FERC approval separate from the transmission formula
rate of $15 million, $16 million, $26 million, $18 million and $15 million for ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively. See Note 15 Income Taxes, Note 17 Retirement Benefits, and the Transmission Formula Rate
section above for additional information. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE are not earning a return on the regulatory asset in rates. The recovery period is over the life of the associated assets.  
   AMI programs.   For ComEd, this amount represents meter costs associated with ComEd s AMI pilot program approved in ComEd s 2010
rate case. The recovery periods for these meter costs are through January 2020. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, ComEd had regulatory assets of $162 million and $137 million, respectively, related to
accelerated depreciation costs resulting from the early retirements of  non-AMI  meters, which will be amortized over an average ten year period pursuant to the ICC approved AMI Deployment plan. ComEd is earning
a return on the regulatory asset. For PECO, this amount primarily represents accelerated depreciation on PECO s  non-AMI  meter assets over a  10-year  period ending
December 31, 2020. Recovery of smart meter costs are reflected in base rates effective January 1, 2016. For BGE, this amount represents AMI costs associated with the installation of smart meters and the early retirement of legacy meters.
The incremental costs associated with the installation, along with depreciation, amortization, and an appropriate return, had been building in a regulatory asset since the MDPSC approved the comprehensive smart grid initiative for BGE in August 2010
through approval of the program in BGE s rate order issued June, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the balance of BGE s regulatory asset was $230 million, which consists of three major components, including $144 million of
unamortized incremental deployment costs of the AMI program, $54 million of unamortized costs of the  non-AMI  meters replaced under the program, and $32 million related to post-test year incremental
program deployment costs incurred prior to when approval became effective June 2016. The incremental deployment costs for the AMI program and the  non-AMI  meter components of the regulatory asset are being
amortized and recovered through rates over a  10-year  period, which began in June, 2016. A return on the $144 million incremental deployment costs for the AMI program portion of the regulatory asset is
included in rates. The $54 million portion of the regulatory asset related to the unamortized cost of the retired  non-AMI  meters is not earning a return in rates. The $32 million portion related to
post-test year incremental program deployment costs have not yet been approved for recovery by the MDPSC and are not currently earning a return for financial reporting purposes. For PHI, this amount represents AMI costs associated with the
installation of smart meters and the early retirement of legacy meters throughout the service territories for Pepco and DPL. An AMI program has not been approved by the NJBPU for ACE in New Jersey. Pepco has received approval for recovery of
deferred AMI program costs from the DCPSC and the MDPSC in its DC and Maryland service territories. Pepco does earn a return on the AMI deployment costs, but not on the early retirement of legacy meters. DPL has received approval for recovery
of deferred AMI program costs from the DPSC in its Delaware service territory and has received a proposed order from the MDPSC approving recovery of deferred AMI program costs in its Maryland service territory. As of December 31, 2016, the DPL
deferred AMI program costs pending finalization of the proposed order from the MDPSC are $41 million, of which $14 million relates to retired legacy meters which are not earning a return.

    Under-recovered distribution services costs.   These amounts represent under recoveries
related to electric distribution services costs recoverable through EIMA s performance based formula rate. Under (over) recoveries for the annual reconciliations are recoverable (refundable) over a
 one-year  period and costs for certain  one-time  events, such as large storms, are recoverable over a five-year period. ComEd earns and pays a return on under and
over-recovered costs, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the regulatory asset was comprised of $134 million for the 2015 to 2016 annual reconciliations and $54 million related to significant
 one-time  events, including $20 million in deferred storm costs and $11 million of Constellation and PHI merger and integration related costs, and $23 million of smart meter related costs.
ComEd s 2015 annual reconciliation regulatory asset includes a reduction of $8 million related to a ComEd-proposed refund to customers for the impact of changing its OSHA recordable rate for 2014 and 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the
regulatory asset was comprised of $142 million for the 2014 and 2015 annual reconciliations and $47 million related to significant  one-time  events, including $36 million in deferred storm costs
and $11 million of Constellation merger and integration related costs.      Debt costs.   Consistent with rate recovery for ratemaking
purposes, ComEd s, PECO s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s recoverable losses on reacquired long-term debt related to regulated operations are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the new debt
issued to finance the debt redemption or over the life of the original debt issuance if the debt is not refinanced. Interest-rate swap settlements are deferred and amortized over the period that the related debt is outstanding or the life of the
original issuance retired. These debt costs are used in the determination of the weighted cost of capital applied to rate base in the rate-making process. ComEd and BGE are not earning a return on these costs. Recovery of these costs will continue
through 2038 for ComEd and BGE. PECO, Pepco, DPL and ACE are earning a return on the premium of the cost of the reacquired debt through base rates. The regulatory asset for Pepco, DPL and ACE was eliminated at Exelon and PHI as part of acquisition
accounting.      Fair value of long-term debt.   These amounts represent the unamortized regulatory assets recorded at Exelon for the
difference between the carrying value and fair value of the long-term debt of BGE as of the Constellation merger date based on the MDPSC practice to allow BGE to recover its debt costs through rates and at Exelon and PHI for the difference between
carrying value and fair value of long-term debt of Pepco, DPL and ACE as of the PHI Merger date. Exelon is amortizing the regulatory asset and the associated fair value over the life of the underlying debt and is not earning a return on the recovery
of these costs.      Fair value of PHI s unamortized energy contracts.   These amounts represent the regulatory asset recorded at
Exelon and PHI offsetting the fair value adjustments related to Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s electricity and natural gas energy supply contracts recorded at PHI as of the PHI Merger date. Pepco, DPL and ACE are allowed full recovery of
the costs of these contracts through their respective rate making processes.      Severance.   For BGE, these costs represent deferred
severance costs associated with a 2010 workforce reduction that were deferred as a regulatory asset and are being amortized over a  5-year  period that began in March 2011 in accordance with the MDPSC s
March 2011 rate order. Additionally, costs associated with the 2012 BGE voluntary workforce reduction were deferred in 2012 as a regulatory asset in accordance with the MDPSC s orders in prior rate cases and are being amortized over a  5-year  period that began in July 2012. BGE is earning a regulated return on the regulatory asset included in base rates.

    Asset retirement obligations.   These costs represent future legally required removal costs
associated with existing asset retirement obligations. PECO will begin to earn a return on, and a recovery of, these costs once the removal activities have been performed. ComEd and BGE will recover these costs through future depreciation rates and
will earn a return on these costs once the removal activities have been performed. The recovery period will be over the expected life of the related assets. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.  
   MGP remediation costs  . ComEd is allowed recovery of these costs under ICC approved rates. For PECO, these costs are recoverable through
rates as affirmed in the 2010 approved natural gas distribution rate case settlement. The period of recovery for both ComEd and PECO will depend on the timing of the actual expenditures,  c urrently estimated to be completed in 2022 for both
ComEd and PECO. ComEd and PECO are not earning a return on the recovery of these costs. While BGE does not have a rider for MGP  clean-up  costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual  clean-up  costs on a site-specific basis in distribution rates. For BGE, $5 million of  clean-up  costs incurred during the period from July 2000 through November 2005 and
an additional $1 million from December 2005 through November 2010 are recoverable through rates in accordance with MDPSC orders. BGE is earning a return on this regulatory asset and these costs are being amortized over  10-year  periods that began in January 2006 and December 2010, respectively. The recovery period for the  10-year  period that began January 2006 was extended for an additional
24 months, in accordance with the MDPSC approved 2014 electric and natural gas distribution rate case order. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.  
   Under recovered uncollectible accounts.   These amounts represent the difference between ComEd s annual uncollectible accounts expense
and revenues collected in rates through an  ICC-approved  rider. The difference between net uncollectible account charge-offs and revenues collected through the rider each calendar year is recovered or refunded
over a twelve-month period beginning in June of the following calendar year. ComEd does not earn a return on these under recoveries.  
   Renewable energy.   In December 2010, ComEd entered into several  20-year    floating-to-fixed   energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs through 2032 in order to meet a
portion of its obligations under the Illinois RPS. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012. Since the swap contracts were deemed prudent by the Illinois Settlement Legislation, ensuring ComEd of full recovery in rates, the changes in fair
value each period as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability are recorded by ComEd. ComEd does not earn (pay) a return on the regulatory asset (liability). Recovery of these costs will continue through 2032. The basis for the   mark-to-market   derivative asset or liability position is based on the difference between ComEd s cost to purchase energy at the market price and the contracted price.
     Energy and transmission programs.   These amounts represent under (over) recoveries related to energy and transmission costs
recoverable (refundable) under ComEd s ICC and/or FERC-approved rates. Under (over) recoveries are recoverable (refundable) over a  one-year  period or less. ComEd earns a return or interest on
under-recovered costs and pays interest on over-recovered costs to customers. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd s regulatory asset of $23 million included $15 million associated with transmission costs recoverable through its FERC
approved formula rate and $8 million of Constellation merger and integration costs to be recovered upon FERC approval. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd s regulatory liability of $60 million included $30 million related to
over-recovered energy costs and $30 million associated with revenues received for renewable energy requirements. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd s regulatory asset of $43 million included $5 million

related to under-recovered energy costs, $31 million associated with transmission costs recoverable through its FERC-approved formula rate tariff, and $7 million of Constellation merger
and integration costs to be recovered upon FERC approval. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd s regulatory liability of $53 million included $29 million related to over-recovered energy costs and $24 million associated with
revenues received for renewable energy requirements. See  Transmission Formula Rate  above for further details.    The PECO energy costs
represent the electric and gas supply related costs recoverable (refundable) under PECO s GSA and PGC, respectively. PECO earns interest on the under-recovered energy and natural gas costs and pays interest on over-recovered energy and natural
gas costs to customers. In addition, the DSP Program costs are presented on a net basis with PECO s GSA under (over)-recovered energy costs. These amounts represent recoverable administrative costs incurred relating to the filing and
procurement associated with PECO s PAPUC-approved DSP programs for the procurement of electric supply. The filings and procurements of these DSP Programs are recoverable through the GSA over each respective term. DSP II and DSP III each have a  24-month  term that began June 1, 2013 and June 1, 2015, respectively. The independent evaluator costs associated with conducting procurements are recoverable over a
 12-month  period after the PAPUC approves the results of the procurements. PECO is not earning a return on these costs. Certain costs included in PECO s original DSP program related to information
technology improvements were recovered over a  5-year  period that began January 1, 2011. PECO earns a return on the recovery of information technology costs. The PECO transmission costs represent the
electric transmission costs recoverable (refundable) under the TSC under which PECO earns interest on under-recovered costs and pays interest on over-recovered costs to customers. As of December 31, 2016, PECO s regulatory liability of
$56 million included $34 million related to over-recovered costs under the DSP program, $10 million related to over-recovered  non-bypassable  transmission service charges, $8 million related
to the over-recovered natural gas costs under the PGC and $4 million related to over-recovered electric transmission costs. As of December 31, 2015, PECO s regulatory asset of $1 million related to under-recovered  non-bypassable  transmission service charges. As of December 31, 2015, PECO s regulatory liability of $60 million included $35 million related to over-recovered costs under the DSP program,
$22 million related to the over-recovered natural gas costs under the PGC and $3 million related to the over-recovered electric transmission costs.  
 The BGE energy costs represent the electric supply, gas supply, and transmission related costs recoverable (refundable) from (to) customers under
BGE s market-based SOS program, MBR program, and FERC approved transmission rates, respectively. BGE earns or pays interest to customers on under-recovered or over-recovered FERC transmission formula-related costs. BGE does not earn or pay
interest to customers on under-recovered or over-recovered SOS and MBR costs. The recovery or refund period is a twelve-month period beginning in June of the following calendar year. As of December 31, 2016, BGE s regulatory asset of
$38 million included $4 million of costs associated with transmission costs recoverable through its FERC approved formula rate, $28 million related to under-recovered electric energy costs, $3 million of abandonment costs to be
recovered upon FERC approval, and $3 million related to under-recovered natural gas costs. As of December 31, 2015, BGE s regulatory asset of $40 million included $12 million of costs associated with transmission costs
recoverable through its FERC approved formula rate and $28 million related to under-recovered electric energy costs. As of December 31, 2015, BGE s regulatory liability of $18 million related to $14 million of
over-recovered transmission costs and $5 million of over-recovered natural gas costs, offset by $1 million of abandonment costs to be recovered upon FERC approval.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  For Pepco, DPL and ACE, amounts represent total incremental storm restoration costs incurred for repair
work due to major storm events in 2016, 2015, 2012 and 2011, including the January 2016 winter storm Jonas for Pepco, June 2015 storm (for DPL and ACE), Hurricane Sandy, the June 2012 derecho, Hurricane Irene and the 2011 severe winter storm (for
Pepco), that are recoverable from customers in the Maryland and New Jersey jurisdictions. Pepco s and DPL s costs related to Hurricane Sandy, the June 2012 derecho, Hurricane Irene and Pepco s costs related to the 2011 severe winter
storm are being amortized and recovered from customers, each over a five-year period. However, in the November 2016 Pepco Maryland Case No. 9418 order, the Commission ruled that the remaining amortization for the Pepco Maryland February 2010
storm, the January 2011 storm and Hurricane Irene be extended for an additional three years. The reason for the extension was that since these assets would be fully amortized in 2017, Pepco would over-recover these costs if the rates in this case
remained in effect beyond July 2017. The January 2017 PULJ report for DPL Maryland Case No. 9424 also recommended that amortization period for Hurricane Irene (DPL MD) be extended an additional three years as well. ACE s costs related to
Hurricane Sandy, the June 2012 derecho and Hurricane Irene are being amortized and recovered from customers, each over a three-year period. PHI does not earn a return on these ACE regulatory assets.  
   Electric generation-related regulatory asset.   As a result of the deregulation of electric generation, BGE ceased to meet the requirements
for accounting for a regulated business for the previous electric generation portion of its business. As a result, BGE  wrote-off  its entire individual, generation-related regulatory assets and liabilities and
established a single, generation-related regulatory asset to be collected through its regulated rates, which is being amortized on a basis that approximates the  pre-existing  individual regulatory asset
amortization schedules. The portion of this regulatory asset that does not earn a regulated rate of return was $9 million as of December 31, 2016, and $19 million as of December 31, 2015. BGE will continue to amortize this amount
through 2017.      Rate stabilization deferral.   In June 2006, Senate Bill 1 was enacted in Maryland and imposed a rate stabilization
measure that capped rate increases by BGE for residential electric customers at 15% from July 1, 2006, to May 31, 2007. As a result, BGE recorded a regulatory asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheets equal to the difference between the
costs to purchase power and the revenues collected from customers, as well as related carrying charges based on short-term interest rates from July 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. In addition, as required by Senate Bill 1, the MDPSC approved a
plan that allowed residential electric customers the option to further defer the transition to market rates from June 1, 2007 to January 1, 2008. During 2007, BGE deferred $306 million of electricity purchased for resale expenses and
certain applicable carrying charges, which are calculated using the implied interest rates of the rate stabilization bonds, as a regulatory asset related to the rate stabilization plans. During 2016 and 2015, BGE recovered $81 million and
$73 million, respectively, of electricity purchased for resale expenses and carrying charges related to the rate stabilization plan regulatory asset. BGE began amortizing the regulatory asset associated with the deferral which ended in May 2007
to earnings over a period not to exceed ten years when collection from customers began in June 2007.      Energy efficiency and demand response
programs.   For ComEd, these amounts represent over recoveries related to ComEd s  ICC-approved  Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Plan. ComEd expects to refund these over recoveries in 2017.
ComEd earns a return on the capital investment incurred under the program, but does not earn or pay a return or interest on under or over recoveries, respectively. For PECO, these amounts represent over recoveries of program costs related to both
Phase II and Phase III of its PAPUC-approved EE C Plan. PECO began recovering the costs of its Phase II and Phase III EE C Plans through a surcharge in June 2013 and June 2016, respectively,  

      371

based on projected spending under the programs. Phase II of the program began on June 1, 2013 and expired on May 31, 2016. Phase III of the program began on June 1, 2016 and will
expire on May 31, 2021. PECO does not earn (pay) interest on under (over) collections. For BGE, these amounts represent under (over) recoveries related to BGE s Smart Energy Savers
Program   , which includes both MDPSC-approved demand response and energy efficiency programs. For the BGE Peak Rewards SM  demand response
program which began in January 2008, actual marketing and customer bonus costs incurred in the demand response program are being recovered over a  5-year  amortization period from the date incurred pursuant to
an order by the MDPSC. Fixed assets related to the demand response program are recovered over the life of the equipment. Also included in the demand response program are customer bill credits related to BGE s Smart Energy Rewards program which
began in July 2013 and are being recovered through the surcharge. Actual costs incurred in the energy efficiency program are being amortized over a  5-year  period with recovery beginning in 2010 pursuant to an
order by the MDPSC. BGE earns a rate of return on the capital investments and deferred costs incurred under the program and earns (pays) interest on under (over) collections.  
 For Pepco, DPL and ACE, amounts represent recoverable costs associated with customer direct load control and energy efficiency and conservation programs
in all jurisdictions that are being recovered from customers. These programs are designed to reduce customers  energy consumption. PHI earns a return on these regulatory assets.  
   Merger integration costs.   These amounts include integration costs to achieve distribution synergies related to the Constellation merger
transaction. As a result of the MDPSC s February 2013 rate order, BGE deferred $8 million related to  non-severance  merger integration costs incurred during 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. Of
these costs, $4 million was authorized to be amortized over a  5-year  period that began in March 2013. The recovery of the remaining $4 million was deferred. In the MDPSC s December 2013 rate
order, BGE was authorized to recover the remaining $4 million and an additional $4 million of  non-severance  merger integration costs incurred during 2013. These costs are being amortized over a  5-year  period that began in December 2013. BGE is earning a return on this regulatory asset included in base rates.  
 These amounts also include integration costs to achieve distribution synergies related to the PHI acquisition. As of December 31, 2016, BGE s
regulatory asset of $10 million included $6 million of previously incurred PHI acquisition costs as authorized by the June 2016 rate case order. As of December 31, 2016, PHI s regulatory asset of $15 million represents
previously incurred PHI acquisition costs expected to earn a return and be recovered in distribution rates in the Maryland service territories of Pepco and DPL.  
   Under (Over)-recovered electric and gas revenue decoupling.   For BGE, these amounts represent the electric and gas distribution costs
recoverable from or (refundable) to customers under BGE s decoupling mechanisms, which does not earn a rate of return and is being recovered over the life of the associated assets. As of December 31, 2016, BGE had a regulatory asset of
$2 million related to under-recovered natural gas revenue decoupling and $1 million related to under-recovered electric revenue decoupling. As of December 31, 2015, BGE had a regulatory asset of $30 million related to
under-recovered electric revenue decoupling and a regulatory liability of $1 million related to over-recovered natural gas revenue decoupling.  
 For Pepco and DPL, these amounts represents the electric distribution costs recoverable from customers under Pepco s Maryland and District of
Columbia decoupling mechanisms and DPL s Maryland decoupling mechanism. Pepco and DPL earn a return on these regulatory assets.

    COPCO acquisition adjustment.   On July 19, 2007, the MDPSC issued an order which
provided for the recovery of a portion of DPL s goodwill. As a result of this order, $41 million in DPL goodwill was transferred to a regulatory asset. This item is being amortized from August 2007 through August 2018. DPL earns a return
of 12.95% on these regulatory assets.      Recoverable workers compensation and long-term disability costs.   These amounts represent
accrued workers  compensation and long-term disability costs for Pepco, which are recoverable from customers when actual claims are paid to employees. Pepco is not earning a return on the recovery of these costs and the recovery period is over
the life of the associated assets.      Vacation accrual.   These amounts represent accrued vacation costs for PECO, DPL and ACE. PECO, DPL
and ACE do not earn a return on these regulatory assets and the costs are recoverable from customers when actual payments are made to employees or when vacation is taken.  
   Securitized stranded costs.   These amounts represent certain contract termination payments under a contract between ACE and an unaffiliated
 non-utility  generator and costs associated with the regulated operations of ACE s electricity generation business that are no longer recoverable through customer rates (collectively referred to as
 stranded costs ). The stranded costs are amortized over the life of Transition Bonds issued by Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding) to securitize the recoverability of these stranded costs. These bonds mature
between 2017 and 2023. A customer surcharge is collected by ACE to fund principal and interest payments on the Transition Bonds. PHI earns a return on these regulatory assets.  
   CAP arrearage.   These amounts represent the guaranteed recovery of PECO s previously incurred bad debt expense associated with the
eligible CAP accounts receivable balances under the IPAF Program as provided by the 2015 electric distribution rate case settlement. These costs are amortized as recovery is received through a combination of customer payments over the duration
of the five-year payment agreement term and rate recovery, including through future rate cases if necessary. PECO is not earning a return on this regulatory asset.  
   Nuclear decommissioning.   These amounts represent estimated future nuclear decommissioning costs for the Regulatory Agreement Units that
exceed (regulatory asset) or are less than (regulatory liability) the associated decommissioning trust fund assets. Exelon believes the trust fund assets, including prospective earnings thereon and any future collections from customers, will be
sufficient to fund the associated future decommissioning costs at the time of decommissioning. Exelon is not accruing interest on these costs. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.  
   Removal costs.   These amounts represent funds ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE have received from customers through depreciation rates
to cover the future  non-legally  required cost of removal of property, plant and equipment which reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes. This liability is reduced as costs are incurred. PHI, Pepco, DPL, and
ACE have a regulatory asset which represents removal costs incurred in excess of amounts received from customers through depreciation rates recoverable from ratepayers. Pepco, DPL and ACE do not earn a return on these regulatory assets and the
recovery period is over the life of the associated assets.      Deferred rent.   Represents the regulatory liability recorded at Exelon and
PHI for deferred rent related to a lease. The costs of the lease are recoverable through the ratemaking process at Pepco, DPL and ACE.

    DLC program costs.   The DLC program costs include equipment, installation, and information
technology costs necessary to implement the DLC Program under PECO s EE C Phase I Plans. PECO received full cost recovery through Phase I collections and will amortize the costs as a credit to the income statement to offset the related
depreciation expense during the same period through September 2025, which is the remaining useful life of the assets. PECO is not paying interest on these over-recovered costs.  
   Electric distribution tax repairs.   PECO s 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement required that the expected cash benefit
from the application of Revenue Procedure  2011-43,  which was issued on August 19, 2011, to prior tax years be refunded to customers over a seven-year period. Credits began being reflected in customer
bills on January 1, 2012. PECO s 2015 electric distribution rate case settlement requires PECO to pay interest on the unamortized balance of the  tax-effected 
 catch-up  deduction beginning January 1, 2016.      Gas distribution tax repairs.   PECO s
2010 natural gas distribution rate case settlement required that the expected cash benefit from the application of new tax repairs deduction methodologies for 2010 and prior tax years be refunded to customers over a seven-year period. In September
2012, PECO filed an application with the IRS to change its method of accounting for gas distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. Credits began being reflected in customer bills on January 1, 2013. No interest will be paid to customers.  
  Capitalized Ratemaking Amounts Not Recognized (Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)   
 The following table illustrates our authorized amounts capitalized for ratemaking purposes related to earnings on shareholders  investment that are
not recognized for financial reporting purposes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the periods they are billable to our customers.

at face value and is permitted to recover uncollectible accounts expense, including those from Third Party Suppliers, from customers through distribution rates. ACE purchases receivables at face
value. ACE recovers all uncollectible accounts expense, including those from Third Party Suppliers, through the Societal Benefits Charge (SBC) rider, which includes uncollectible accounts expense as a component. The SBC is filed annually with
the NJBPU. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE do not record unbilled commodity receivables under the POR programs. Purchased billed receivables are classified in Other accounts receivable, net on Exelon s, ComEd s,
PECO s, BGE s, PHI s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following tables provide information about the purchased receivables of those companies as of December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015.      

(a) 
 For ComEd, BGE, Pepco and DPL, reflects the incremental allowance for uncollectible accounts recorded, which is in addition to the purchase discount. For ComEd, the incremental uncollectible accounts expense is
recovered through its Purchase of Receivables with Consolidated Billing tariff.    

(b) 
 PECO s natural gas POR program became effective on January 1, 2012 and included a 1% discount on purchased receivables in order to recover the implementation costs of the program. The implementation costs were
fully recovered and the 1% discount was reset to 0%, effective July 2015.    

(c) 
 Pepco s electric POR program in Maryland included a discount on purchased receivables ranging from 0% to 2% depending on customer class, and Pepco s electric POR program in the District of Columbia included a
discount on purchased receivables ranging from 0% to 6% depending on customer class. DPL s electric POR program in Maryland included a discount on purchased receivables ranging from 0% to 1% depending on customer class.    
    4. Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions (Exelon, Generation, PHI, DPL and Pepco)   
  Merger with Pepco Holdings, Inc. (Exelon)       Description
of Transaction      On March 23, 2016, Exelon completed the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement among Exelon, Purple Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon (Merger Sub) and Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI). As a result of that merger, Merger Sub was merged into PHI (the PHI Merger) with PHI surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon and Exelon Energy Delivery
Company, LLC (EEDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon which also owns Exelon s interests in ComEd, PECO and BGE (through a special purpose subsidiary in the case of BGE). Following the completion of the PHI Merger, Exelon and PHI completed a
series of internal corporate organization restructuring transactions resulting in the transfer of PHI s unregulated business interests to Exelon and Generation and the transfer of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE to a special purpose subsidiary of EEDC.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
    Regulatory Matters    
 Approval of the merger in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland and the District of Columbia was conditioned upon Exelon and PHI agreeing to certain commitments
including where applicable: customer rate credits, funding for energy efficiency and delivery system modernization programs, a green sustainability fund, workforce development initiatives, charitable contributions, renewable generation and other
required commitments. In addition, the orders approving the merger in Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland include a  most favored nation  provision which, generally speaking, requires allocation of merger benefits proportionally across all
the jurisdictions.    During the third and fourth quarters of 2016, Exelon and PHI filed proposals in Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland for amounts
and allocations reflecting the application of the most favored nation provision, resulting in a total nominal cost of commitments of $513 million excluding renewable generation commitments (approximately $444 million on a net present value
basis, excluding renewable generation commitments and charitable contributions). These filings, which reflect agreements reached with certain parties to the merger proceedings in the jurisdictions, were subject to regulatory review and approval in
each jurisdiction. The DPSC and NJBPU approved the amounts and allocations during the third and fourth quarters of 2016. An order from the MDPSC is expected in the first quarter of 2017. No changes in commitment cost levels are required in the
District of Columbia.    During the fourth quarter of 2016, the MDPSC approved a change in the application of $9 million in funding for
energy-efficiency program support in the DPL MD service territory. This resulted in an adjustment to the merger commitment costs recorded at Exelon Corporate and DPL. Exelon Corporate recorded a decrease and DPL recorded an increase of
$9 million in Operating and maintenance expense.    The following amounts were recognized as total commitment costs in Operating and maintenance
expense in Exelon s, PHI s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2016 and PHI s successor period:  

(a) 
 Included within the individual line items is the most favored nation provision estimate of $6 million, $5 million $38 million, $49 million and $134 million at Pepco, DPL, ACE, PHI and Exelon,
respectively.      Pursuant to the orders approving the merger, Exelon made $73 million, $46 million and $49 million of
equity contributions to Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively, in the second quarter of 2016 to fund the  after-tax  amounts of the customer bill credit and the customer base rate credit commitments.  
      376

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  In addition, Exelon is committed to develop or to assist in the commercial development of 37 MWs of new
generation in Maryland, District of Columbia, and Delaware, 27 MWs of which are to be completed by 2018. These investments are expected to total approximately $137 million, are expected to be primarily capital in nature, and will generate
future earnings at Exelon and Generation. Investment costs will be recognized as incurred and recorded on Exelon s and Generation s financial statements. Exelon has also committed to purchase 100 MWs of wind energy in PJM, to procure 120
MWs of wind RECs for the purpose of meeting Delaware s renewable portfolio standards, and to maintain and promote energy efficiency and demand response programs in the PHI jurisdictions.  
 Pursuant to the various jurisdictions  merger approval conditions, over specified periods Pepco, DPL and ACE are not permitted to reduce employment
levels due to involuntary attrition associated with the merger integration process and have made other commitments regarding hiring and relocation of positions.  
 Exelon was previously named in suits filed in the Delaware Chancery Court alleging that individual directors of PHI breached their fiduciary duties by
entering into the merger transaction and that Exelon aided and abetted the individual directors  breaches. The suits sought rescission of the merger and unspecified damages and costs. On June 1, 2016, the parties executed a settlement to
resolve all claims, subject to the approval of the Delaware Court. A hearing had been scheduled for September 8, 2016 in the Delaware Court to consider whether to approve the settlement. However, on August 19, 2016, the plaintiffs
advised Exelon that they had determined to dismiss the case in its entirety and with prejudice. On August 24, 2016, the Delaware Court issued an order approving the dismissal.  
 In July 2015, the OPC, Public Citizen, Inc., the Sierra Club and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN) filed motions to stay the MDPSC order
approving the merger and in July and August, Exelon, PHI, the MDPSC, Prince George s County and Montgomery County filed responses opposing the motions to stay. The judge issued an order denying the motions for stay on August 12, 2015. On
January 8, 2016, the Circuit Court judge affirmed the MDPSC s order approving the merger and denied the petitions for judicial review filed by the OPC, the Sierra Club, CCAN and Public Citizen, Inc. On January 19, 2016, the OPC
filed a notice of appeal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, and on January 21, 2016, the Sierra Club and CCAN filed a notice of appeal. On January 27, 2017, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court s
judgment. The OPC and Sierra Club have until the later of (i) 30 days from the date of the Court s order or (ii) 15 days from the date the Court enters its mandate, to file their petition for further review in the Court of Appeals. Exelon
cannot predict if the petition will be filed.    Between March 25, 2016 and April 22, 2016, various parties filed motions with the DCPSC to
reconsider its March 23, 2016 order approving the merger. On June 17, 2016, the DCPSC denied all motions. In August 2016, the District of Columbia Office of People s Counsel, the District of Columbia Government, and Public
Citizen jointly with DC Sun each filed petitions for judicial review of the DCPSC s March 23, 2016 order with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. On September 9, 2016, the Court consolidated the appeals. The Court has
issued a scheduling order, and a decision is expected in the second or third quarter of 2017. Exelon believes the matters are without merit.

    Accounting for the Merger Transaction    
 The total purchase price consideration of approximately $7.1 billion for the PHI Merger consisted of cash paid to PHI shareholders, cash paid for
PHI preferred securities and cash paid for PHI stock-based compensation equity awards as follows:      

(a) 
 As of December 31, 2015, the preferred stock was included in Other  non-current  assets on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets.    

(b) 
 PHI s unvested time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units issued prior to April 29, 2014 were immediately vested and paid in cash upon the close of the merger. PHI s
remaining unvested time-based restricted stock units as of the close of the merger were cancelled. There were no remaining unvested performance-based restricted stock units as of the close of the merger.    
 PHI shareholders received $27.25 of cash in exchange for each share of PHI common stock outstanding as of the effective date of the merger. In
connection with the Merger Agreement, Exelon entered into a Subscription Agreement under which it purchased $180 million of a new class of nonvoting, nonconvertible and nontransferable preferred securities of PHI prior to December 31,
2015. On March 23, 2016, the preferred securities were cancelled for no consideration to Exelon, and accordingly, the $180 million cash consideration previously paid to acquire the preferred securities was treated as purchase price
consideration.    The valuations performed in the first quarter of 2016 to assess the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed
were considered preliminary as a result of the short time period between the closing of the merger and the end of the first quarter of 2016. Accounting guidance provides that the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year from
the date of the merger as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Exelon expects to finalize these amounts in the first quarter of 2017. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2016,
certain modifications were made to preliminary valuation amounts for acquired property, plant and equipment, unamortized energy contracts, current liabilities, long-term debt, deferred income taxes and pension and OPEB liabilities resulting in an
$11 million net decrease to goodwill. The preliminary amounts recognized are subject to further revision to the extent that additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Any
changes to the fair value assessments may affect the purchase price allocation and could potentially impact goodwill.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  Exelon applied push-down accounting to PHI, and accordingly, the PHI assets acquired and liabilities
assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values on Exelon s and PHI s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 23, 2016, as follows:      
   On its successor financial statements, PHI has recorded, beginning March 24, 2016, Membership interest equity of
$7.2 billion, which is greater than the total $7.1 billion purchase price, reflecting the impact of a $59 million deferred tax liability recorded only at Exelon Corporate to reflect unitary state income tax consequences of the merger.
   The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed totaled $4.0 billion, which
was recognized as goodwill by PHI and Exelon at the acquisition date, reflecting the value associated with enhancing Exelon s regulated utility portfolio of businesses, including the ability to leverage experience and best practices across the
utilities and the opportunities for synergies. For purposes of future required impairment assessments, the goodwill has been preliminarily assigned to PHI s reportable units Pepco, DPL and ACE in the amounts of $1.7 billion,
$1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. None of this goodwill is tax deductible.    Immediately following closing of the merger,
$235 million of net assets included in the table above associated with PHI s unregulated business interests were distributed by PHI to Exelon. Exelon contributed $163 million of such net assets to Generation.  
 The fair values of PHI s assets and liabilities were determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature,
including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows, future market prices and impacts of utility rate regulation. There were also judgments made to determine the expected useful
lives assigned to each class of assets acquired.    Through its wholly-owned rate regulated utility subsidiaries, most of PHI s assets and
liabilities are subject to   cost-of-service   rate regulation. Under such regulation, rates charged to customers are established by a regulator to provide for recovery
of costs and a fair return on invested capital, or rate

base, generally measured at historical cost. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, for regulated assets and liabilities included in rate base or otherwise earning a return
(primarily property, plant and equipment and regulatory assets earning a return), no fair value adjustments were recorded as historical cost is viewed as a reasonable proxy for fair value.  
 Fair value adjustments were applied to the historical cost bases of other assets and liabilities subject to rate regulation but not earning a return
(including debt instruments and pension and OPEB obligations). In these instances, a corresponding offsetting regulatory asset or liability was also established, as the underlying utility asset and liability amounts are recoverable from or
refundable to customers at historical cost (and not at fair value) through the rate setting process. Similar treatment was applied for fair value adjustments to record intangible assets and liabilities, such as for electricity and gas energy
supply contracts as further described below. Regulatory assets and liabilities established to offset fair value adjustments are amortized in amounts and over time frames consistent with the realization or settlement of the fair value
adjustments, with no impact on reported net income. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the fair value of regulatory assets and liabilities established by Exelon and PHI.  
 Fair value adjustments were recorded at Exelon and PHI for the difference between the contract price and the market price of electricity and gas energy
supply contracts of PHI s wholly-owned rate regulated utility subsidiaries. These adjustments are intangible assets and liabilities classified as unamortized energy contracts on Exelon s and PHI s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2016. The difference between the contract price and the market price at the acquisition date of the Merger was recognized for each contract as either an intangible asset or liability. In total, Exelon and PHI recorded a
net $1.5 billion liability reflecting    out-of-the-money    contracts. The valuation of the acquired intangible assets and
liabilities was estimated by applying either the market approach or the income approach depending on the nature of the underlying contract. The market approach was utilized when prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions
involving comparable transactions were available. Otherwise the income approach, which is based upon discounted projected future cash flows associated with the underlying contracts, was utilized. In certain instances, the valuations were based upon
certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key estimates and inputs include forecasted power prices and the discount rate. The unamortized energy contract fair value adjustment
amounts and the corresponding offsetting regulatory asset and liability amounts are amortized through Purchase power and fuel expense or Operating revenues, as applicable, over the life of the applicable contract in relation to the present value of
the underlying cash flows as of the merger date.    As mentioned, under
  cost-of-service   rate regulation, rates charged to customers are established by a regulator to provide for recovery of costs and a fair return on invested capital, or
rate base, generally measured at historical cost. Historical cost information therefore is the most relevant presentation for the financial statements of PHI s rate regulated utility subsidiary registrants, Pepco, DPL and ACE. As
such, Exelon and PHI did not push-down the application of acquisition accounting to PHI s utility registrants, and therefore the financial statements of Pepco, DPL and ACE do not reflect the revaluation of any assets and liabilities.  
 The current impact of PHI, including its unregulated businesses, on Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income
includes Operating revenues of $3,785 million and Net loss of $(66) million during the year ended December 31, 2016.

  For the periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Exelon and PHI have recognized expense to
achieve the PHI acquisition as follows:      

(a) 
 The costs incurred are classified primarily within Operating and maintenance expense in the Registrants  respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, with the exception of the
financing costs, which are included within Interest expense. Costs do not include merger commitments discussed above.    

(b) 
 Reflects costs (benefits) recorded at Exelon related to financing, including   mark-to-market   activity on forward-starting interest rate
swaps.    

(c) 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, includes the reversal of previously incurred acquisition, integration and financing costs of $8 million, $6 million, $11 million, $4 million, and
$16 million incurred at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and PHI, respectively, that have been deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset for anticipated recovery. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for more information.    
    Pro-forma  Impact of the Merger    
 The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Exelon as if the merger with PHI had taken
place on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma information was calculated after applying Exelon s accounting policies and adjusting PHI s results to reflect purchase accounting adjustments.  
 The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of results of
operations that would have been achieved had the merger events taken place on the dates indicated, or the future consolidated results of operations of the combined company.

 The amounts above exclude  non-recurring  costs directly related to the merger of $92 million and intercompany revenue of $559 million for the year ended December 31,
2015.       Acquisition of ConEdison Solutions (Exelon and Generation)   
 On September 1, 2016, Generation acquired the competitive retail electricity and natural gas business of Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc.
(ConEdison Solutions), a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. for a purchase price of $257 million including net working capital of $204 million. The renewable energy, sustainable services and energy efficiency businesses of ConEdison
Solutions are excluded from the transaction. As of December 31, 2016, Generation had remitted $235 million to ConEdison Solutions and the remaining balance of $22 million, which is included in Other current liabilities on
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets, will be paid during the first quarter of 2017.    The following table summarizes the
acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities assumed for the ConEdison Solutions acquisition by Generation as of September 1, 2016:

The purchase price equaled the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and,
therefore, no goodwill or bargain purchase was recorded as of December 31, 2016. The purchase accounting is preliminary, and, although not expected, may be further adjusted from what is shown above. Accounting guidance provides that the
allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year from the date of the acquisition as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, Generation expects to finalize these amounts
by the first quarter of 2017.    The fair values of ConEdison Solutions  assets and liabilities were determined based on significant estimates
and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows and future power and fuel market prices.

   Proposed Acquisition of James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Generating Station (Exelon and Generation)   
 On August 8, 2016, Generation executed a series of agreements with Entergy Nuclear FitzPatrick LLC (Entergy) to acquire the 838 MW single-unit James
A. FitzPatrick (FitzPatrick) nuclear generating station located in Scriba, New York for a cash purchase price of $110 million. As part of the transaction, Generation would receive the FitzPatrick NDT fund assets and assume the obligation to
decommission FitzPatrick. The NRC license for FitzPatrick expires in 2034. In November 2015, Entergy had announced plans to early retire FitzPatrick at the end of the current fuel cycle in January 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, Generation
will reimburse Entergy for approximately $200 million to $250 million of incremental costs to prepare for and conduct the plant refueling outage as well as to operate and maintain the plant after the refueling outage, scheduled to end in
February 2017, through the closing date. These are costs which otherwise would have been avoided by FitzPatrick s planned permanent shutdown in January 2017. Generation will be entitled to all revenues from FitzPatrick s electricity and
capacity sales for the period commencing upon completion of the refueling outage through the acquisition closing date. The agreements provide for certain termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate if the transaction has not
been consummated within 12 months due to failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals.    Closing of the transaction is currently anticipated
to occur in the first half of 2017 and requires regulatory approval by FERC, NRC, and the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC). The transaction is also subject to the notification and reporting requirements of the HSR Act (which had been
completed) and other customary closing conditions. On November 17, 2016 the NYPSC issued an order approving the transaction. On October 11, 2016, Public Citizen, Inc. filed a protest with FERC challenging Generation and Entergy s
application to FERC for the transfer of ownership of FitzPatrick. No other party to the FERC proceeding filed any protests or comments. On December 7, 2016 FERC approved Generation s acquisition of the FitzPatrick facility and dismissed
the Public Citizen protest. Public Citizen filed a request for rehearing on January 6, 2017. NRC is the final regulatory approval required to close the transaction and is anticipated during the first half of 2017.  
 The transaction is expected to be accounted for as a business combination. For accounting and financial reporting purposes, the costs for which
Generation reimburses Entergy as well as the revenue received from FitzPatrick prior to the closing of the transaction will be treated as part of the purchase price consideration. Generation will record the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. To the extent the purchase price is greater than the fair value of the net assets acquired, goodwill will be recorded. To the extent the fair value of the net assets acquired is greater than the
purchase price, a bargain purchase gain will be recorded.    As of December 31, 2016, Generation has recorded $127 million of purchase price
consideration in Other noncurrent assets on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash outflows associated with these amounts are reflected within Acquisition of businesses on Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the event the acquisition does not close, these amounts would be subject to potential  write-off  to Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Exelon and Generation incurred $19 million of merger and integration related costs which are included within Operating and
maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

   Acquisition of Integrys Energy Services, Inc. (Exelon and Generation)   
 On November 1, 2014, Generation acquired the competitive retail electric and natural gas business activities of Integrys Energy Group, Inc. through
the purchase of all of the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, Integrys Energy Services, Inc. (IES) for a purchase price of $332 million including net working capital. Generation has elected to account for the transaction as an asset
acquisition for federal income tax purposes. The generation and solar asset businesses of Integrys are excluded from the transaction. The Purchase Agreement also includes various representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification and other
provisions customary for a transaction of this nature.    Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed was determined as of the acquisition date through the use of significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions used include: projected future cash
flows (including the amount and timing); discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows; and future power and fuel market prices.  
 The following table summarizes the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities assumed for the Integrys
acquisition by Generation:

The  after-tax  bargain purchase gain of $28 million is primarily the result
of IES executing additional contract volumes between the date the acquisition agreement was signed and the closing of the transaction resulting in an increase in the fair value of the net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. The  after-tax  gain is included within Gain on consolidation and acquisition of businesses in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
 IES s operating revenues and net loss included in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income for the period from November 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 were $386 million and $(42) million, respectively. The net loss for the period from November 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 includes  pre-tax  unrealized losses on derivative contracts of $108 million and the bargain purchase gain of $28 million. It is impracticable to determine the overall financial statement impact of IES for 2015 and
2016 due to the integration of the business into ongoing operations. For the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, Exelon and Generation incurred $5 million and $7 million, respectively, of merger and integration related costs
which are included within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

   Asset Divestitures (Exelon, Generation, PHI, Pepco and DPL)   
 On November 10, 2015, Pepco completed the sale of a 3.5 acre parcel of unimproved land (held as  non-utility 
property) in the Buzzard Point area of southeast Washington, D.C., resulting in a  pre-tax  gain of $37 million.  
 On December 31, 2015, Pepco completed the sale of a 3.8 acre parcel of unimproved land (held as  non-utility 
property) in the NoMa area of northeast Washington, D.C., resulting in a  pre-tax  gain of $9 million. The purchase and sale agreement also provided the third party with a
 90-day  option to purchase the remaining 1.8 acre land parcel.    On April 21, 2016, Generation completed
the sale of the retired New Boston generating site, located in Boston, Massachusetts, resulting in a  pre-tax  gain of approximately $32 million.  
 On May 2, 2016, Pepco completed the sale of the remaining 1.8 acre land parcel noted above, located in the NoMa area of northeast Washington, D.C.,
resulting in a  pre-tax  gain of approximately $8 million at Pepco. Due to the fair value adjustments recorded at Exelon and PHI as part of purchase accounting, no gain was recorded in Exelon s and
PHI s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.    On June 16, 2016, Generation initiated the sales process of its
Upstream business by executing a forbearance agreement with the lenders of the nonrecourse debt. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. In December 2016, Generation sold substantially all of the Upstream assets for
$37 million which resulted in a  pre-tax  loss on sale of $10 million which is included in Gain (loss) on sales of assets on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2016.    In July 2016, DPL completed the sale of a 9 acre land parcel located on South
Madison Street in Wilmington, DE, resulting in a  pre-tax  gain of approximately $4 million. In December 2016, DPL completed the sale of a 48 acre land parcel located in Middletown, DE, resulting in a  pre-tax  gain of approximately $5 million. Due to the fair value adjustments recorded at Exelon and PHI as part of purchase accounting, no gain was recorded in Exelon s and PHI s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.    During the fourth quarter, as part of its continual assessment of growth and development
opportunities, Generation has reevaluated and in certain instances terminated or renegotiated certain projects and contracts. As a result a  pre-tax  loss of $69 million was recorded within Loss on sale of
assets and  pre-tax  impairment charges of $23 million were recorded within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income.       5. Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC (Exelon and Generation)   
 Generation owns a 50.01% interest in CENG, a nuclear generation business. Generation has historically had various agreements with CENG to purchase power
and to provide certain services. For further information regarding these agreements, see Note 27 Related Party Transactions.    On April 1,
2014, Generation and subsidiaries of Generation and CENG entered into a Nuclear Operating Services Agreement (NOSA) pursuant to which Generation will operate the CENG nuclear

generation fleet owned by CENG subsidiaries and provide corporate and administrative services for the remaining life of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear
fleet, subject to EDF s rights as a member of CENG (the Integration Transaction). CENG will reimburse Generation for its direct and allocated costs for such services. As part of the arrangement, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, LLC, a
subsidiary of CENG, also assigned to Generation its obligations as Operator of Nine Mile Point Unit 2 under an operating agreement with Long Island Power Authority, the Unit 2  co-owner.  In addition, on
April 1, 2014, the Power Services Agency Agreement (PSAA) was amended and extended until the permanent cessation of power generation by the CENG generation plants.  
 In addition, on April 1, 2014, Generation made a $400 million loan to CENG, bearing interest at 5.25% per annum and payable out of
specified available cash flows of CENG or payable upon the maturity date of April 1, 2034. Immediately following receipt of the proceeds of such loan, CENG made a $400 million special distribution to EDF. Unpaid principal and accrued
interest on the loan was $316 million as of December 31, 2016.    Exelon, Generation, and subsidiaries of Generation, EDF and CENG also
executed a Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement for CENG on April 1, 2014, pursuant to which, among other things, CENG committed to make preferred distributions to Generation (after repayment of the $400 million loan and
associated interest) quarterly out of specified available cash flows until Generation has received aggregate distributions of $400 million plus a return of 8.5% per annum from April 1, 2014 (Preferred Distribution Rights).  
 Generation and EDF also entered into a Put Option Agreement on April 1, 2014, pursuant to which EDF has the option, exercisable beginning on
January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022, to sell its 49.99% interest in CENG to Generation for a fair market value price determined by agreement of the parties, or absent agreement, a third-party arbitration process. The
appraisers determining fair market value of EDF s 49.99% interest in CENG under the Put Option Agreement are instructed to take into account all rights and obligations under the CENG Operating Agreement, including Generation s rights with
respect to any unpaid aggregate preferred distributions and the related return, and the value of Generation s rights to other distributions. Under limited circumstances, the period for exercise of the put option may be extended for 18 months.
In order to exercise its option, EDF must give 60 days advance written notice to Generation stating that it is exercising its option. As of the date these financial statements were issued, EDF has not given notice to Generation that it is exercising
its option.    On April 1, 2014, Generation also executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation indemnified EDF against third-party
claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation s obligations under this indemnity.  
 In addition, on April 1, 2014, Generation, EDF, CENG and Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, LLC entered into an Employee Matters Agreement (EMA) that
provides for the transfer of CENG employees to Exelon or one of its affiliates and Exelon s assumption of the sponsorship of the employee benefit plans (including certain incentive, health and welfare, and postemployment benefit plans, among
others) and their related trusts by Exelon as the plan sponsor as of July 14, 2014. The EMA also generally requires CENG to fund the obligation related to  pre-transfer  service of employees, including the
underfunded balance of the pension and other postretirement welfare benefit plans measured as of July 14, 2014 by making periodic payments to Generation. These payments will be made on an agreed payment schedule or upon the occurrence of
certain specified events, such as EDF s disposition of a

majority of its interest in CENG. However, in the event that EDF exercises its rights under the Put Option, all payments not made as of the put closing date shall accelerate to be paid
immediately prior to such closing date.    As a condition to obtaining regulatory approval for the NOSA and related transactions from the NRC, Exelon
executed a support agreement pursuant to which Exelon may be required under specified circumstances to provide up to $245 million of financial support to CENG (Exelon Support Agreement). The Exelon Support Agreement supersedes a previous
support agreement under which Generation had agreed to provide up to $205 million of financial support for CENG. In addition, Exelon executed a Guarantee pursuant to which Exelon may be required under specified circumstances to provide up to
$165 million in additional financial support for CENG. A previous support agreement executed by an affiliate of EDF remains in effect under which the EDF affiliate may be required to provide up to approximately $145 million of financial
support for CENG under specified circumstances. The agreements were executed on April 1, 2014 when the NRC licenses were transferred to Generation. No liability has been recognized by Exelon for the guarantees.  
 Prior to April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation accounted for their investment in CENG under the equity method of accounting. From January 1,
2014, through March 31, 2014, Generation recorded $19 million of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates related to its investment in CENG and recorded $17 million of revenues from CENG. The book value of Generation s
investment in CENG prior to the consolidation was $1.9 billion, and the book value of the AOCI related to CENG prior to consolidation was $116 million, net of taxes of $77 million.  
 As a result of the consolidation of CENG on April 1, 2014, there are several additional transactions included in Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Financial Statements between CENG and Exelon s affiliates that are considered related party transactions to Generation. As further described in Note 27 Related Party Transactions, EDF and Generation had a PPA
with CENG under which they purchased 15% and 85%, respectively, of the nuclear output owned by CENG that was not sold to third parties under  pre-existing  PPAs through December 31, 2014. Beginning
January 1, 2015 and continuing through the life of the respective plants, EDF and Generation purchase 49.99% and 50.01%, respectively, of the nuclear output owned by CENG not subject to other contractual agreements. Beginning April 1,
2014, CENG s sales to Generation have been eliminated in consolidation. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 Generation had sales to EDF of $376 million, $488 million, and $137 million respectively. See
discussion above and Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for additional information regarding other transactions between CENG and EDF included within Exelon and Generation s consolidated financial statements and for additional information
about the Registrants VIE s.      Accounting for the Consolidation of CENG    
 The transfer of the nuclear operating licenses and the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, resulted in the derecognition of the equity method
investment in CENG and the recording of all assets, liabilities and EDF s noncontrolling interests in CENG at fair value on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the consolidation, Exelon and Generation
recorded a net gain of $261 million within their respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. This gain consists of approximately $136 million related to the step up to fair value basis of Generation s
ownership interest in CENG, and approximately $132 million related to the settlement of  pre-existing  transactions between CENG and Generation. The net gain on the consolidation of CENG of
$261 million is net of a $7 million payment to EDF.  
      387

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  The fair value of CENG s assets and liabilities recorded in consolidation was determined based on
significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including projected future cash flows (including timing); discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows; and future market prices. There were also judgments made
to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and duration of liabilities assumed.    The valuations necessary to
assess the fair values of certain assets and liabilities were considered preliminary as a result of the short time period between the execution of the NOSA and the end of the second quarter of 2014. The estimates of the fair value of assets and
liabilities could be modified for up to one year from April 1, 2014, as more information was obtained about the fair value of assets and liabilities. The principal items that have been revised include the asset retirement obligation liabilities
and related asset retirement costs. These items have been updated with inputs from a third party engineering firm with corresponding adjustments recorded in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for
discussion of the impacts of adjustments recorded during 2014 and 2015 related to updated estimates of the CENG asset retirement obligation liabilities. In the period of such revisions, these and any other material changes to the fair value
assessments have resulted in adjustments to the amounts recorded upon consolidation. In addition, the asset or liability adjustments impacting depreciation and/or accretion expense recorded after the consolidation date have impacted
Generation s post-consolidation results of operations.    Generation recorded the assets and liabilities of CENG at fair value as of
April 1, 2014. The following assets and liabilities of CENG were recorded within Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the date of integration, adjusted for the modifications discussed above:  
   
   Generation also recorded the fair value of the noncontrolling interests on its Consolidated Balance Sheets of
approximately $1.5 billion, net of the fair value of $152 million for certain specified additional distribution rights under the Operating Agreement. In addition, the noncontrolling interests was further reduced by the $400 million
special cash distribution to EDF.    Due to the Preferred Distribution Rights that Generation has on CENG s available cash, the earnings
attributable to the noncontrolling interests on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as well as the corresponding adjustment to Noncontrolling interests on the  
      388

Consolidated Balance Sheets will not be in proportion to Generation s and EDF s equity ownership interests. Rather, the attribution will consider Generation s Preferred
Distribution Rights and allocate net income based on each owner s rights to CENG s net assets. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Generation reduced by $20 million and $18 million, respectively, the amount of
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. As a result of the consolidation, Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income includes CENG s incremental operating revenues of $548 million and $509 million and CENG s net income (loss), prior to any intercompany eliminations and any adjustments for noncontrolling
interests, of $201 million and $(11) million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    Exelon and Generation
incurred no merger integration-related costs in 2016. However, in 2015 Exelon and Generation incurred $2 million of merger related integration costs. The costs incurred are classified primarily within Operating and maintenance expense in
Exelon s and Generation s respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.       6. Accounts Receivable
(All Registrants)     Accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 and 2015 included estimated unbilled revenues, representing an estimate for the
unbilled amount of energy or services provided to customers, and is net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts as follows:      

(a) 
 Represents unbilled portion of retail receivables estimated under Exelon s unbilled critical accounting policy.    

(b) 
 Includes the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer and other accounts receivable.    

(c) 
 Excludes the  non-current  allowance for uncollectible accounts of $23 million and $8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to PECO s
current installment plan receivables described below.    

(d) 
 At December 31, 2016, as explained in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE estimated the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates to the
outstanding receivable balance by risk segment. The change in estimate resulted in an overall increase of $30 million, $14 million, $8 million, and $8 million in the allowance for uncollectible accounts with $20 million,
$8 million, $4 million, and $8 million deferred as a regulatory asset on PHI s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016, respectively. This also resulted in a
$10 million, $6 million, and $4 million  pre-tax  charge to provision for uncollectible accounts expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is included in Operating and maintenance
expense on PHI s, Pepco s, and DPL s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, respectively.    
   PECO Installment Plan Receivables (Exelon and PECO).   PECO enters into payment agreements with certain delinquent customers, primarily
residential, seeking to restore their service, as required by the PAPUC. Customers with past due balances that meet certain income criteria are provided the option to enter into an installment payment plan, some of which have terms greater than

one year, to repay past due balances in addition to paying for their ongoing service on a current basis. The receivable balance for these payment agreement receivables is recorded in accounts
receivable for the current portion and other deferred debits and other assets for the noncurrent portion. The net receivable balance for installment plans with terms greater than one year was $9 million and $15 million at December 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible accounts reserve methodology and assessment of the credit quality of the installment plan receivables are consistent with the customer accounts receivable methodology discussed in Note
1 Significant Accounting Policies. The allowance for uncollectible accounts balance associated with these receivables at December 31, 2016 of $13 million consists of $1 million, $3 million and $9 million for low risk,
medium risk and high risk segments, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible accounts balance associated with these receivables at December 31, 2015 of $15 million consists of $1 million, $3 million and $11 million for
low risk, medium risk and high risk segments, respectively. The balance of the payment agreement is billed to the customer in equal monthly installments over the term of the agreement. Installment receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2016
and 2015 include balances not yet presented on the customer bill, accounts currently billed and an immaterial amount of past due receivables. When a customer defaults on its payment agreement, the terms of which are defined by plan type, the entire
balance of the agreement becomes due and the balance is reclassified to current customer accounts receivable and reserved for in accordance with the methodology discussed in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies.

  Long-Lived Assets (Exelon and Generation)     Generation
evaluates long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the second quarter of 2016, updates to the Company s long-term view of
energy and capacity prices suggested that the carrying value of a group of merchant wind assets, located in West Texas, may be impaired. Upon review, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of the group were less than their
carrying value. The fair value analysis was based on the income approach using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. As a result of
the fair value analysis, long-lived merchant wind assets held and used with a carrying amount of approximately $60 million were written down to their fair value of $24 million and a  pre-tax 
impairment charge of $36 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2016 in Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
 Also in the second quarter of 2016, updates to the Company s long-term view, as described above, in conjunction with the retirement announcements
of the Quad Cities and Clinton nuclear plants in Illinois suggested that the carrying value of our Midwest asset group may be impaired. Generation completed a comprehensive review of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the Midwest
asset group and no impairment charge was required.  
      396

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  In 2015, the year over year change in fundamentals did not indicate any impairments. In 2014, the year
over year change in fundamentals suggested that the carrying value of certain merchant wind assets may be impaired. Generation concluded that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of twelve wind projects, primarily located in
West Texas, were less than their respective carrying values at May 31, 2014. As a result, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of approximately $151 million were written down to their fair value of $65 million and a  pre-tax  impairment charge of $86 million was recorded within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
 During the first quarter of 2016, significant changes in Generation s intended use of the Upstream oil and gas assets, developments with
nonrecourse debt held by its upstream subsidiary CEU Holdings, LLC (as described in Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements) and continued declines in both production volumes and commodity prices suggested that the carrying value may be impaired.
Generation concluded that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of its Upstream properties were less than their carrying values. As a result, a  pre-tax  impairment charge of
$119 million was recorded in March 2016 within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. On June 16, 2016, Generation initiated the sales
process of its Upstream natural gas and oil exploration and production business by executing a forbearance agreement with the lenders of the nonrecourse debt, see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information. An additional  pre-tax  impairment charge of $15 million was recorded in September 2016 within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income due to further declines in fair value. In December 2016, Generation sold substantially all of the Upstream Assets. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information.  
 During 2015 and 2014, significant declines in oil and gas prices suggested that the carrying value of certain Upstream assets may be impaired.
Generation concluded that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of various Upstream properties, primarily located in Oklahoma and Texas, were less than their respective carrying values at December 31, 2015 and 2014. As a
result,  pre-tax  impairment charges of $5 million and $124 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, within Operating and maintenance expense within
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.    The fair value analysis used in the above
impairments was primarily based on the income approach using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including revenue, generation and production forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. Changes in the
assumptions described above could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon s long-lived assets, which could be material.    In 2014,
certain  non-nuclear  generating assets were identified as assets held for sale on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. When long-lived assets are held for sale, an impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Long-lived assets with a carrying amount of approximately $1 billion were written down to their fair value of $556 million
and a  pre-tax  impairment charge of $450 million was recorded within Operating and maintenance expense and is included in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for further information on asset sales.

   Like-Kind Exchange Transaction (Exelon)   
 In June 2000, UII, LLC (formerly Unicom Investments, Inc.) (UII), a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon Corporation, entered into transactions pursuant to
which UII invested in coal-fired generating station leases (Headleases) with the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG). The generating stations were leased back to MEAG as part of the transactions (Leases).  
 Pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance, Exelon is required to review the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments at
least annually and record an impairment charge if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying values. Exelon estimates the fair value of the residual values of its direct
financing lease investments under the income approach, which uses a discounted cash flow analysis, which takes into consideration significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including the expected revenues to be generated and costs to be incurred to
operate the plants over their remaining useful lives subsequent to the lease end dates. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value include fundamental energy and capacity prices, fixed and variable costs, capital expenditure
requirements, discount rates, tax rates, and the estimated remaining useful lives of the plants. The estimated fair values also reflect the cash flows associated with the service contract option discussed above given that a market participant would
take into consideration all of the terms and conditions contained in the lease agreements.    Based on the annual reviews performed in the second
quarters of 2015 and 2014, the estimated residual value of Exelon s direct financing leases for the Georgia generating stations experienced other than temporary declines given increases in estimated long-term operating and maintenance costs in
the 2015 annual review and reduced long-term energy and capacity price expectations in the 2014 annual review. As a result, Exelon recorded $24 million  pre-tax  impairment charges in both 2015 and 2014 for
these stations. These impairment charges were recorded within Investments and Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, respectively. All
the Headleases were terminated by the second quarter of 2016, and no events occurred prior to the termination that required Exelon to review the estimated residual values of the direct financing lease investments in 2016.  
 On February 26, 2014, UII and the City Public Service Board of San Antonio, Texas (CPS) finalized an agreement to terminate the leases on the
generating station located in Texas, as described above, prior to its expiration dates. As a result of the lease termination, UII received a net early termination amount of $335 million from CPS and wrote down the net investment in the CPS
long-term lease of $336 million in Investments in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2014; resulting in a  pre-tax  loss of $1 million being reflected in Operating and maintenance expense in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in 2014.    On March 31, 2016, UII and MEAG finalized an agreement to
terminate the MEAG Headleases, the MEAG Leases, and other related agreements prior to their expiration dates. As a result of the lease termination, UII received an early termination payment of $360 million from MEAG and  wrote-off  the $356 million net investment in the MEAG Headleases and the Leases. The transaction resulted in a  pre-tax  gain of $4 million which is reflected in
Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 15 Income Taxes for additional information.  
 As of December 31, 2016, all the long-term leases had been terminated and no residual and net investment value was outstanding. At
December 31, 2015, the components of the net investment in the  
      398

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
long-term leases consisted of estimated residual value of $639 million, unearned income of $287 million and a resulting net investment of $352 million.  
    9. Early Nuclear Plant Retirements (Exelon and Generation)   
 Exelon and Generation continue to evaluate the current and expected economic value of each of Generation s nuclear plants. Factors that will
continue to affect the economic value of Generation s nuclear plants include, but are not limited to: market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential legislative and regulatory solutions to ensure nuclear plants are fairly
compensated for their carbon-free emissions, and the impact of final rules from the EPA requiring reduction of carbon and other emissions and the efforts of states to implement those final rules.  
 In 2015, Generation identified the Quad Cities, Clinton and Ginna nuclear plants as having the greatest risk of early retirement based on economic
valuation and other factors. At that time, Exelon and Generation deferred retirement decisions on Clinton and Quad Cities until 2016 in order to participate in the 2016-2017 MISO primary reliability auction and the 2019-2020 PJM capacity auctions
held in April and May 2016, respectively, as well as to provide Illinois policy makers with additional time to consider needed reforms and for MISO to consider market design changes to ensure long-term power system reliability in southern Illinois.
   In April 2016, Clinton cleared the MISO primary reliability auction as a price taker for the 2016-2017 planning year. The resulting capacity price
was insufficient to cover cash operating costs and a risk-adjusted rate of return to shareholders. In May 2016, Quad Cities did not clear in the PJM capacity auction for the 2019-2020 planning year and will not receive capacity revenue for that
period.    Based on these capacity auction results, and given the lack of progress on Illinois energy legislation and MISO market reforms, on
June 2, 2016 Generation announced it would move forward to shut down the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants on June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018, respectively. The current Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licenses for Clinton and
Quad Cities expire in 2026 and 2032, respectively.    In June 2016, as a result of the retirement decision for Clinton and Quad Cities, Exelon and
Generation recognized  one-time  charges in Operating and maintenance expense of $146 million related to materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, employee-related costs and construction   work-in-progress   (CWIP) impairments, among other items. In addition to these  one-time  charges, Exelon and Generation began recognizing
incremental  non-cash  charges to earnings stemming from shortening the expected economic useful life of Clinton and Quad Cities, including accelerated depreciation of plant assets (along with any asset
retirement costs (ARC)), accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel, and additional asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion expense associated with the changes in decommissioning timing and cost assumptions.  
 On December 7, 2016, Illinois FEJA was signed into law by the Governor of Illinois and included a ZES that provides compensation through the
procurement of ZECs targeted at preserving the environmental attributes of  zero-emissions  nuclear-powered generating facilities that meet specific eligibility criteria, much like the solution implemented with
the New York CES. The Illinois ZES will have a  10-year  duration extending from June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2027. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional discussion on the Illinois FEJA and
the ZES.    With the passage of the Illinois ZES, and subject to prevailing over any related potential administrative or legal challenges, in December
2016 Generation reversed its June 2016 decision to  
      399  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
permanently cease generation operations at the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear generating plants. Accordingly, in December 2016 Exelon and Generation reversed approximately $120 million of
the  one-time  charges initially recorded in June 2016 associated with the early retirements primarily for employee-related costs and a materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustment. In addition,
Generation updated the expected economic useful life for both facilities, to 2027 for Clinton, commensurate with the end of the Illinois ZES, and to 2032 for Quad Cities, the end of its current operating license. Depreciation was therefore adjusted
beginning December 7, 2016, to reflect these extended useful life estimates. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional detail on changes to the Nuclear decommissioning ARO balances resulting from the initial decision and
subsequent reversal of the decision to early retire Clinton and Quad Cities.    Through December 31, 2016, Exelon s and Generation s
results include a net incremental $688 million of  pre-tax  expense associated with the initial early retirement decision for Clinton and Quad Cities, as summarized in the table below.

 For Quad Cities based on the regulatory agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission, decommissioning-related activities are offset within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income. The offset results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to ComEd at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at ComEd. Likewise, ComEd has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from
Generation and corresponding regulatory liability.      In New York, the Ginna and Nine Mile Point nuclear plants continue to face
significant economic challenges and risk of retirement before the end of each unit s respective operating license period (2029 for Ginna and Nine Mile Point Unit 1, and 2046 for Nine Mile Point Unit 2). On August 1, 2016, the NYPSC issued
an order adopting the CES, which would provide payments to Ginna and Nine Mile Point for the environmental attributes of their production. On November 18, 2016 Ginna and Nine Mile Point executed the necessary contracts with NYSERDA, as required
under the CES. Subject to prevailing over any administrative or legal challenges, the CES will allow Ginna and Nine Mile Point to continue to operate at least through the life of the program (March 31, 2029). The assumed useful life for depreciation
purposes is through the end of their current operating licenses. The approved RSSA currently requires Ginna to continue operating through the RSSA term expiring on March 31, 2017 and required notification to the NYPSC if Ginna did not plan to
retire shortly after the expiration of the RSSA. On September 30, 2016, Ginna filed the required notice with the NYPSC of its intent to continue operating beyond the expiry of the RSSA. Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional
discussion on the Ginna RSSA and the New York CES.    Assuming the successful implementation of the Illinois ZES and the New York CES and the
continued effectiveness of these programs, Generation and CENG, through its ownership of Ginna and  
      400

Nine Mile Point, no longer consider Clinton, Quad Cities, Ginna or Nine Mile Point to be at heightened risk for early retirement. However, to the extent either the Illinois ZES or the New York
CES programs do not operate as expected over their full terms, each of these plants could again be at heightened risk for early retirement, which could have a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s future results of operations, cash
flows and financial position.    The Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear plant also did not clear in the May 2016 PJM capacity auction for the 2019-2020
planning year and will not receive capacity revenue for that period. This is the second consecutive year that TMI failed to clear the capacity auction. Although the plant is committed to operate through May 2019, the plant faces continued economic
challenges and Exelon and Generation are exploring all options to return it to profitability. While a portion of the Byron nuclear plant s capacity did not clear the PJM 2019-2020 planning year capacity auction, the plant is committed to run
through May 2020. The Company s other nuclear plants in PJM cleared in the auction, except Oyster Creek, which did not participate in the auction given Exelon s and Generation s previous commitment to cease operation of the Oyster
Creek nuclear plant by the end of 2019.    The following table provides the balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2016 for significant assets
and liabilities associated with TMI currently considered by management to be at the greatest risk of early retirement due to current economic valuations and other factors.

   The precise timing of an early retirement date for any nuclear plant, and the resulting financial statement impacts, may
be affected by a number of factors, including the status of potential regulatory or legislative solutions, results of any transmission system reliability study assessments, the nature of any  co-owner 
requirements and stipulations, and decommissioning trust fund requirements, among other factors. However, the earliest retirement date for any plant would usually be the first year in which the unit does not have capacity or other obligations, where
applicable, and just prior to its next scheduled nuclear refueling outage.

     10. Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant (Exelon, Generation, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL
and ACE)     Exelon s, Generation s, PECO s, BGE s, PHI s and ACE s undivided ownership interests in jointly owned
electric plants and transmission facilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      

(a) 
 Generation also owns a proportionate share in the fossil fuel combustion turbine at Salem, which is fully depreciated. The gross book value was $3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015.    

(d) 
 Generation, DPL and ACE own a 44.24%, 4.83% and 11.91% share, respectively in assets located at Merrill Creek Reservoir located in New Jersey. Pepco, DPL and ACE own a 11.9%, 7.4% and 6.6% share, respectively, in Valley
Forge Corporate Center.    

(e) 
 Excludes asset retirement costs.      Exelon s, Generation s, PECO s, BGE s,
Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s undivided ownership interests are financed with their funds and all operations are accounted for as if such participating interests were wholly-owned facilities. Exelon s, Generation s, PECO s,
BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s share of direct expenses of the jointly owned plants are included in Purchased power and fuel and Operating and maintenance expenses on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income and in Operating and maintenance expenses on PECO s, BGE s, Pepco, DPL s and ACE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

     11. Intangible Assets (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)
     Goodwill     Exelon s, Generation s,
ComEd s, PHI s, and DPL s gross amount of goodwill, accumulated impairment losses and carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

(a) 
 Reflects goodwill recorded in 2000 from the PECO/Unicom (predecessor parent company of ComEd) merger net of amortization, resolution of tax matters and other
 non-impairment-related  changes as allowed under previous authoritative guidance.    

(b) 
 Represents various measurement period adjustments to the valuation of the fair value of the PHI assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the merger.

  Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually, or more
frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PHI and DPL reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under the authoritative guidance for goodwill, a
reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a
business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Generation s operating segments are  Mid-Atlantic,  Midwest, New
England, New York, ERCOT and all other power regions referred to collectively as  Other Power Regions , PHI s operating segments are Pepco, DPL and ACE, and ComEd and DPL have a single operating segment. See Note 26 Segment
Information for additional information. There is no level below these operating segments for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, the ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE operating segments are also considered
reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Exelon s and ComEd s $2.6 billion of goodwill has been assigned entirely to the ComEd reporting unit, while Exelon s and PHI s $4 billion of goodwill has been assigned to
the Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units in the amounts of $1.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. DPL s $8 million of goodwill is assigned entirely to the DPL reporting unit.  
 Entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment
is necessary. In performing a qualitative assessment, entities should assess, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, cost factors and entity-specific events. If an entity
determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, no further testing is required.  
 If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment, but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair
value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative  two-step,  fair value-based test is performed. Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s, PHI s and DPL s accounting policy is to perform a
quantitative test of goodwill at least once every three years. The first step in the quantitative test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its
fair value, the second step is performed. The second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If
the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense.  
 Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value
of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility
sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for Generation s, ComEd s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s businesses and the fair value of debt. In applying the second step (if needed),
management must estimate the fair value of specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.      2016 and 2015 Goodwill Impairment
Assessment.   Generation performed a qualitative test as of November 1, 2016, for its 2016 annual goodwill impairment assessment. Generation previously completed its last quantitative assessment in the first quarter of 2015, and updated
its qualitative assessment as of November 1, 2015. Based on the qualitative factors above, Generation concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, and no further testing was
required.

  Exelon, ComEd, PHI, and DPL performed quantitative tests as of November 1, 2016, for their 2016
annual goodwill impairment assessments. The first step of the tests comparing the estimated fair values of the ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE reporting units to their carrying values, including goodwill, indicated no impairments of goodwill; therefore,
no second steps were required.    While the annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used to estimate reporting unit fair
values are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon s, ComEd s, PHI s or DPL s goodwill, which could be material. Based
on the results of the annual goodwill test performed as of November 1, 2016, the estimated fair values of the ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units would have needed to decrease by more than 30%, 10%, 10% and 10%, respectively, for Exelon,
ComEd and PHI to fail the first step of their respective impairment tests. The $8 million of goodwill recorded at DPL is related to DPL s 1995 acquisition of the Conowingo Power Company and the fair value of the DPL reporting unit would
have needed to decrease by more than 50% for DPL to fail the first step of the impairment test.    As of November 1, 2015, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI
qualitatively determined that the fair value of their reporting units was not more likely than not less than their carrying value and, therefore, did not perform quantitative assessments. As part of their qualitative assessments, Exelon, ComEd
and PHI evaluated, among other things, management s best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their respective business, as well as, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility
peer company EBITDA multiples, while also considering, the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments.

(b) 
 Includes unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Excludes $10 million of other miscellaneous unamortized energy contracts that have
been acquired at various points in time. The estimated amortization for these miscellaneous unamortized energy contracts is $(9) million, $(7) million, $(6) million, $(2) million and $4 million for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

(c) 
 In December 2010, Generation acquired all of the equity interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC (later named Exelon Wind), adding 735 MWs of installed, operating wind capacity located in eight states.    

(d) 
 In September 2011, Generation acquired all of the interest in Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One, a 242 MW solar project in northern Los Angeles County, CA from First Solar, Inc.    

(e) 
 On March 12, 2012, Constellation merged into Exelon with Exelon continuing as the surviving corporation pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger. Since the merger transaction,
Generation includes the former Constellation generation and customer supply operations.    

(f) 
 See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for additional information.    

(g) 
 On November 1, 2014, Generation acquired the competitive retail electric and natural gas business activities of Integrys Energy Group, Inc.    

(h) 
 See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information.    

(i) 
 Excludes $11 million of other miscellaneous customer relationships that have been acquired. The estimated amortization for these miscellaneous customer relationships is $1 million in each of the years from
2017 to 2021.    

(j) 
 In March 1999, ComEd entered into a settlement agreement with the City of Chicago associated with ComEd s franchise agreement. Under the terms of the settlement, ComEd agreed to make payments to the City of Chicago
each year from 1999 to 2002. The intangible asset recognized as a result of these payments is being amortized ratably over the remaining term of the franchise agreement, which ends in 2020.    

(k) 
 In February 2003, ComEd entered into separate agreements with the City of Chicago and with Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest Generation). Under the terms of the settlement agreement with the City of Chicago, ComEd agreed
to pay the City of Chicago a total of $60 million over a  ten-year  period, beginning in 2003. The intangible asset recognized as a result of the settlement agreement is being amortized ratably over the
remaining term of the City of Chicago franchise agreement, which ends in 2020. As required by the settlement, ComEd also made a payment of $2 million to a third-party on the City of Chicago s behalf. Under the terms of the agreement with
Midwest Generation, ComEd received payments of $32 million from Midwest Generation to relieve Midwest Generation s obligation under the 1999 fossil sale agreement with ComEd to build the generation facility in the City of Chicago. The
payments received by ComEd, which have been recorded in Other deferred credits and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on Exelon s and ComEd s Consolidated Balance Sheets are being recognized ratably (approximately
$2 million annually) as an offset to amortization expense over the remaining term of the franchise agreement.    

(l) 
 Weighted-average amortization period was calculated at the date of a) acquisition for acquired assets or b) settlement agreement.    

(m) 
 In the third quarter of 2015, Pepco entered into a sponsorship agreement with the District of Columbia for future naming rights associated with public property within the District of Columbia to be determined over time
through future negotiations. Amortization of the intangible asset will begin once the terms of the naming rights are defined.      The
following table summarizes the amortization expense related to intangible assets and liabilities for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:      

(a) 
 At Exelon, amortization of unamortized energy contracts totaling $35 million, $22 million and $135 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was recorded in
Operating revenues or Purchase power and fuel expense within Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. At Generation, amortization of unamortized energy contracts totaling $35 million, $22 million and
$135 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was recorded in Operating revenues or Purchase power and fuel expense within Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income

    Acquired Intangible Assets and Liabilities    
 Accounting guidance for business combinations requires the acquirer to separately recognize identifiable intangible assets in the application of purchase
accounting.     Unamortized Energy Contracts.  Unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized fair value
of  non-derivative  energy contracts that Exelon and Generation have acquired. The valuation of unamortized energy contracts was estimated by applying either the market approach or the income approach depending
on the nature of the underlying contract. The market approach was utilized when prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable transactions were available. Otherwise, the income approach, which is based
upon discounted projected future cash flows associated with the underlying contracts, was utilized. The fair value is based upon certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key
estimates and inputs include forecasted power and fuel prices and the discount rate. The Exelon Wind unamortized energy contracts are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which the associated contract revenues are recognized as a
decrease in Operating revenues within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. In the case of Antelope Valley, Constellation, CENG, Integrys and ConEdison, the fair value amounts are
amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the present value of the underlying cash flows as of the acquisition dates through either Operating revenues or Purchase power and fuel expense within Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. At PHI, offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities were also recorded. The unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities and any corresponding regulatory assets or liabilities,
respectively, are amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows.     Customer
Relationships.  The customer relationship intangibles were determined based on a  multi-period excess method  of the income approach. Under this method, the intangible asset s fair value is determined to be the estimated
future cash flows that will be earned on the current customer base, taking into account expected contract renewals based on customer attrition rates and costs to retain those customers. The fair value is based upon certain unobservable inputs,
which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key assumptions include the customer attrition rate and the discount rate. The accounting guidance requires that customer-based intangibles be amortized
over the period expected to be benefited using the pattern of economic benefit. The amortization of the customer relationships recorded in Depreciation and amortization expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income.     Service Contract Backlog.  The service contract backlog intangibles were determined based on a
 multi-period excess method  of the income approach. Under this method, the intangible asset s fair value is determined to be the estimated future cash flows that will be earned on the contracts. The fair value is based upon
certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key assumptions include estimated revenues and expenses to complete the contracts as well as the discount rate. The accounting
guidance requires that customer-based intangibles be amortized over the period expected to be benefited using the pattern of economic benefit. The amortization of the service contract backlog is recorded in Depreciation and amortization
expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.     Trade Name.  The
Constellation trade name intangible was determined based on the relief from royalty method of income approach whereby fair value is determined to be the present value of the  
      408

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
license fees avoided by owning the assets. The fair value is based upon certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key
assumptions include the hypothetical royalty rate and the discount rate. The Constellation trade name intangible is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years. The amortization of the trade name is recorded in Depreciation and
amortization expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.      Renewable
Energy Credits and Alternative Energy Credits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, DPL and ACE)      Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s,
PECO s, DPL s and ACE s other intangible assets, included in Other current assets and Other deferred debits and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, include RECs (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, DPL and ACE) and AECs (Exelon
and PECO). Purchased RECs are recorded at cost on the date they are purchased. The cost of RECs purchased on a stand-alone basis is based on the transaction price, while the cost of RECs acquired through PPAs represents the difference between the
total contract price and the market price of energy at contract inception. Generally, revenue for RECs that are part of a bundled power sale is recognized when the power is produced and delivered to the customer, otherwise, the revenue is recognized
upon physical transfer of the REC. As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, PECO had current AECs of $1 million and $2 million, respectively. PECO had no noncurrent AECs as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016,
and 2015, Generation had current RECs of $317 million and $251 million, respectively, and $29 million and $56 million of noncurrent REC s, respectively. ComEd had no current RECs as of December 31, 2016 and
$5 million as of December 31, 2015. ComEd had no noncurrent RECs as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, DPL had current RECs of $11 million and $9 million, respectively. DPL had no
noncurrent RECs as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, ACE had current RECs of $1 million. ACE had no noncurrent RECs as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note
24 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on RECs and AECs.       12. Fair Value of Financial Assets and
Liabilities (All Registrants)       Fair Value of Financial Liabilities Recorded at the Carrying Amount    
 The following tables present the carrying amounts and fair values of the Registrants  short-term liabilities, long-term debt, SNF obligation, and

(b) 
 Includes unamortized debt issuance costs which are not fair valued of $7 million, $1 million and $6 million for Exelon, ComEd and BGE, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015.       Short-Term Liabilities.  The short-term liabilities included in the tables above are comprised of dividends payable
(included in other current liabilities) (Level 1) and short-term borrowings (Level 2). The Registrants  carrying amounts of the short-term liabilities are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  
  Long-Term Debt.  The fair value amounts of Exelon s taxable debt securities (Level 2) and private placement taxable debt securities
(Level 3) are determined by a valuation model that is based on a conventional discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves. In order to incorporate the credit risk of the Registrants into the discount
rates, Exelon obtains pricing (i.e., U.S. Treasury rate plus credit spread) based on trades of existing Exelon debt securities as well as debt securities of other issuers in the utility sector with similar credit ratings in both the primary and
secondary market, across the Registrants  debt maturity spectrum. The credit spreads of various tenors obtained from this information are added to the appropriate benchmark U.S. Treasury rates in order to determine the current market yields for
the various tenors. The yields are then converted into discount rates of various tenors that are used for discounting the respective cash flows of the same tenor for each bond or note. Due to low trading volume of private placement debt,
 
      412  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
qualitative factors such as market conditions, low volume of investors and investor demand, this debt is classified as Level 3. The fair value of Exelon s equity units (Level 1) are
valued based on publicly traded securities issued by Exelon.    The fair value of Generation s, Pepco s and PHI s  non-government-backed  fixed rate nonrecourse debt (Level 3) is based on market and quoted prices for its own and other nonrecourse debt with similar risk profiles. Given the low trading volume in the nonrecourse
debt market, the price quotes used to determine fair value will reflect certain qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, new developments that might significantly impact the project cash flows or  off-taker  credit, and other circumstances related to the project (e.g., political and regulatory environment). The fair value of Generation s government-backed fixed rate project financing debt (Level 3) is
largely based on a discounted cash flow methodology that is similar to the taxable debt securities methodology described above. Due to the lack of market trading data on similar debt, the discount rates are derived based on the original loan
interest rate spread to the applicable Treasury rate as well as a current market curve derived from government-backed securities. Variable rate project financing debt resets on a monthly or quarterly basis and the carrying value approximates fair
value (Level 2). When trading data is available on variable rate project financing debt, the fair value is based on market and quoted prices for its own and other nonrecourse debt with similar risk profiles (Level 2). Generation, Pepco, DPL and
ACE also have  tax-exempt  debt (Level 2). Due to low trading volume in this market, qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, and circumstances related to the issuer (e.g., conduit issuer
political and regulatory environment), may be incorporated into the credit spreads that are used to obtain the fair value as described above. Variable rate  tax-exempt  debt (Level 2) resets on a regular basis
and the carrying value approximates fair value.     SNF Obligation . The carrying amount of Generation s SNF obligation (Level 2) is derived
from a contract with the DOE to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation s nuclear generating stations. When determining the fair value of the obligation, the future carrying amount of the SNF obligation is calculated by compounding the
current book value of the SNF obligation at the  13-week  Treasury rate. The compounded obligation amount is discounted back to present value using Generation s discount rate, which is calculated using the
same methodology as described above for the taxable debt securities, and an estimated maturity date of 2030 and 2025 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information
regarding the change in estimated settlement date.     Long-Term Debt to Financing Trusts .   Exelon s long-term debt to financing
trusts is valued based on publicly traded securities issued by the financing trusts. Due to low trading volume of these securities, qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, and circumstances related to each issue, this debt
is classified as Level 3.     Preferred Stock .   The fair value of these securities is determined based on the carrying value of the
shares per the Subscription Agreement between PHI and Exelon. See Note 19 Mezzanine Equity for further details.      Recurring Fair Value
Measurements      Exelon records the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established by the authoritative
guidance for fair value measurements. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:      

Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to liquidate as of the reporting date.    
      413  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       

Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.

Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third-party valuations for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.    
 Transfers in and out of levels are recognized as of the end of the reporting period when the transfer occurred. Given derivatives categorized within
Level 1 are valued using exchange-based quoted prices within observable periods, transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 were not material. Additionally, there were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during
the year ended December 31, 2016 for cash equivalents, nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, pledged assets for Zion Station decommissioning, Rabbi trust investments, and deferred compensation obligations. For derivative contracts,
transfers into Level 2 from Level 3 generally occur when the contract tenor becomes more observable and due to changes in market liquidity or assumptions for certain commodity contracts.  
  Generation and Exelon     In accordance with the
applicable guidance on fair value measurement, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are no longer classified within the fair value hierarchy and are included under  Not subject to
leveling  in the table below. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.

   Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value    
 The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.  
  Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).  The Registrants  cash equivalents include investments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased. The cash equivalents shown in the fair value tables are comprised of investments in mutual and money market funds. The fair values of the shares of these funds are based on observable market prices
and, therefore, have been categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.     Preferred Stock Derivative (PHI).  In connection with
entering into the PHI Merger Agreement, as further described in Note 19 Mezzanine Equity, PHI entered into a Subscription Agreement with Exelon dated April 29, 2014, pursuant to which PHI issued to Exelon shares of Preferred stock. The
Preferred stock contained embedded features requiring separate accounting consideration to reflect the potential value to PHI that any issued and outstanding Preferred stock could be called and redeemed at a nominal par value upon a termination of
the merger agreement under certain circumstances due to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. The embedded call and redemption features on the shares of the Preferred stock in the event of such a termination were separately accounted
for as derivatives. These Preferred stock derivatives were valued quarterly using quantitative and qualitative factors, including management s assessment of the likelihood of a Regulatory Termination and therefore, were categorized in
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. As a result of the PHI Merger, the PHI Preferred stock derivative was reduced to zero as of March 23, 2016. The  write-off  was charged to Other, net on the PHI
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.     Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and Pledged Assets for Zion
Station Decommissioning (Exelon and Generation).  The trust fund investments have been established to satisfy Generation s and CENG s nuclear decommissioning obligations as required by the NRC. The NDT funds hold debt and equity
securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds and mutual funds, which are included in Equities, Fixed Income and Other. Generation s and CENG s NDT fund investments policies outline investment guidelines for the trusts and
limit the trust funds  exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets and other alternative investments. Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed income securities are
 
      425

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
considered cash equivalents and included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.  
 With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are generally obtained from direct
feeds from market exchanges, which Generation is able to independently corroborate. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds which are based on quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1. Certain
equity securities have been categorized as Level 2 because they are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities. Equity securities held individually are primarily
traded on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ-Global Select Market, which contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges.  
 For fixed income securities, multiple prices from pricing services are obtained whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition
to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each security. With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services
and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. Generation has
obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Generation selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other
market-based price sources. U.S. Treasury securities are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair values of fixed income securities, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, are based on evaluated
prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. The fair values of private placement fixed income securities, which
are included in Corporate debt, are determined using a third party valuation that contains significant unobservable inputs and are categorized in Level 3.  
 Equity and fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a
stated set of fund objectives such as holding short term fixed income securities or tracking the performance of certain equity indices by purchasing equity securities to replicate the capitalization and characteristics of the indices. The values of
some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For commingled funds and mutual funds, which are not
publicly quoted, the funds are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value, which is primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying securities, and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These
investments typically can be redeemed monthly with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.    Derivative instruments consisting
primarily of futures and interest rate swaps to manage risk are recorded at fair value. Over the counter derivatives are valued daily based on quoted prices in active markets and trade in open markets, and have been categorized as Level 1.
Derivative instruments other than over the counter derivatives are valued based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.  
 Middle market lending are investments in loans or managed funds which lend to private companies. Generation elected the fair value option for its
investments in certain limited partnerships  
      426  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
that invest in middle market lending managed funds. The fair value of these loans is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models.
Investments in loans are categorized as Level 3 because the fair value of these securities is based largely on inputs that are unobservable and utilize complex valuation models. Managed funds are valued using NAV or its equivalent as a
practical expedient, and therefore, are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Investments in middle market lending typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan.  
 Private equity and real estate investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies and real estate holding companies
that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange, such as, leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments, investments in natural resources, and direct investments in pools of real estate properties. The fair value of
private equity and real estate investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically cannot be redeemed and are generally
liquidated over a period of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date. Private equity and real estate valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost,
operating results, discounted future cash flows, market based comparable data, and independent appraisals from sources with professional qualifications. These valuation inputs are not highly observable.  
 As of December 31, 2016, Generation has outstanding commitments to invest in middle market lending, private equity investments and real estate
investments of approximately $284 million, $65 million, and $205 million, respectively. These commitments will be funded by Generation s existing nuclear decommissioning trust funds.  
  Concentrations of Credit Risk.  Generation evaluated its NDT portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of
December 31, 2016. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2016, there were no
significant concentrations (generally defined as greater than 10 percent) of risk in Generation s NDT assets.    See Note 16 Asset
Retirement Obligations for further discussion on the NDT fund investments.     Rabbi Trust Investments (Exelon, Generation, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco,
DPL and ACE).  The Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of Exelon s executive management and directors. The Rabbi trusts assets are included in
investments in the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of money market funds, mutual funds, fixed income securities and life insurance policies. The mutual funds are maintained by investment companies and hold certain
investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. Money market funds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear
observability of the prices. The fair values of fixed income securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are
categorized in Level 2. The life insurance policies are valued using the cash surrender value of the policies, net of loans against those policies, which is provided by a third-party. Certain life insurance policies, which consist primarily of
mutual funds that are priced based on observable market data, have been categorized as Level 2 because the life insurance policies can be liquidated at the reporting date for the value of the underlying assets. Life insurance policies that are
valued using unobservable inputs have been categorized as Level 3.

     Mark-to-Market  
Derivatives (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PHI and DPL) .   Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and  non-exchange-based  markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives  pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or   over-the-counter,    on-line  exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the
 bid-ask,   mid-point  prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed
and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points,
 bid-ask  spreads and contract duration. The remainder of derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an industry standard option valuation model. The Black model takes into account inputs such as
contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards,
swaps and options, model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. The Registrants  derivatives are predominately at liquid trading points. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited
pricing information model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. These valuations may include an estimated basis adjustment from an illiquid trading point to a liquid trading point for which active price quotations
are available. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3.    Exelon may utilize
  fixed-to-floating   interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent
of total debt. In addition, the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation of future financings. These interest rate derivatives are typically designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon determines
the current fair value by calculating the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement, based on and discounted by the market s expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value
calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk and other market parameters. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair
value hierarchy. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion on   mark-to-market   derivatives.  
  Deferred Compensation Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).    The Registrants  deferred
compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the
Registrants  deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants  notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are comprised primarily of equities, mutual funds, commingled funds, and
fixed income securities which are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy.    The value of certain employment agreement obligations (which are included with the Deferred Compensation Obligation in the tables above)
are based on a known and certain stream of payments to be made over time and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

    Additional Information Regarding Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PHI, Pepco and DPL)         Mark-to-Market   Derivatives (Exelon,
Generation and ComEd).  For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes
derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing
the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. Exelon s RMC approves
risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief executive officer and includes the chief risk
officer, chief strategy officer, chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief financial officer and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Exelon Board of
Directors on the scope of the risk management activities. Forward price curves for the power market utilized by the front office to manage the portfolio, are reviewed and verified by the middle office, and used for financial reporting by the back
office. The Registrants consider credit and nonperformance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of credit and nonperformance risk by
counterparty. Due to master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements, the impacts of credit and nonperformance risk were not material to the financial statements.  
 Disclosed below is detail surrounding the Registrants  significant Level 3 valuations. The calculated fair value includes marketability
discounts for margining provisions and other attributes. Generation s Level 3 balance generally consists of forward sales and purchases of power and natural gas and certain transmission congestion contracts. Generation utilizes various
inputs and factors including market data and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. The inputs and factors include
forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility, contractual volumes, delivery location, interest rates, credit quality of counterparties and credit enhancements.  
 For commodity derivatives, the primary input to the valuation models is the forward commodity price curve for each instrument. Forward commodity price
curves are derived by risk management for liquid locations and by the traders and portfolio managers for illiquid locations. All locations are reviewed and verified by risk management considering published exchange transaction prices, executed
bilateral transactions, broker quotes, and other observable or public data sources. The relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivatives depends on a number of factors, including commodity type, delivery location, and delivery
period. Price volatility varies by commodity and location. When appropriate, Generation discounts future cash flows using risk free interest rates with adjustments to reflect the credit quality of each counterparty for assets and Generation s
own credit quality for liabilities. The level of observability of a forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period. Certain delivery locations including PJM West Hub (for power) and Henry Hub (for natural
gas) are more liquid and prices are observable for up to three years in the future. The observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option valuations. The forward curve for a less liquid location
is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying a spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location. This spread does not typically represent a majority of the instrument s market
price. As a result, the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid  
      429  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
market movements and not a change in the applied spread. The change in fair value associated with a change in the spread is generally immaterial. An average spread calculated across all
Level 3 power and gas delivery locations is approximately $2.65 and $0.34 for power and natural gas, respectively. Many of the commodity derivatives are short term in nature and thus a majority of the fair value may be based on observable
inputs even though the contract as a whole must be classified as Level 3.    On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several  20-year  floating to fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for more
information. The fair value of these swaps has been designated as a Level 3 valuation due to the long tenure of the positions and internal modeling assumptions. The modeling assumptions include using natural gas heat rates to project long term
forward power curves adjusted by a renewable factor that incorporates time of day and seasonality factors to reflect accurate renewable energy pricing. In addition, marketability reserves are applied to the positions based on the tenor and supplier
risk.    The table below discloses the significant inputs to the forward curve used to value these positions.

 The inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted. The significant unobservable
inputs used in the fair value measurement of Generation s commodity derivatives are forward commodity prices and for options is price volatility. Increases (decreases) in the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly
higher (lower) fair values for long positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or option to purchase a commodity), with offsetting impacts to short positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or right to sell a commodity).
Increases (decreases) in volatility would increase (decrease) the value for the holder of the option (writer of the option). Generally, a change in the estimate of forward commodity prices is unrelated to a change in the estimate of volatility of
prices. An increase to the reserves listed above would decrease the fair value of the positions. An increase to the heat rate or renewable factors would increase the fair value accordingly. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices
of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.     Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and Pledged Assets for Zion Station   Decommissioning (Exelon and Generation).  For middle market lending and certain corporate debt securities investments, the fair value is determined using a
combination of valuation models including cost models, market models and income models. The valuation estimates are based on discounting the forecasted cash flows, market-based comparable data, credit and liquidity factors, as well as other
factors that may impact value. Significant judgment is required in the application of discounts or premiums applied for factors such as size, marketability, credit risk and relative performance.  
 Because Generation relies on third-party fund managers to develop the quantitative unobservable inputs without adjustment for the valuations of its
Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Generation. This includes information regarding the sensitivity of the fair values to changes
in the unobservable inputs. Generation gains an understanding of the fund managers  inputs and assumptions used in preparing the valuations. Generation performed procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations.

   Rabbi Trust Investments Life insurance contracts (Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)  For 
 life insurance policies categorized as Level 3, the fair value is determined based on the cash surrender value of the policy, which contains unobservable inputs and assumptions. Because Exelon relies on its third-party insurance provider to
develop the inputs without adjustment for the valuations of its Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Exelon. Exelon gains an
understanding of the types of inputs and assumptions used in preparing the valuations and performs procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations.      
 13. Derivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants)     The Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, foreign
currency exchange risk and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations.      Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants)    
 To the extent the amount of energy Generation produces differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon and Generation are exposed to
market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, fossil fuels and other commodities. Each of the Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices by entering into
physical and financial derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, options and short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products. The Registrants believe these instruments, which are
classified as either economic hedges or  non-derivatives,  mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.  
 Derivative accounting guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair
value of the derivative recognized in earnings each period. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing
basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include normal purchase normal sale (NPNS), cash flow hedge and fair value hedge. For Generation, all derivative economic hedges related to commodities are recorded at fair value through
earnings for the combined company, referred to as economic hedges in the following tables. The Registrants have applied the NPNS scope exception to certain derivative contracts for the forward sale of generation, power procurement agreements, and
natural gas supply agreements. Generation has also entered into bilateral long-term contractual obligations for sales of energy to load-serving entities, including electric utilities, municipalities, electric cooperatives and retail load
aggregators, as well as contractual obligations to deliver energy to market participants who primarily focus on the resale of energy products for delivery. These  non-derivative  contracts are accounted for
primarily under the accrual method of accounting. Additionally, Generation is exposed to certain market risks through its proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities are a complement to Generation s energy marketing
portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s overall energy marketing activities.     Economic Hedging.  The Registrants are
exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, fossil fuels, and other commodities associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather
conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. Within Exelon, Generation has the most exposure to commodity price risk. As such, Generation uses a variety of derivative and
 non-derivative  instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation  
      432

facilities, including power and gas sales, fuel and energy purchases, natural gas transportation and pipeline capacity agreements and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. In
order to manage these risks, Generation may enter into fixed-price derivative or  non-derivative  contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of energy and gas and purchases of
fuel and energy. The objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on electric generation operations, fixing the price of a
portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of power plants, and fixing the price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply load-serving customers. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon
management s policies and hedging objectives, the market, weather conditions, operational and other factors. Generation is also exposed to differences between the locational settlement prices of certain economic hedges and the hedged generating
units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which include derivative congestion products, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights, which are accounted for on an
accrual basis.    In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation s
owned and contracted generation positions that have not been hedged. Generation hedges commodity price risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of December 31, 2016, the proportion of expected generation hedged for the major
reportable segments was 91%-94%, 56%-59% and 28%-31% for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of
energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generating facilities based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market
quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain  non-derivative  contracts, including Generation s
sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load.    On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several
 20-year    floating-to-fixed   energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and
associated RECs. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012. These contracts are designed to lock in a portion of the long-term commodity price risk resulting from the renewable energy resource procurement requirements in the Illinois
Settlement Legislation. ComEd has not elected hedge accounting for these derivative financial instruments. ComEd records the fair value of the swap contracts on its balance sheet. Because ComEd receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and
related costs from retail customers, the change in fair value each period is recorded by ComEd as a regulatory asset or liability. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.  
 PECO has contracts to procure electric supply that were executed through the competitive procurement process outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP
Programs, which are further discussed in Note 3 Regulatory Matters. Based on Pennsylvania legislation and the DSP Programs permitting PECO to recover its electric supply procurement costs from retail customers with no  mark-up,  PECO s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. PECO locked in fixed prices for a significant portion of its commodity price risk through full requirements contracts. PECO has
certain full requirements contracts that are considered derivatives and qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance.  
 PECO s natural gas procurement policy is designed to achieve a reasonable balance of long-term and short-term gas purchases under different pricing
approaches in order to achieve system supply  
      433

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
reliability at the least cost. PECO s reliability strategy is  two-fold.  First, PECO must assure that there is sufficient transportation capacity to
satisfy delivery requirements. Second, PECO must ensure that a firm source of supply exists to utilize the capacity resources. All of PECO s natural gas supply and asset management agreements that are derivatives either qualify for the NPNS
scope exception and have been designated as such, or have no   mark-to-market   balances because the derivatives are index priced. Additionally, in accordance with the 2016
PAPUC PGC settlement and to reduce the exposure of PECO and its customers to natural gas price volatility, PECO has continued its program to purchase natural gas for both winter and summer supplies using a layered approach of  locking-in  prices ahead of each season with long-term gas purchase agreements (those with primary terms of at least twelve months). Under the terms of the 2016 PGC settlement, PECO is required to lock in (i.e.,
economically hedge) the price of a minimum volume of its long-term gas commodity purchases. PECO s  gas-hedging  program is designed to cover about 25% of planned natural gas purchases in support of
projected firm sales. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on PECO s financial position or results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.  
 BGE has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC. The SOS rates
charged recover BGE s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee. The administrative fee includes an incremental cost component and a shareholder return component for commercial and industrial rate classes. BGE s
price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. BGE locks in fixed prices for all of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of BGE s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify
for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other BGE full requirements contracts are not derivatives.    BGE
provides natural gas to its customers under a MBR mechanism approved by the MDPSC. Under this mechanism, BGE s actual cost of gas is compared to a market index (a measure of the market price of gas in a given period). The difference between
BGE s actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers. BGE must also secure fixed price contracts for at least 10%, but not more than 20%, of forecasted system supply requirements for flowing (i.e.  non-storage)  gas for the November through March period. These fixed-price contracts are not subject to sharing under the MBR mechanism. BGE also ensures it has sufficient pipeline transportation capacity to meet
customer requirements. All of BGE s natural gas supply and asset management agreements qualify for the NPNS scope exception and result in physical delivery.  
 Pepco has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and DCPSC. The SOS
rates charged recover Pepco s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee. The administrative fee includes an incremental cost component and a shareholder return component for residential and commercial rate classes.
Pepco s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. Pepco locks in fixed prices for all of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of Pepco s full requirements contracts, which are considered
derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other Pepco full requirements contracts are not derivatives.  
 DPL has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and the DPSC. The SOS
rates charged recover DPL s wholesale power supply costs. In Delaware, DPL is also entitled to recover a Reasonable Allowance for Retail Margin (RARM). The RARM includes a fixed annual margin of approximately $2.75 million, plus an
incremental cost component and a cash working capital allowance. In Maryland, DPL charges an administrative fee intended to allow it to recover its administrative costs. DPL locks in fixed prices  
      434

for all of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. DPL s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. Certain of DPL s full requirements contracts,
which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other DPL full requirements contracts are not derivatives.  
 DPL provides natural gas to its customers under an Annual GCR mechanism approved by the DPSC. Under this mechanism, DPL s Annual GCR Filing
establishes a future GCR for firm bundled sales customers by using a forecast of demand and commodity costs. The actual costs are trued up versus the forecast on a monthly basis and any shortfall or excess is carried forward as a recovery balance in
the next GCR filing. The demand portion of the GCR is based upon DPL s firm transportation and storage contracts. DPL has firm deliverability of swing and seasonal storage; a liquefied natural gas facility and firm transportation capacity to
meet customer demand and provide a reserve margin. The commodity portion of the GCR includes a commission approved hedging program which is intended to reduce gas commodity price volatility while limiting the firm natural gas customers 
exposure to adverse changes in the market price of natural gas. The hedge program requires that DPL hedge, on a  non-discretionary  basis, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of estimated purchase
requirements for each month, including estimated monthly purchases for storage injections. The fifty percent (50%) hedge monthly target is achieved by hedging 1/12th of the 50% target each month beginning
 12-months  prior to the month in which the physical gas is to be purchased. Currently, DPL uses only exchange traded futures for its Gas Hedging Program, which are considered derivatives, however, it retains
the capability to employ other physical and financial hedges if needed. DPL has not elected hedge accounting for these derivative financial instruments. Because of the DPSC-approved fuel adjustment clause for DPL s derivatives, the change in
fair value of the derivatives each period, in addition to all premiums paid and other transaction costs incurred as part of the Gas Hedging Program, are fully recoverable and are recorded by DPL as regulatory assets or liabilities. DPL s
physical gas purchases are currently all daily, monthly or intra-month transactions. From time to time, DPL will enter into seasonal purchase or sale arrangements, however, there are none currently in the portfolio. Certain of DPL s full
requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other DPL full requirements contracts are not derivatives.  
 ACE has contracts to procure BGS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. The BGS rates
charged recover ACE s wholesale power supply costs. ACE does not make any profit or incur any loss on the supply component of the BGS it supplies to customers. ACE s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. ACE locks
in fixed prices for all of its BGS requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of ACE s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative
guidance. Other ACE full requirements contracts are not derivatives.     Proprietary Trading.  Generation also enters into certain
energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those entered into with the intent of hedging or
managing risk. Proprietary trading activities are subject to limits established by Exelon s RMC. The proprietary trading activities, which included settled physical sales volumes of 6,179 GWh, 7,310 GWh and 10,571 GWh for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s revenue from energy marketing activities. ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE do not
enter into derivatives for proprietary trading purposes.

    Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE and PHI)
     The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants utilize   fixed-to-floating   interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest rate exposure. In addition, the Registrants may
utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. These strategies are employed to manage interest rate risks. At December 31, 2016, Exelon had
$800 million of notional amounts of   fixed-to-floating   hedges outstanding and Exelon and Generation had $659 million of notional amounts of   floating-to-fixed   hedges outstanding. Assuming the fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges are 100% effective, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in the interest rates
associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and   fixed-to-floating   swaps would result in an approximately $7 million decrease in Exelon
Consolidated  pre-tax  income for the year ended December 31, 2016. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international commodity purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars,
Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. Below is a summary of the interest rate and foreign exchange hedge balances as of December 31, 2016:  

(a) 
 Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions. The characterization of the interest rate derivative contracts
between the proprietary trading activity in the above table is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that gives rise to the interest rate exposure. Generation does not utilize proprietary trading interest
rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or changes in market interest rates.    

(b) 
 Exelon and Generation net all available amounts allowed under the derivative accounting guidance on the balance sheet. These amounts include unrealized derivative transactions with the same counterparty under legally
enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. In some cases Exelon and Generation may have other offsetting exposures subject to a master netting or similar agreement, such as accrued interest, transactions that do not qualify as
derivatives, letters of credit and other forms of  non-cash  collateral. These are not reflected in the table above.

   Fair Value Hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value
hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. Exelon includes the gain or loss on the hedged items and the offsetting loss or
gain on the related interest rate swaps in interest expense as follows:      

(a) 
 For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the loss on Generation swaps included $(1) million and $(17) million realized in earnings, respectively, with an immaterial amount and $4 million excluded from
hedge effectiveness testing, respectively.      At December 31, 2016, Exelon had total outstanding   fixed-to-floating   fair value hedges related to interest rate swaps of $800 million, with a derivative asset of $16 million. At December 31, 2015, Exelon had outstanding   fixed-to-floating   fair value hedges related to interest rate swaps of $800 million, with a derivative asset of $25 million. During the years ended December 31,
2016 and 2015, the impact on the results of operations as a result of ineffectiveness from fair value hedges was a $14 million gain and $17 million gain, respectively.  
  Cash Flow Hedges . During the second quarter of 2016, Exelon entered into $90 million of   floating-to-fixed   forward starting interest rate swaps to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure associated with an anticipated debt issuance. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon
terminated the swaps during the third quarter of 2016 upon issuance of the debt. Exelon did not recognize a gain or loss as a result of the termination.  
 During the first and second quarter of 2016, Exelon entered into $600 million and $100 million of   floating-to-fixed   forward starting interest rate swaps, respectively, to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure associated with an anticipated debt issuance. The swaps were designated as cash flow
hedges. Exelon terminated the swaps during the second quarter of 2016 upon issuance of the debt. Exelon recognized a loss of $3 million related to the swaps and $3 million of AOCI will be amortized into Other, net in Exelon s
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income over the term of the debt. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
 During the first quarter of 2016, Exelon entered into a $100 million
  floating-to-fixed   forward starting interest rate swaps to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure associated with an anticipated debt issuance. The swap was
designated as a cash flow hedge. Exelon terminated the swap during the first quarter of 2016 upon issuance of the debt. Exelon did not recognize a gain or loss as a result of the termination of the swap and an immaterial amount of AOCI will be
amortized into Other, net in Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income over the term of the debt.    During the
third quarter of 2014, EGTP, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into a   floating-to-fixed   interest rate swap to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in
connection with the long-term borrowing. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information regarding the financing. The swaps have a notional amount of $495 million as of December 31, 2016 and expire in 2019. The swap
was designated as a cash flow hedge in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2016, the subsidiary had a $9 million derivative liability related to the swap.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  During the first quarter of 2014, EGR, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into   floating-to-fixed   interest rate swaps to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with the long-term borrowings. See Note 14 Debt and Credit
Agreements for additional information regarding the financing. The swaps have a notional amount of $164 million as of December 31, 2016 and expire in 2020. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2016, the
subsidiary had a $1 million derivative liability related to the swaps.    During the second quarter of 2002, PHI entered into treasury rate lock
transactions in anticipation of the issuance of several series of fixed-rate debt commencing in August 2002 to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure. Upon issuance of the fixed-rate debt in August 2002, the treasury rate locks were
terminated at a loss and the loss was deferred in AOCI. As a result of the PHI Merger, the remaining unamortized deferred loss recorded in AOCI was adjusted to zero through application of purchase accounting.  
 During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the impact on the results of operations as a result of ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges in
continuing designated hedge relationships was immaterial.     Economic Hedges.    During the third quarter of 2011, Sacramento PV
Energy, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into   floating-to-fixed   interest rate swaps to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with the long-term
borrowings. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information regarding the financing. During the first quarter of 2016, upon the termination of debt, Generation terminated the swaps. The total notional amount of the swaps were
$25 million. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the termination of the swaps.    During the third quarter of 2012, Constellation Solar
Horizons, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into a   floating-to-fixed   interest rate swap to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with the
long-term borrowings. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information regarding the financing. During the first quarter of 2016, upon the termination of debt, Generation terminated the swap. The total notional amount of the
swap was $24 million. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the termination of the swap.    During the second quarter 2015, upon the
issuance of debt, Exelon terminated $2,400 million of   floating-to-fixed   forward starting interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination of the swaps, Exelon
realized a $64 million loss during the second quarter of 2015.    At December 31, 2016, Generation had no notional amounts of interest rate
derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions and $85 million in notional amounts of foreign currency exchange rate swaps that are   marked-to-market   to manage the exposure associated with international purchases of commodities in currencies other than U.S. dollars.  
   Fair Value Measurement and Accounting for the Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts (Exelon Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI and
DPL)      Fair value accounting guidance and disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities requires the fair value of derivative
instruments to be shown in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. A master

netting agreement is an agreement between two counterparties that may have derivative and  non-derivative  contracts with each other providing for the net
settlement of all referencing contracts via one payment stream, which takes place as the contracts deliver, when collateral is requested or in the event of default. Generation s use of cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless Generation
is downgraded below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ or Ba1). In the table below, Generation s energy related economic hedges and proprietary trading derivatives are shown gross. The impact of the netting of fair value balances with the same
counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral including initial margin on exchange positions, is aggregated in the collateral and netting column. As of December 31, 2016
and 2015, $8 million of cash collateral held and $3 million of cash collateral posted, respectively, was not offset against derivative positions because such collateral was not associated with any energy-related derivatives, were
associated with accrual positions, or as of the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. Excluded from the tables below are economic hedges that qualify for the NPNS scope exception and other
 non-derivative  contracts that are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting.    ComEd s use of
cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless ComEd is downgraded below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ or Ba1).    Cash collateral held by PECO and
BGE must be deposited in a non affiliate major U.S. commercial bank or foreign bank with a U.S. branch office that meet certain qualifications.    In
the table below, DPL s economic hedges are shown gross. The impact of the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral, is
aggregated in the collateral and netting column.

on  pre-tax  earnings based on the reclassification adjustment from OCI to earnings was a $2 million and $195 million  pre-tax  gain, respectively. Neither Exelon
nor Generation will incur changes in cash flow hedge ineffectiveness in future periods relating to energy-related hedges positions as all were  de-designated  prior to the Constellation merger date.  
  Economic Hedges (Exelon and Generation).  These instruments represent hedges that economically mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity
prices and include financial options, futures, swaps, physical forward sales and purchases, but for which the fair value or cash flow hedge elections were not made. Additionally, Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts and foreign
exchange currency swaps ( treasury ) to manage the exposure related to the interest rate component of commodity positions and international purchases of commodities in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. For the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the following net  pre-tax    mark-to-market   gains (losses) of certain purchase and sale
contracts were reported in Operating

    Proprietary Trading Activities (Exelon and Generation).  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and
2014 Exelon and Generation recognized the following net unrealized   mark-to-market   gains (losses), net realized   mark-to-market   gains (losses) and total net   mark-to-market   gains (losses), before income taxes, relating to   mark-to-market   activity on commodity derivative instruments entered into for proprietary trading purposes and interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge
risk associated with the interest rate and foreign exchange components of underlying commodity positions. Gains and losses associated with proprietary trading are reported as operating revenues in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are included in  Net fair value changes related to derivatives  in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the tables below,  Change in fair
value  represents the change in fair value of the derivative contracts held at the reporting date. The  Reclassification to realized at settlement  represents the recognized change in fair value that was reclassified to realized due
to settlement of the derivative during the period.      
     Credit Risk (All Registrants)

collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. For energy-related derivative instruments, Generation enters into enabling agreements that allow for payment
netting with its counterparties, which reduces Generation s exposure to counterparty risk by providing for the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. Typically, each enabling agreement is
for a specific commodity and so, with respect to each individual counterparty, netting is limited to transactions involving that specific commodity product, except where master netting agreements exist with a counterparty that allow for cross
product netting. In addition to payment netting language in the enabling agreement, Generation s credit department establishes credit limits, margining thresholds and collateral requirements for each counterparty, which are defined in the
derivative contracts. Counterparty credit limits are based on an internal credit review process that considers a variety of factors, including the results of a scoring model, leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings by credit rating
agencies, and risk management capabilities. To the extent that a counterparty s margining thresholds are exceeded, the counterparty is required to post collateral with Generation as specified in each enabling agreement. Generation s credit
department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis.    The
following tables provide information on Generation s credit exposure for all derivative instruments, NPNS, and applicable payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of
December 31, 2016. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties. The figures in the tables below exclude credit risk
exposure from individual retail counterparties, Nuclear fuel procurement contracts and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE and Nodal commodity exchanges. Additionally, the figures in the tables below exclude exposures with affiliates, including
net receivables with ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE of $14 million, $33 million $26 million, $44 million, $16 million and $9 million as of December 31, 2016, respectively.  

(a) 
 As of December 31, 2016, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $9 million of cash and $16 million of letters of credit. The credit collateral does not
include  non-liquid  collateral.

  ComEd s power procurement contracts provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit.
The credit position is based on forward market prices compared to the benchmark prices. The benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the contract term and are set at the point of supplier bid submittals. If the forward
market price of energy exceeds the benchmark price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion after adjusting for any unpaid deliveries and unsecured credit allowed under the contract. The unsecured credit used by
the suppliers represents ComEd s net credit exposure. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd s net credit exposure to suppliers was approximately $1 million.  
 ComEd is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd s counterparty credit risk is
mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.  
 PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s performance
assurance requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies
and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent
that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit used by the
suppliers represents PECO s net credit exposure. As of December 31, 2016, PECO had no net credit exposure to suppliers.    PECO is permitted
to recover its costs of procuring electric supply through its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. PECO s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters
for additional information.    PECO s natural gas procurement plan is reviewed and approved annually on a prospective basis by the PAPUC.
PECO s counterparty credit risk under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements is mitigated by its ability to recover its natural gas costs through the PGC, which allows PECO to adjust rates quarterly to reflect realized natural
gas prices. PECO does not obtain collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements. As of December 31, 2016, PECO had no material credit exposure under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements
with investment grade suppliers.    BGE is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the MDPSC-approved procurement tariffs.
BGE s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.  
 BGE s full requirement wholesale electric power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a
supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier, or its guarantor, to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest
credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth, subject to an unsecured credit cap. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a
transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is
greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The

unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents BGE s net credit exposure. The seller s credit exposure is calculated each business day. As of December 31, 2016, BGE had no net
credit exposure to suppliers.    BGE s regulated gas business is exposed to market-price risk. This market-price risk is mitigated by BGE s
recovery of its costs to procure natural gas through a gas cost adjustment clause approved by the MDPSC. BGE does make  off-system  sales after BGE has satisfied its customers  demands, which are not
covered by the gas cost adjustment clause. At December 31, 2016, BGE had credit exposure of $8 million related to  off-system  sales which is mitigated by parental guarantees, letters of credit, or
right to offset clauses within other contracts with those third-party suppliers.    Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s power procurement
contracts provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth.
The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy
exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents Pepco s,
DPL s and ACE s net credit exposure. As of December 31, 2016, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s net credit exposures to suppliers were immaterial.  
 Pepco is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the MDPSC-approved and DCPSC-approved procurement tariffs. DPL is permitted to
recover its costs of procuring energy through the MDPSC-approved and DPSC-approved procurement tariffs. ACE is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the NJBPU-approved procurement tariffs. Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s
counterparty credit risks are mitigated by their ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.  
 DPL s natural gas procurement plan is reviewed and approved annually on a prospective basis by the DPSC. DPL s counterparty credit risk under
its natural gas supply and asset management agreements is mitigated by its ability to recover its natural gas costs through the GCR, which allows DPL to adjust rates annually to reflect realized natural gas prices. To the extent that the fair value
of the transactions in a net loss position exceeds the unsecured credit threshold, then collateral is required to be posted in an amount equal to the amount by which the unsecured credit threshold is exceeded. Exchange-traded contracts are required
to be fully collateralized without regard to the credit rating of the holder. As of December 31, 2016, DPL had no credit exposure under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements with investment grade suppliers.  
   Collateral and Contingent-Related Features (All Registrants)    
 As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of
electric capacity, energy, fuels, emissions allowances and other energy-related products. Certain of Generation s derivative instruments contain provisions that require Generation to post collateral. Generation also enters into commodity
transactions on exchanges (i.e. NYMEX, ICE). The exchanges act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or
credit support with thresholds contingent upon Generation s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit-risk-related contingent
features stipulate that if  
      448

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide additional collateral. This incremental
collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements. In the absence of expressly  agreed-to  provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, Generation
believes an amount of several months of future payments (i.e. capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below.  
 The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully
collateralized (excluding transactions on the exchanges that are fully collateralized) is detailed in the table below:      

(a) 
 Amount represents the gross fair value of    out-of-the-money    derivative contracts containing
credit-risk-related contingent features ignoring the effects of master netting agreements.    

(b) 
 Amount represents the offsetting fair value of   in-the-money   derivative contracts under legally enforceable master netting agreements with
the same counterparty, which reduces the amount of any liability for which a Registrant could potentially be required to post collateral.    

(c) 
 Amount represents the net fair value of    out-of-the-money    derivative contracts containing
credit-risk related contingent features after considering the mitigating effects of offsetting positions under master netting arrangements and reflects the actual net liability upon which any potential contingent collateral obligations would be
based.      Generation had cash collateral posted of $347 million and letters of credit posted of $284 million, and cash
collateral held of $24 million and letters of credit held of $28 million as of December 31, 2016 for external counterparties with derivative positions. Generation had cash collateral posted of $1,267 million and letters of credit
posted of $497 million and cash collateral held of $21 million and letters of credit held of $78 million at December 31, 2015 for external counterparties with derivative positions. In the event of a credit downgrade below
investment grade (i.e. to BB+ by S P or Ba1 by Moody s), Generation would have been required to post additional collateral of $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts
represent the potential additional collateral required after giving consideration to offsetting derivative and  non-derivative  positions under master netting agreements.  
 Generation s and Exelon s interest rate swaps contain provisions that, in the event of a merger, if Generation s debt ratings were to
materially weaken, it would be in violation of these provisions, resulting in the ability of the counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to maturity. Collateralization would not be required under any circumstance. Termination of the agreement
could result in a settlement payment by Exelon or the counterparty on any interest rate swap in a net liability position. The settlement amount would be equal to the fair value of the swap on the termination date. As of December 31, 2016,
Generation s swaps had an immaterial fair value and Exelon s swaps were in an asset position with a fair value of $16 million.

  See Note 26 Segment Information for further information regarding the letters of credit supporting
the cash collateral.    Generation entered into supply forward contracts with certain utilities, including PECO and BGE, with  one-sided  collateral postings only from Generation. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities are not required to post collateral. However, when market prices rise
above the benchmark price levels, counterparty suppliers, including Generation, are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded. Under the terms of ComEd s standard block energy contracts, collateral postings
are  one-sided  from suppliers, including Generation, should exposures between market prices and benchmark prices exceed established unsecured credit limits outlined in the contracts. As of December 31,
2016, ComEd held approximately $3 million in collateral from suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts. Under the terms of ComEd s annual renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required to cover a fixed value
for RECs only. In addition, under the terms of ComEd s long-term renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required from suppliers for both RECs and energy. The REC portion is a fixed value and the energy portion is  one-sided  from suppliers should the forward market prices exceed contract prices. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd held approximately $19 million in the form of cash and letters of credit as margin for both
the annual and long-term REC obligations. If ComEd lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2016, it would have been required to post approximately $19 million of collateral to its counterparties. See Note
3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.    PECO s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require PECO to
post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon PECO s credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and
by counterparty. As of December 31, 2016, PECO was not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If PECO lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2016, PECO could have been required to post approximately
$31 million of collateral to its counterparties.    PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its DSP Program contracts do
not contain provisions that would require PECO to post collateral.    BGE s full requirements wholesale power agreements that govern the terms of
its electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require BGE to post collateral.    BGE s natural gas procurement
contracts contain provisions that could require BGE to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon BGE s credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. The
collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2016, BGE was not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If BGE lost its investment grade credit rating as of
December 31, 2016, BGE could have been required to post approximately $62 million of collateral to its counterparties.    Pepco s full
requirements wholesale power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require Pepco to post collateral.  
 DPL s full requirements wholesale power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions
that would require DPL to post collateral.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  DPL s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require DPL to post
collateral. To the extent that the fair value of the natural gas derivative transaction in a net loss position exceeds the unsecured credit threshold, then collateral is required to be posted in an amount equal to the amount by which the unsecured
credit threshold is exceeded. The DPL obligations are standalone, without the guaranty of PHI. If DPL lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2016, DPL could have been required to post an additional amount of approximately
$10 million of collateral to its natural gas counterparties.    ACE s full requirements wholesale power agreements that govern the terms of
its electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require ACE to post collateral.       14. Debt and
Credit Agreements (All Registrants)       Short-Term Borrowings    
 Exelon, ComEd, and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Generation and PECO meet their
short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. PHI meets its short-term liquidity requirement primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and the
Exelon intercompany money pool. Pepco, DPL and ACE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and short-term notes. The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate
purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.      Commercial Paper    
 The following table reflects the Registrants  commercial paper programs supported by the revolving credit agreements and bilateral credit agreements
at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      

(b) 
 Excludes additional credit facility agreements for Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE with aggregate commitments of $50 million, $34 million, $34 million, $5 million, $2 million,
$2 million and $2 million, respectively, arranged with minority and community banks located primarily within utilities  service territories. These facilities expire on October 13, 2017. These facilities are solely utilized to
issue letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, letters of credit issued under these facilities totaled $7 million, $12 million, $21 million and $2 million for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively.

  In order to maintain their respective commercial paper programs in the amounts indicated above, each
Registrant must have credit facilities in place, at least equal to the amount of its commercial paper program. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce available capacity under a Registrant s credit facility, a
Registrant does not issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the then available capacity under its credit facility.    At
December 31, 2016, the Registrants had the following aggregate bank commitments, credit facility borrowings and available capacity under their respective credit facilities:  

(a) 
 Excludes additional credit facility agreements for Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE with aggregate commitments of $50 million, $34 million, $34 million ,$5 million, $2 million,
$2 million and $2 million, respectively, arranged with minority and community banks located primarily within utilities  service territories. These facilities expire on October 13, 2017. These facilities are solely utilized to
issue letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, letters of credit issued under these facilities totaled $7 million, $12 million, $21 million and $2 million for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively.

(b) 
 Pepco, DPL and ACE s revolving credit facility is subject to available borrowing capacity. The borrowing capacity may be increased or decreased during the term of the facility, except that (i) the sum of the
borrowing capacity must equal the total amount of the facility, and (ii) the aggregate amount of credit used at any given time by each of Pepco, DPL or ACE may not exceed $900 million or the maximum amount of short-term debt the company is
permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities. The total number of the borrowing reallocations may not exceed eight per year during the term of the facility.    

(c) 
 Excludes nonrecourse debt letters of credit, see discussion below on Continental Wind.    

(d) 
 Excludes $500 million in bilateral credit facilities that do not back Generation s commercial paper program.    
 As of December 31, 2016, there was $75 million of borrowings under Generation s bilateral credit facilities.

     Short-Term Loan Agreements    
 On July 30, 2015, PHI entered into a $300 million term loan agreement. The net proceeds of the loan were used to repay PHI s outstanding
commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the loan agreement, loans made thereunder bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.95%, and all indebtedness thereunder is unsecured. On April 4, 2016, PHI repaid
$300 million of its term loan in full.    On January 13, 2016, PHI entered into a $500 million term loan agreement, which was amended
on March 28, 2016. The net proceeds of the loan were used to repay PHI s outstanding commercial paper, and for general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the loan agreement, as amended, loans made thereunder bear interest at a variable rate
equal to LIBOR plus 1%, and all indebtedness thereunder is unsecured, and the aggregate principal amount of all loans, together with any accrued but unpaid interest due under the Loan Agreement, must be repaid in full on or before
March 27, 2017. The loan agreement is reflected in Exelon s and PHI s Consolidated Balance Sheets within Short-term borrowings.    On
February 22, 2016, Generation and EDF entered into separate member revolving promissory notes with CENG to finance short-term working capital needs. The notes are scheduled to mature on January 31, 2017 and bear interest at a variable rate
equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%. On July 25, 2016, CENG paid off the outstanding balances under each note.      Credit Agreements    
 On January 5, 2016, Generation entered into a credit agreement establishing a $150 million bilateral credit facility, scheduled to mature in
January of 2019. This facility will solely be utilized by Generation to issue lines of credit. This facility does not back Generation s commercial paper program.  
      454  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  On April 1, 2016, the credit agreement for CENG s $100 million bilateral credit facility
was amended to increase the overall facility size to $200 million. This facility is utilized by CENG to fund working capital and capital projects. The facility does not back Generation s commercial paper program.  
 On May 26, 2016, Exelon Corporate, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE entered into amendments to each of their respective syndicated revolving credit
facilities, which extended the maturity of each of the facilities to May 26, 2021. Exelon Corporate also increased the size of its facility from $500 million to $600 million. On May 26, 2016, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE entered into
an amendment to their Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 1, 2011, which (i) extended the maturity date of the facility to May 26, 2021, (ii) removed PHI as a borrower under the facility,
(iii) decreased the size of the facility from $1.5 billion to $900 million and (iv) aligned its financial covenant from debt to capitalization leverage ratio to interest coverage ratio.  
 Borrowings under Exelon Corporate s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s, and ACE s revolving
credit agreements bear interest at a rate based upon either the prime rate or a LIBOR-based rate, plus an adder based upon the particular Registrant s credit rating. The adders for the prime based borrowings and LIBOR-based borrowings are
presented in the following table:      
   The maximum adders for prime rate borrowings and LIBOR-based rate borrowings are 90 basis points and 165 basis points,
respectively. The credit agreements also require the borrower to pay a facility fee based upon the aggregate commitments. The fee varies depending upon the respective credit ratings of the borrower.  
 An event of default under any of the Registrants  credit agreements would not constitute an event of default under any of the other
Registrants  credit agreements, except that a bankruptcy or other event of default in the payment of principal, premium or indebtedness in principal amount in excess of $100 million in the aggregate by Generation under its credit agreement
would constitute an event of default under the Exelon Corporation credit agreement.    Each credit agreement requires the affected borrower to
maintain a minimum cash from operations to interest expense ratio for the twelve-month period ended on the last day of any quarter. The ratios exclude revenues and interest expenses attributable to securitization debt, certain changes in working
capital, distributions on preferred securities of subsidiaries and, in the case of Exelon and Generation, interest on the debt of its project subsidiaries. The following table summarizes the minimum thresholds reflected in the credit agreements for
the year ended December 31, 2016:      
   At December 31, 2016, the interest coverage ratios at the Registrants were as follows:

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  Through May 26, 2016, when Pepco, DPL and ACE entered into a new restated credit agreement, as
mentioned above, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE had maintained an unsecured syndicated credit facility to provide for their respective liquidity needs, including obtaining letters of credit, borrowing for general corporate purposes and supporting their
commercial paper programs. The termination date of this credit facility was August 1, 2018.    The aggregate borrowing limit under the amended
and restated credit facility was $1.5 billion, all or any portion of which could have been used to obtain loans and up to $500 million of which could have been used to obtain letters of credit. The facility also included a swingline loan  sub-facility,  pursuant to which each company could have made same day borrowings in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10% of the total amount of the facility. Any swingline loan had to be repaid by the borrower
within fourteen days of receipt. The credit sublimit was $750 million for PHI and $250 million for each of Pepco, DPL and ACE. The sublimits could have been increased or decreased by the individual borrower during the term of the facility,
except that (i) the sum of all of the borrower sublimits following any such increase or decrease had to equal the total amount of the facility and (ii) the aggregate amount of credit used at any given time by (a) PHI could not exceed
$1.25 billion and (b) each of Pepco, DPL or ACE could not exceed the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of short-term debt the company was permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities. The total number of the
sublimit reallocations could not exceed eight per year during the term of the facility.    The interest rate payable by each company on utilized funds
was, at the borrowing company s election, (i) the greater of the prevailing prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% and the  one-month  London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.0%,
or (ii) the prevailing Eurodollar rate, plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of the borrower.    In order for a borrower to
use the facility, certain representations and warranties had to be true and correct, and the borrower had to be in compliance with specified financial and other covenants, including (i) the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a
ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, which calculation excluded from the definition of total indebtedness certain trust preferred securities and deferrable
interest subordinated debt (not to exceed 15% of total capitalization), (ii) with certain exceptions, a restriction on sales or other dispositions of assets, and (iii) a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of a borrower or any
of its significant subsidiaries other than permitted liens. The credit agreement contained certain covenants and other customary agreements and requirements that, if not complied with, resulted in an event of default and the acceleration of
repayment obligations of one or more of the borrowers thereunder.    The absence of a material adverse change in PHI s business, property,
results of operations or financial condition was not a condition to the availability of credit under the credit agreement. The credit agreement did not include any rating triggers.  
   Variable Rate Demand Bonds      DPL has
outstanding obligations in respect of Variable Rate Demand Bonds (VRDB). VRDBs are subject to repayment on the demand of the holders and, for this reason, are accounted for as short-term debt in accordance with GAAP. However, bonds submitted for
purchase are remarketed by a remarketing agent on a best efforts basis. PHI expects that any bonds submitted for purchase will be remarketed successfully due to the creditworthiness of the issuer and, as applicable, the credit support, and because
the remarketing resets the interest rate to the then-current market rate. The bonds may

be converted to a fixed-rate, fixed-term option to establish a maturity which corresponds to the date of final maturity of the bonds. On this basis, PHI views VRDBs as a source of long-term
financing. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $105 million in variable rate demand bonds issued by DPL were outstanding and are included in the Long-term debt due within one year on Exelon s, PHI s and DPL s

 In May 2014, concurrently and in connection with entering into the agreement to acquire PHI, Exelon entered into a credit facility to which the lenders
committed to provide Exelon a  364-day  senior unsecured bridge credit facility of $7.2 billion to support the contemplated transaction and provide flexibility for timing of permanent financing. In June
2015, the remaining $3.2 billion bridge credit facility was terminated as a result of Exelon s issuance of $4.2 billion of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price and related costs and expenses for the pending PHI
merger and for general corporate purposes.    In connection with the $4.2 billion issuance of Senior Unsecured Notes in 2015, the tranches due in
2025, 2035, and 2045 had to be redeemed at the principal amount plus a 1% premium of principal on December 31, 2015, if the PHI merger was not consummated or terminated prior to such date ( Special Mandatory Redemption ). Exelon also
had the option to redeem those notes earlier at a 1% premium of principal, if Exelon determined that the merger would not be completed before December 31, 2015.  
 On October 29, 2015, Exelon commenced a private exchange offer (Exchange Offer) to certain eligible holders whereby, for those that took part, the
outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes in the 2025, 2035 and 2045 tranches were exchanged for new Senior Unsecured Notes.    On December 2, 2015,
Exelon exchanged $1.9 billion of the Senior Unsecured Notes and paid a consent fee of approximately $5 million, which has been deferred on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheet and $4 million of third-party debt issuance costs,
which were charged to earnings within Other, net on Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. On December 2, 2015, Exelon also redeemed $0.9 billion of Senior Unsecured Notes not exchanged in the Exchange
Offer resulting in the payment of $9 million of redemption premium and the acceleration of the unamortized original issuance discount and deferred financing costs associated with the redeemed debt of $9 million, which were charged to
earnings within Other, net on Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

    Junior Subordinated Notes    
 In June 2014, Exelon issued $1.15 billion of junior subordinated notes in the form of 23 million equity units at a stated amount of $50.00 per
unit. Net proceeds from the issuance were $1.11 billion, net of a $35 million underwriter fee. The net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the merger and related costs and expenses for the pending PHI merger and for general
corporate purposes. Each equity unit represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in Exelon s 2.50% junior subordinated notes due in 2024 and a forward equity purchase contract which settles in 2017. The junior subordinated notes are
expected to be remarketed in 2017.    At the time of issuance, Exelon determined that the forward equity purchase contract had no value and therefore
the entire $1.15 billion of junior subordinated notes were allocated to debt and recorded within Long-term debt on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, at the time of issuance, the present value of the contract payments of
$131 million ( Contract Payment Obligation ) were recorded to Long-term debt, representing the obligation to make contract payments, with an offsetting reduction to Common stock. The obligation for the contract payments is accreted to
interest expense over the 3 year period ending in 2017 in Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. During 2016, contract payments of $45 million related to the Contract Payment Obligation were included within
Retirements of long-term debt in Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During 2015, contract payments of $44 million related to the Contract Payment Obligation were included within Retirements of long-term debt in Exelon s
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During 2014, the Contract Payment Obligation was considered a  non-cash  financing transaction that was excluded from Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Until settlement of the equity purchase contract, earnings per share dilution resulting from the equity unit issuance will be determined under the treasury stock method.  
   Nonrecourse Debt      Exelon and Generation have issued
nonrecourse debt financing, in which approximately $2.8 billion of generating assets have been pledged as collateral at December 31, 2016. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project.
The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event of a default. If a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific nonrecourse debt financing covenants, there could be a requirement to
accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the
project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective
project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives.      Denver Airport.      In June 2011,
Generation entered into a  20-year,  $7 million solar loan agreement to finance a solar construction project in Denver, Colorado. The agreement is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2031. The agreement
bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% annually with interest payable annually. As of December 31, 2016, $6 million was outstanding.  
   CEU Upstream.      In July 2011, CEU Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into a  5-year  reserve based lending agreement (RBL) associated with certain Upstream oil and gas properties. The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event of default pursuant to the
RBL. Borrowings under this arrangement are secured by the assets and equity of CEU

Holdings. The commitment level can be decreased if the assets no longer support the current borrowing base, which may result in repayment of a portion or all of the outstanding balance, or
potential foreclosure of the assets. The commitment can be increased up to $500 million million if the assets support a higher borrowing base and CEU Holdings is able to obtain additional commitments from lenders. Calculations of the borrowing
base are impacted by projected production and commodity prices. The facility was amended and extended on January 14, 2014 through January 2019. As of December 31, 2015, $68 million was outstanding under the facility with interest
payable monthly at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% and the borrowing base committed under the facility was $85 million. The outstanding balance was classified as Long-term debt on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated
Balance Sheets.    In February 2016, as part of their semi-annual borrowing base  re-determination  testing, the
RBL lenders notified CEU Holdings that the RBL borrowing base was decreased to $45 million, resulting in a  borrowing base deficiency  under the RBL of $23 million. Given the decline in value of the Upstream assets resulting from
lower commodity prices, CEU Holdings chose not to provide the lenders with a formal plan for curing the borrowing base deficiency by March 31, 2016, as was required by the RBL. The lenders sent CEU Holdings a notice of event of default and
demand for cure.    On June 16, 2016, CEU Holdings executed a forbearance agreement with the lenders which included terms stipulating roles and
responsibilities governing a sales process, approval of the sale of the assets to be at the discretion of the lenders, and a sales timetable.    In
December 2016, substantially all of the Upstream natural gas and oil exploration and production assets were sold for $37 million. The proceeds were used to reduce the debt balance by $31 million. The remaining proceeds of $6 million
are being held in escrow and will be released at final settlement. In addition, during 2016, $15 million of the debt was repaid using CEU Holding s cash, resulting in an outstanding debt balance of $22 million with interest payable
monthly at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.75%. Upon disposition of all of the assets and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, CEU Holdings will be released of its obligations regardless of the amount of asset sale proceeds received.
The ultimate resolution of this matter has no direct effect on any Exelon or Generation credit facilities or other debt of an Exelon entity. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding debt balance of $22 million was classified within Long term
debt due within one year on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions and Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for additional information.  
   Holyoke Solar Cooperative.      In October 2011, Generation entered into a
 20-year,  $11 million solar loan agreement related to a solar construction project in Holyoke, Massachusetts. The agreement is scheduled to mature on December 2031. The agreement bears interest at a fixed
rate of 5.25% annually with interest payable monthly. As of December 31, 2016, $9 million was outstanding.      Antelope Valley Solar
Ranch One.      In December 2011, the DOE Loan Programs Office issued a guarantee for up to $646 million for a nonrecourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the
Antelope Valley facility. The project became fully operational in the first half of 2014. The loan will mature on January 5, 2037. Interest rates on the loan were fixed upon each advance at a spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of
comparable maturity. The advances were completed as of December 31, 2015 and the outstanding loan balance will bear interest at an average blended interest rate of 2.82%. As of December 31, 2016, $552 million was outstanding. In
addition, Generation has issued letters of credit to support its equity investment in the project. As of December 31, 2016, Generation had $106 million in letters of credit outstanding related to the project.

    Continental Wind.      In September 2013, Continental Wind, LLC
(Continental Wind), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, completed the issuance and sale of $613 million senior secured notes. Continental Wind owns and operates a portfolio of wind farms in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Oregon, New
Mexico and Texas with a total net capacity of 667MW. The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for its general business purposes. The notes are scheduled to mature on February 28, 2033. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.00%
with interest payable semi-annually. As of December 31, 2016, $543 million was outstanding.    In addition, Continental Wind entered into a
$131 million letter of credit facility and $10 million working capital revolver facility. Continental Wind has issued letters of credit to satisfy certain of its credit support and security obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the
Continental Wind letter of credit facility had $108 million in letters of credit outstanding related to the project.      ExGen Renewables
I.      In February 2014, EGR, an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, borrowed $300 million aggregate principal amount pursuant to a nonrecourse senior secured loan. The proceeds were distributed to
Generation for its general business purposes. The loan is scheduled to mature on February 6, 2021. The loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 4.25%, subject to a 1% LIBOR floor with interest payable quarterly. EGR indirectly
owns Continental Wind. As of December 31, 2016, $234 million was outstanding. In addition to the financing, EGR entered into interest rate swaps with an initial notional amount of $240 million at an interest rate of 2.03% to manage a
portion of the interest rate exposure in connection with the financing. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding interest rate swaps.  
   ExGen Texas Power.      In September 2014, EGTP, an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, issued
$675 million aggregate principal amount of a nonrecourse senior secured term loan. The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for general business purposes. The loan is scheduled to mature on September 18, 2021. The term loan
bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 4.75%, subject to a 1% LIBOR floor with interest payable quarterly. As of December 31, 2016, $660 million was outstanding. As part of the agreement, a revolving credit facility was
established for the amount of $20 million available through, and scheduled to mature on September 18, 2019. In addition to the financing, EGTP entered into various interest rate swaps with an initial notional amount of approximately
$505 million at an interest rate of 2.34% to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure in connection with this financing, as required by the debt covenants. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information
regarding interest rate swaps.    EGTP s operating cash flows have been negatively impacted by certain market conditions including, but not
limited to: low power prices, higher fuel prices and the seasonality of its cash flows. Despite the declining operating cash flows, EGTP remains in compliance with its covenants related to the project specific financing. Management continues to
monitor the project entity s short term liquidity needs.      Renewable Power Generation.      In March 2016, RPG,
an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of a nonrecourse senior secured notes. The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for paydown of long term debt obligations at Sacramento

   Exelon, Generation, and ComEd have $83 million, $7 million, and $(12) million of unrecognized tax benefits
balance at December 31, 2016 for which the ultimate tax benefit is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such benefits.  
 Exelon, Generation, and ComEd had $415 million, $20 million, and $142 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 for
which the ultimate tax benefit is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such benefits    Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PECO, and PHI had $1,122 million, $680 million, $149 million, $43 million, and $686 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 for which the ultimate tax benefit is highly certain, but for which there is
uncertainty about the timing of such benefits    The disallowance of such positions would not materially affect the annual effective tax rate but
would accelerate the payment of cash to, or defer the receipt of the cash tax benefit from, the taxing authority to an earlier or later period respectively.  
   Unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate    
 Exelon, Generation, PHI, Pepco, ACE, and DPL have $633 million, $483 million, $93 million, $21 million, $22 million, and
$16 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate. BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL have $120 million, $80 million, $59 million, and
$21 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 that, if recognized, may be included in future base rates and that portion would have no impact to the effective tax rate.  
 Exelon, Generation, and PHI had $538 million, $509 million, and $11 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at
December 31, 2015 that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate. BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL had $120 million, $11 million, $8 million, and $3 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 that, if

  Exelon, Generation, and PHI had $701 million, $672 million, and $15 million,
respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate.      Reasonably
possible that total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within 12 months after the reporting date    
  Settlement of Income Tax Audits and Litigation   
 As of December 31, 2016, Exelon, Generation, PHI, Pepco, ACE and DPL have approximately $146 million, $19 million, $59 million,
$21 million, $22 million and $16 million, respectively, of unrecognized federal and state tax benefits that will decrease in the first quarter of 2017 due to the receipt in January of favorable IRS guidance as to whether certain
business expenses should be capitalized or deducted. The recognition of these unrecognized tax benefits will decrease the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2017.  
 As of December 31, 2016, Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL have approximately $244 million, $44 million, $120 million,
$80 million, $59 million, and $21 million, respectively, of unrecognized state tax benefits that could significantly decrease within the 12 months after the reporting date as a result of completing audits, potential settlements, and
expected statute of limitation expirations. Of the above unrecognized tax benefits, Exelon and Generation have $44 million that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefit related to BGE, Pepco, and DPL
if recognized, may be included in future base rates and that portion would have no impact to the effective tax rate.      Total amounts of

    Other Tax Matters   
   Like-Kind Exchange      Exelon, through its
ComEd subsidiary, took a position on its 1999 income tax return to defer approximately $1.2 billion of tax gain on the sale of ComEd s fossil generating assets. The gain was deferred by reinvesting a portion of the proceeds from the sale
in qualifying replacement property under the like-kind exchange provisions of the IRC. The like-kind exchange replacement property purchased by Exelon included interests in three municipal-owned electric generation facilities which were properly
leased back to the municipalities.    The IRS disagreed with this position and asserted that the entire gain of approximately $1.2 billion was
taxable in 1999. Exelon was unable to reach agreement with the IRS regarding the dispute over  
      473

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
the like-kind exchange position. The IRS asserted that the Exelon purchase and leaseback transaction was substantially similar to a leasing transaction, known as a SILO, which the IRS does not
respect as the acquisition of an ownership interest in property. A SILO is a  listed transaction  that the IRS has identified as a potentially abusive tax shelter under guidance issued in 2005. Accordingly, the IRS asserted that the sale
of the fossil plants followed by the purchase and leaseback of the municipal owned generation facilities did not qualify as a like-kind exchange and the gain on the sale is fully subject to tax. The IRS also asserted a penalty of approximately
$90 million for a substantial understatement of tax.    In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Exelon was required to assess whether
it was  more-likely-than-not  that to prevail in litigation. In light of the outcome of another case involving a listed transaction and Exelon s determination that settlement was unlikely, Exelon concluded
that subsequent to December 31, 2012, it was no longer  more-likely-than-not  that its position would be sustained. As a result, in the first quarter of 2013 Exelon recorded a
 non-cash  charge to earnings of approximately $265 million, which represented the amount of interest expense  (after-tax)  and incremental state income tax expense for
periods through March 31, 2013, that would be payable in the event that Exelon is unsuccessful in litigation. Of this amount, approximately $172 million was recorded at ComEd. Exelon has agreed to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable
impacts on ComEd s equity of the  after-tax  interest or penalty amounts. As a result, ComEd recorded on its consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2013, a $172 million receivable and  non-cash  equity contributions from Exelon. Based on applicable case law and the facts of the transaction, Exelon did not believe it was likely a penalty would be assessed. Accordingly, no charge was recorded for the
penalty asserted nor for  after-tax  interest that could be due on the asserted penalty.    On
September 30, 2013, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency to Exelon for the like-kind exchange position. Exelon filed a petition on December 13, 2013 to initiate litigation in the United States Tax Court and the trial took place in August
of 2015. Exelon was not required to remit any part of the asserted tax or penalty in order to litigate the issue.    On September 19, 2016, the
Tax Court rejected Exelon s position in the case and ruled that Exelon was not entitled to defer gain on the transaction. In addition, contrary to Exelon s evaluation that the penalty was unwarranted, the Tax Court ruled that Exelon is
liable for the penalty and interest due on the asserted penalty. In the second quarter of 2017, Exelon expects to timely appeal this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  
 While it has strong arguments on appeal with respect to both the merits and the penalty, Exelon has determined that, pursuant to accounting standards,
it is no longer  more-likely-than-not  to avoid the penalty. As a result, in the third quarter of 2016, Exelon and ComEd recorded a charge to earnings of approximately $106 million and $86 million,
respectively, of penalty and approximately $94 million and $64 million, respectively, of  after-tax  interest. Exelon and ComEd recorded the penalty and  pre-tax 
interest due on the asserted penalty to Other, net and Interest expense, net, respectively, on their Consolidated Statements of Operations. Consistent with Exelon s agreement to continue to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impact on its
equity, ComEd recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016, a $150 million receivable and  non-cash  equity contributions from Exelon.  
 In order to appeal the decision, Exelon is required to pay the tax, penalty and interest at the time Exelon files its appeal (expected in the second
quarter of 2017). While the final calculation of tax, penalty and interest has not yet been finalized by the IRS, Exelon estimates that a payment of  
      474

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
approximately $1.4 billion related to the like-kind exchange will be due, including $300 million from ComEd, in the second quarter of 2017. While Exelon will receive a tax benefit of
$400 million associated with the deduction for the interest, Exelon expects to have a net operating loss carryforward and thus does not expect to realize the cash benefit until 2018. After taking into account these interest deduction tax
benefits, the total estimated net cash outflow for the like-kind exchange is $1 billion, of which approximately $300 million is attributable to ComEd after giving consideration to Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless from any
unfavorable impacts of  after-tax  interest or penalty amounts on ComEd s equity. Upon a final appellate decision, which could take up to several years, Exelon expects to receive $80 million related to
final interest computations.    Of the above amounts payable, Exelon deposited with the IRS approximately $1.25 billion in October of 2016. The
remaining amount will be paid in the second quarter of 2017 at the time Exelon files its appeal of the Tax Court decision. Exelon funded the $1.25 billion deposit with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. The deposit is
reflected as a current asset and the related liabilities for the tax, penalty, and interest are included on Exelon s balance sheet as current obligations.  
 As of December 31, 2016, ComEd has a total receivable from Exelon pursuant to the hold harmless agreement of $345 million, which is included
in Current Receivables from Affiliates on ComEd s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under the agreement, Exelon will settle this receivable with ComEd no later than the time that the payments related to the like-kind exchange are due to the IRS,
currently anticipated in the second quarter of 2017. Exelon will not seek recovery from ComEd customers for any interest or penalty amounts associated with the like-kind exchange tax position.  
 As previously disclosed, in the first quarter of 2014, Exelon entered into an agreement to terminate its investment in one of the three municipal-owned
electric generation properties in exchange for a net early termination amount of $335 million. On March 31, 2016, Exelon entered into an agreement to terminate its interests in the remaining two municipal-owned electric generation
properties in exchange for $360 million.     PHI Global Tax Settlement   
 On November 18, 2015, PHI entered into a settlement with the IRS and the DOJ (the Global Tax Settlement) to primarily provide for the resolution of
the uncertain tax treatment of its previously held cross-border energy lease investments involving public utility assets located outside of the United States structured as  sale-in,   lease-out,  or SILO, transactions.    As a result of the Global Tax Settlement in the fourth quarter of 2015, PHI  re-measured  uncertain tax positions resulting in the recognition of a tax benefit of $35 million, including $26 million related to continuing operations and $9 million related to discontinued
operations. PHI also recorded an interest benefit, net of tax, of $21 million. Pepco recorded a tax benefit of $6 million and interest benefit, net of tax, of $3 million. ACE and DPL recorded a tax expense of $3 million and
$3 million, respectively.      Long-Term State Tax Apportionment (Exelon, Generation and PHI)    
 Exelon, Generation and PHI periodically review events that may significantly impact how income is apportioned among the states and, therefore, the
calculation of their respective deferred state income taxes. Events that may require Exelon, Generation and PHI to update their long-term state tax apportionment include significant changes in tax law and/or significant operational changes, such as
 
      475

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
the merger with PHI. As a result of the merger, Exelon and Generation reevaluated their long-term state tax apportionment for all states where they have state income tax obligations, which
include Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C., as well as other states. The total effect of revising the long-term state tax apportionment resulted in the recording of deferred state tax benefit in the amount of
$1 million and $6 million, net of tax, for Exelon and Generation, respectively. Further, Exelon and PHI recorded deferred state tax liabilities of $59 million and $8 million, net of tax, respectively, as part of purchase
accounting during the first quarter of 2016. The long-term state tax apportionment was revised in the fourth quarter of 2016 pursuant to Exelon s long-term state tax apportionment policy, resulting in the recording of a deferred state tax
expense for Exelon and Generation of $8 million and $14 million, net of tax.      Allocation of Tax Benefits (All Registrants)
     Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are all party to an agreement with Exelon and other subsidiaries of Exelon that
provides for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits (Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately
subject to tax. In addition, any net benefit attributable to Exelon is reallocated to the other Registrants. That allocation is treated as a contribution to the capital of the party receiving the benefit. During 2016, Generation, PECO, and BGE
recorded an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $94 million, $18 million, and $8 million respectively. ComEd did not record an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax
Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss. PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE did not record an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon as they were not a part of Exelon s 2015 consolidated tax return.  
 During 2015, Generation, PECO, and BGE recorded an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $57 million,
$16 million, and $7 million respectively. ComEd did not record an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.  
 During 2014, Generation and PECO recorded an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $55 million and
$25 million, respectively. ComEd and BGE did not record an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of tax net operating losses.  
    16. Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)   
   Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations    
 Generation has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating licenses. To estimate its
decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a   unit-by-unit   basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow
models and discount rates. Generation updates its ARO annually unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various
scenarios.  
      476

  The following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning ARO reflected on
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets, from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016:      

(a) 
 Includes $10 million and $7 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is included in Other current liabilities on Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.      During 2016, Generation s total nuclear ARO increased by approximately $488 million, primarily
reflecting   year-to-date   accretion of the ARO liability of approximately $436 million due to the passage of time and impacts of ARO updates completed during 2016 to
reflect changes in amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows.    The $61 million increase in the ARO during 2016 for changes in
the amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows was driven by multiple adjustments throughout the year, some with offsetting impacts. These adjustments include increases of $288 million resulting from the change in the assumed
DOE spent fuel acceptance date for disposal from 2025 to 2030 as well as increases resulting from updates to the cost studies of Oyster Creek, Zion, Calvert Cliffs, R.E. Ginna and Nine Mile Point. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
of $165 million resulting from changes to the decommissioning scenarios and their probabilities as well as reductions in estimated cost escalation rates, primarily for labor, energy and waste burial costs. Most of the increase to the ARO
resulting from the June 2, 2016, announcement to early retire Clinton and Quad Cities was reversed pursuant to the December 7, 2016, enactment of the Illinois FEJA. See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements for additional
information.    The financial statement impact related to changes in the ARO, on an individual unit basis, due to the changes in, and timing of,
estimated cash flows primarily resulted in a corresponding change in the unit s ARC within Property, plant and equipment on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the ARO decreases for a unit that does not have
any remaining ARC, the corresponding change is recorded as a credit to income in Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Approximately $89 million
of the 2016 adjustment resulted in a credit to income, which is included in Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
 During 2015, Generation s ARO increased by approximately $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of approximately
$630 million for costs expected to be incurred for required site security during the decommissioning periods in which SNF remains  on-site  and until major reactor components and buildings have been
dismantled and removed. This projected increase was based on emerging industry experience at nuclear sites in the planning or early stage of decommissioning indicating greater than originally expected numbers of security personnel required
to  
      477

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
be on site during these decommissioning periods. Generation will continue to monitor emerging security cost trends, including potential strategies to limit such costs by, for example,
optimizing the transfer of SNF when DOE starts taking possession of SNF or increasing the use of dry SNF storage, and will adjust the ARO liability accordingly. The 2015 increase in the ARO included an increase of approximately
$285 million for the impacts of a change implemented in the 2015 annual assessment of Generation s SNF storage and disposal cost estimation methodology to better align the projected timing of SNF transfers to the DOE with assumed plant
shutdown dates as well as higher assumed probabilities of early retirements of certain economically challenged nuclear plants (See Note 9 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements for additional information) and further accretion of the obligation. These
increases were partially offset by reductions in estimated cost escalation rates, primarily for labor and energy costs.      Nuclear Decommissioning
Trust Fund Investments      NDT funds have been established for each generating station unit to satisfy Generation s nuclear
decommissioning obligations. Generally, NDT funds established for a particular unit may not be used to fund the decommissioning obligations of any other unit.  
 The NDT funds associated with Generation s nuclear units have been funded with amounts collected from the previous owners and their respective
utility customers. PECO is authorized to collect funds, in revenues, for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants through regulated rates, and these collections are scheduled through the operating lives of the former PECO plants. The amounts
collected from PECO customers are remitted to Generation and deposited into the NDT funds for the unit for which funds are collected. Every five years, PECO files a rate adjustment with the PAPUC that reflects PECO s calculations of the
estimated amount needed to decommission each of the former PECO units based on updated fund balances and estimated decommissioning costs. The rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from PECO customers. The most recent rate
adjustment occurred on January 1, 2013, and the effective rates currently yield annual collections of approximately $24 million. The next five-year adjustment is expected to be reflected in rates charged to PECO customers effective
January 1, 2018. Aside from the former PECO units, Generation does not currently collect any amounts, nor is there any mechanism by which Generation can seek to collect additional amounts, from utility customers. Apart from the contributions
made to the NDT funds from amounts previously collected from ComEd and currently collected from PECO customers, Generation has not made contributions to the NDT funds.  
 Any shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning, determined for each generating station unit, is ultimately required to be funded by Generation,
with the exception of a shortfall for the current decommissioning activities at Zion Station, where certain decommissioning activities have been transferred to a third-party (see Zion Station Decommissioning below) and the CENG units, where any
shortfall is required to be funded by both Generation and EDF. Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers related to a shortfall of NDT funds for the former PECO units, subject to certain limitations and
thresholds, as prescribed by an order from the PAPUC. Generally, PECO, and likewise Generation will not be allowed to collect amounts associated with the first $50 million of any shortfall of trust funds compared to decommissioning costs, as
well as 5% of any additional shortfalls, on an aggregate basis for all former PECO units. The initial $50 million and up to 5% of any additional shortfalls would be borne by Generation. No recourse exists to collect additional amounts from
utility customers for any of Generation s other nuclear units. With respect to the former ComEd and PECO units, any funds remaining in the NDTs after all decommissioning has been completed are required to be refunded to ComEd s or
PECO s customers, subject to certain limitations that allow sharing of excess funds with Generation related to the former PECO units. With  
      478

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
respect to Generation s other nuclear units, Generation retains any funds remaining after decommissioning. However, in connection with CENG s acquisition of the Nine Mile Point and
Ginna plants and settlements with certain regulatory agencies, CENG is subject to certain conditions pertaining to nuclear decommissioning trust funds that, if met, could possibly result in obligations to make payments to certain third parties
(clawbacks). For Nine Mile Point and Ginna, the clawback provisions are triggered only in the event that the required decommissioning activities are discontinued or not started or completed in a timely manner. In the event that the clawback
provisions are triggered for Nine Mile Point, then, depending upon the triggering event, an amount equal to 50% of the total amount withdrawn from the funds for  non-decommissioning  activities or 50% of any
excess funds in the trust funds above the amounts required for decommissioning (including spent fuel management and decommissioning) is to be paid to the Nine Mile Point sellers. In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for Ginna,
then an amount equal to any estimated cost savings realized by not completing any of the required decommissioning activities is to be paid to the Ginna sellers. Generation expects to comply with applicable regulations and timely commence and
complete all required decommissioning activities.    At December 31, 2016, and 2015, Exelon and Generation had NDT fund investments totaling
$11,061 million and $10,342 million, respectively. For additional information related to the NDT fund investments, refer to Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities.  
 The following table provides unrealized gains on NDT funds for 2016, 2015 and 2014:  

(a) 
 Net unrealized gains (losses) related to Generation s NDT funds associated with Regulatory Agreement Units are included in Regulatory liabilities on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Noncurrent payables
to affiliates on Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.    

(b) 
 Excludes $(1) million, $7 million and $29 million of net unrealized gains (losses) related to the Zion Station pledged assets in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net unrealized gains related to Zion Station
pledged assets are included in the Payable for Zion Station decommissioning on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.    

(c) 
 Net unrealized gains (losses) related to Generation s NDT funds with  Non-Regulatory  Agreement Units are included within Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.      Interest and dividends on NDT fund investments are recognized when
earned and are included in Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest and dividends earned on the NDT fund investments for the Regulatory Agreement Units are eliminated
within Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.     Accounting Implications
of the Regulatory Agreements with ComEd and PECO . Based on the regulatory agreement with the ICC that dictates Generation s obligations related to the shortfall or excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd
units on a   unit-by-unit   basis, as long as funds held in the NDT funds are expected to exceed the total estimated decommissioning obligation, decommissioning-related
activities, including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the NDT funds and accretion of the decommissioning obligation, are generally offset within Exelon s  
      479

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at Exelon. Likewise, ComEd has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from
Generation and corresponding regulatory liability. Should the expected value of the NDT fund for any former ComEd unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related
activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for that unit would be discontinued, the decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and
the adverse impact to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and financial position could be material. As of December 31, 2016, the NDT funds of each of the former ComEd units, except for Zion (see Zion Station
Decommissioning below), are expected to exceed the related decommissioning obligation for each of the units. For the purposes of making this determination, the decommissioning obligation referred to is different, as described below, from the
calculation used in the NRC minimum funding obligation filings based on NRC guidelines.    Based on the regulatory agreement supported by the PAPUC
that dictates Generation s rights and obligations related to the shortfall or excess of trust funds necessary for decommissioning the former PECO units, regardless of whether the funds held in the NDT funds are expected to exceed or fall short
of the total estimated decommissioning obligation, decommissioning-related activities are generally offset within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset of
decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at
Exelon. Likewise, PECO has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and a corresponding regulatory liability. Any changes to the PECO regulatory agreements could impact Exelon s and Generation s ability to offset
decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the impact to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and financial position could be material.  
 The decommissioning-related activities related to the  Non-Regulatory  Agreement Units are reflected in
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.    Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters and
Note 27 Related Party Transactions for information regarding regulatory liabilities at ComEd and PECO and intercompany balances between Generation, ComEd and PECO reflecting the obligation to refund to customers any decommissioning-related
assets in excess of the related decommissioning obligations.      Zion Station Decommissioning    
 On September 1, 2010, Generation completed an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
EnergySolutions, LLC (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions under which ZionSolutions has assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in 1998. Specifically, Generation transferred to
ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for Generation s transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and
other liabilities, excluding the obligation to  
      480  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
dispose of SNF and decommission the SNF dry storage facility, associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions will periodically request reimbursement from the Zion
Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to its decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. During 2013, EnergySolutions entered a definitive acquisition agreement and was acquired by another Company. Generation reviewed the acquisition as
it relates to the ASA to decommission Zion Station. Based on that review, Generation determined that the acquisition will not adversely impact decommissioning activities under the ASA.  
 ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursements from the Zion Station NDT funds as defined within the ASA.
Therefore, the transfer of the Zion Station assets did not qualify for asset sale accounting treatment and, as a result, the related NDT funds were reclassified to Pledged assets for Zion Station decommissioning within Generation s and
Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will continue to be measured in the same manner as prior to the completion of the transaction. Additionally, the transferred ARO for decommissioning was replaced with a Payable for Zion Station
decommissioning in Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the value of the Zion Station NDT assets, net of applicable taxes, will be recorded as a change in the Payable to ZionSolutions. At no point will the
payable to ZionSolutions exceed the project budget of the costs remaining to decommission Zion Station. Generation has retained its obligation for the SNF. Following ZionSolutions  completion of its contractual obligations and transfer of the
NRC license to Generation, Generation will store the SNF at Zion Station until it is transferred to the DOE for ultimate disposal, and will complete all remaining decommissioning activities associated with the SNF dry storage facility. Generation
has a liability of approximately $111 million, which is included within the nuclear decommissioning ARO at December 31, 2016. Generation also has retained NDT assets to fund its obligation to maintain the SNF at Zion Station until transfer
to the DOE and to complete all remaining decommissioning activities for the SNF storage facility. Any shortage of funds necessary to maintain the SNF and decommission the SNF storage facility is ultimately required to be funded by Generation. Any
Zion Station NDT funds remaining after the completion of all decommissioning activities will be returned to ComEd customers in accordance with the applicable orders. The following table provides the pledged assets and payables to ZionSolutions, and
withdrawals by ZionSolutions at December 31, 2016 and 2015:      

(a) 
 Excludes a liability recorded within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the tax obligation on the unrealized activity associated with the Zion Station NDT Funds. The NDT Funds
will be utilized to satisfy the tax obligations as gains and losses are realized.    

(b) 
 Included in Other current liabilities within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.    

(c) 
 Includes project expenses to decommission Zion Station and estimated tax payments on Zion Station NDT fund earnings.    
 ZionSolutions leased the land associated with Zion Station from Generation pursuant to a Lease Agreement. Under the Lease Agreement, ZionSolutions has
committed to complete the required decommissioning work according to an established schedule and constructed a dry cask storage facility on the land and has loaded the SNF from the SNF pools onto the dry cask storage facility at Zion Station. Rent
payable under the Lease Agreement is $1.00 per year, although the Lease Agreement requires ZionSolutions to pay property taxes associated with Zion Station and penalty rents  
      481

may accrue if there are unexcused delays in the progress of decommissioning work at Zion Station or the construction of the dry cask SNF storage facility. To reduce the risk of default by
ZionSolutions, EnergySolutions provided a $200 million letter of credit to be used to fund decommissioning costs in the event the NDT assets are insufficient. In accordance with the terms of the ASA, the letter of credit was reduced to
$173 million in November 2016 due to the completion of key decommissioning milestones. EnergySolutions and its parent company have also provided a performance guarantee and EnergySolutions has entered into other agreements that will provide
rights and remedies for Generation and the NRC in the case of other specified events of default, including a special purpose easement for disposal capacity at the EnergySolutions site in Clive, Utah, for all LLRW volume of Zion Station.  
   NRC Minimum Funding Requirements      NRC regulations
require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts to decommission the facility at the end of its life. The estimated decommissioning obligations as
calculated using the NRC methodology differ from the ARO recorded on Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily due to differences in the type of costs included in the estimates, the basis for estimating such costs,
and assumptions regarding the decommissioning alternatives to be used, potential license renewals, decommissioning cost escalation, and the growth rate in the NDT funds. Under NRC regulations, if the minimum funding requirements calculated under the
NRC methodology are less than the future value of the NDT funds, also calculated under the NRC methodology, then the NRC requires either further funding or other financial guarantees.  
 Key assumptions used in the minimum funding calculation using the NRC methodology at December 31, 2016 include: (1) consideration of costs
only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit; (2) the option on a   unit-by-unit   basis to use generic,
 non-site  specific cost estimates; (3) consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit; (4) the plants cease operation at the end of their current license lives (with no assumed
license renewals for those units that have not already received renewals and with an assumed   end-of-operations   date of 2019 for Oyster Creek); (5) the assumption of
current nominal dollar cost estimates that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning, nor discounted using the CARFR; and (6) assumed annual  after-tax  returns on the NDT
funds of 2% (3% for the former PECO units, as specified by the PAPUC).    In contrast, the key criteria and assumptions used by Generation to
determine the ARO and to forecast the target growth in the NDT funds at December 31, 2016 include: (1) the use of site specific cost estimates that are updated at least once every five years; (2) the inclusion in the ARO estimate of
all legally unavoidable costs required to decommission the unit (e.g., radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain units,  on-site  spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing
operations and until DOE acceptance, and disposal of certain  low-level  radioactive waste); (3) the consideration of multiple scenarios where decommissioning and site restoration activities, as applicable, are
completed under four possible scenarios ranging from 10 to 70 years after the cessation of plant operations; (4) the consideration of multiple end of life scenarios; (5) the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future
estimated costs and an annual average accretion of the ARO of approximately 5% through a period of approximately 30 years after the end of the extended lives of the units; and (6) an estimated targeted annual
 pre-tax  return on the NDT funds of 5.3% to 5.9% (as compared to a historical  5-year  annual average  pre-tax  return of
approximately 8%).

  Generation is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for units that have
been retired or are within five years of the current approved license life), based on values as of December 31, addressing Generation s ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels. Depending on the value of the trust funds, Generation
may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately
funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Exelon s and Generation s cash flows and financial position may be significantly adversely affected.  
 Generation filed its biennial decommissioning funding status report with the NRC on March 31, 2015. This report reflects the status of
decommissioning funding assurance for all units as of December 31, 2014. Due to increased cost estimates received in the second half of 2014, Braidwood Unit 1, Braidwood Unit 2, and Byron Unit 2 did not meet the NRC s minimum funding
assurance criteria as of December 31, 2014. NRC guidance provides licensees with two years or by the time of submitting the next biennial report (on or before March 31, 2017) to resolve funding assurance shortfalls. On February 4,
2016, Generation submitted an updated decommissioning funding status report with the NRC for Braidwood Units 1 and 2, and Byron Unit 2. This report reflected the approved license renewals for these units, and showed adequate decommissioning funding
assurance for each of the three units.    On March 31, 2016, Generation submitted its NRC required annual decommissioning funding status report
as of December 31, 2015 for reactors that have been shut down or are within five years of shut down (Dresden Unit 1, Oyster Creek, Zion and Peach Bottom Unit 1), except for Zion Station which is included in a separate report to the NRC
submitted by EnergySolutions (see Zion Station Decommissioning above). The status report demonstrated adequate decommissioning funding assurance for all these units except for Peach Bottom Unit 1. As a former PECO plant, financial assurance for
decommissioning Peach Bottom Unit 1 is provided by the NDT fund in addition to collections from PECO ratepayers. As discussed under Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments above, the amount collected from PECO ratepayers will be adjusted in
the next filing to the PAPUC with new rates effective January 1, 2018.    Generation will file its next decommissioning funding status report
with the NRC by March 31, 2017. This report will reflect the status of decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2016.    As the
future values of trust funds change due to market conditions, the NRC minimum funding status of Generation s units will change. In addition, if changes occur to the regulatory agreement with the PAPUC that currently allows amounts to be
collected from PECO customers for decommissioning the former PECO units, the NRC minimum funding status of those plants could change at subsequent NRC filing dates.  
   Non-Nuclear  Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)   
 Generation has AROs for plant closure costs associated with its fossil and renewable generating facilities, including asbestos abatement, removal of
certain storage tanks, restoring leased land to the condition it was in prior to construction of renewable generating stations and other decommissioning-related activities. PHI and the Utility Registrants have AROs primarily associated with the
abatement and disposal of equipment and buildings contaminated with asbestos and PCBs. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the Registrants  accounting policy for AROs.

  The following table provides a rollforward of the  non-nuclear 
AROs reflected on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016:      

(a) 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, Generation recorded an increase of $1 million in Operating and maintenance expense. ComEd, PECO and BGE did not record any adjustments in Operating and maintenance
expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Generation recorded a decrease of $(2) million in Operating and maintenance expense. ComEd, PECO and BGE did not record any adjustments in Operating and
maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.    

(b) 
 Relates to new AROs recorded due to the construction of solar, wind and other  non-nuclear  generating sites.    

(c) 
 For ComEd, PECO, and BGE, the majority of the accretion is recorded as an increase to a regulatory asset due to the associated regulatory treatment.    

(d) 
 Reflects a reduction to the ARO resulting primarily from the sales of the New Boston generating site and Upstream business in 2016 and Schuylkill generating station in 2015. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and
Dispositions for further information.    

(e) 
 Excludes $1 million, $2 million and $3 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2016 for Generation, ComEd and BGE, respectively. Excludes $5 million, $2 million and
$1 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2015 for Generation, ComEd and BGE, respectively. This is included in Other current liabilities on the Registrants  respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Following the completion of the PHI merger on March 23, 2016, PHI s AROs related to its unregulated business interests were transferred to Exelon and Generation.    
    17. Retirement Benefits (All Registrants)   
 As of December 31, 2016, Exelon sponsored defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for essentially all employees.  
 Effective March 23, 2016, Exelon became the sponsor of all of PHI s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and
assumed PHI s benefit plan obligations and related assets. As a result, PHI s benefit plan net obligation and related regulatory assets were transferred to Exelon and remeasured at the merger date using current assumptions, including
discount rates.    The table below shows the pension and other postretirement benefit plans in which employees of each operating company participated

  Exelon s traditional and cash balance pension plans are intended to be  tax-qualified  defined benefit plans. Substantially all  non-union  employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance
pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly-hired union-represented employees participate in cash balance pension plans. Exelon has elected that the trusts underlying these plans be treated as qualified trusts under the
IRC. If certain conditions are met, Exelon can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts, subject to certain IRC limitations.      Benefit Obligations, Plan
Assets and Funded Status      Exelon recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or
liability on its balance sheet, with offsetting entries to AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities), in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance. The measurement date for the plans is December 31.  
 During the first quarter of 2016, Exelon received an updated valuation of its legacy Exelon, CEG and CENG pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations to reflect actual census data as of January 1, 2016. This valuation resulted in an increase to the pension obligation of $35 million and a decrease to the other postretirement benefit obligation of $8 million.
Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $2 million (after tax), regulatory assets increased by approximately $27 million, and regulatory liabilities increased by approximately $3 million.  
 The legacy PHI pension and other postretirement benefit plans were initially remeasured on February 29, 2016 as a result of the short time between
the merger close and the end of the first quarter of 2016, using current assumptions, including the discount rate. Exelon updated these amounts in the second quarter of 2016 to reflect assumptions at March 31, 2016 resulting in a
$25 million reduction in the net obligation.

 Effective March 23, 2016, Exelon became the sponsor of PHI s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and assumed PHI s benefit plan obligations and related assets.
     The funded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations refers to the difference between plan assets and
estimated obligations of the plan. The funded status changes over time due to several factors, including contribution levels, assumed discount rates and actual returns on plan assets.  
 The following tables provide the projected benefit obligations (PBO), accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), and fair value of plan assets for all
pension plans with a PBO or ABO in excess of plan assets.      
     
   On a PBO basis, the Exelon plans were funded at 80% and 81% at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, and the PHI plans were funded at 81% at December 31, 2015. On an ABO basis, the Exelon plans were funded at 84% and 85% at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the PHI plans were funded at 89% at
December 31, 2015. The ABO differs from the PBO in that the ABO includes no assumption about future compensation levels.      Components of Net Periodic
Benefit Costs      The majority of the 2016 pension benefit cost for the legacy Exelon, CEG and CENG plans is calculated using an expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% and a discount rate of 4.29%. The majority of the 2016 other postretirement benefit cost for the legacy Exelon, CEG and CENG plans is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets of 6.71% for funded plans and a discount rate of 4.29%. The majority of the 2016 pension benefit cost of the legacy PHI plans is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50% and a discount rate of 3.96%. The
2016 other postretirement benefit cost for the legacy PHI plan is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% and a discount rate of 3.80%.

   The
following table provides the components of gross accumulated other comprehensive loss and regulatory assets (liabilities) that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit cost at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for all
plans combined:      

(a) 
 Effective March 23, 2016, Exelon became the sponsor of PHI s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and assumed PHI s benefit plan obligations and related assets.    
 The following table provides the impact to Exelon s AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2016 as a result of the
components of periodic benefit costs that are expected to be amortized in 2017. These estimates are subject to the completion of an actuarial valuation of Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which will reflect actual
census data as of January 1, 2017 and actual claims activity as of December 31, 2016. The valuation is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017 for the majority of the benefit plans.  

Assumptions      The measurement of the plan obligations
and costs of providing benefits under Exelon s defined benefit and other postretirement plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. The measurement of benefit
obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions and inputs, including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term EROA, Exelon s expected level of contributions to the plans, the long-term expected investment rate
credited to employees participating in cash balance plans and the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs. Additionally, assumptions related to plan participants include the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period,
the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age and length of service, among other factors. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations.  
      493  

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
   Expected Rate of Return.  In selecting the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic indicators
(including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectations regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon s target asset class allocations.  
  Mortality.  For the December 31, 2014 actuarial valuation, Exelon changed its assumption of mortality to reflect more recent expectations of
future improvements in life expectancy. The change was supported through completion of an experience study and supplemental analyses performed by Exelon s actuaries. The change in assumption resulted in increases of $361 million and
$117 million in the pension and other postretirement benefits obligations as of December 31, 2014, respectively. There were no changes to the mortality assumption in 2015 or 2016.  
 The following assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the plans at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Assumptions used to
determine  year-end  benefit obligations are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year s net periodic benefit costs.

(c) 
 PHISCO s pension contributions for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $4 million of contributions made prior to the closing of Exelon s merger with PHI on March 23, 2016.
     Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution
requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and  at-risk  status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act), management of the pension obligation and regulatory
implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and  at-risk  status (which
triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). Additionally, the projected contribution reflects a funding strategy for the

legacy Exelon, CEG and CENG plans of contributing the greater of $250 million until the qualified plans are fully funded on an ABO basis, and the minimum amounts under ERISA to avoid benefit
restrictions and  at-risk  status. This level funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. Contributions to the PHI qualified pension plan are $60 million.  
 The following table provides all registrants  planned contributions to the qualified pension plans, planned benefit payments to  non-qualified  pension plans, and planned contributions to other postretirement plans in 2017:      

(a) 
 Exelon s and Generation s expected qualified pension plan contributions above include $21 million related to the legacy CENG plans that will be funded by CENG as provided in an EMA between Exelon and
CENG.    

(b) 
 Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon s  non-qualified  pension plans are not funded.    

(c) 
 Unlike the qualified pension plans, other postretirement plans are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements. OPEB funding generally follows accounting costs however, Exelon s management has
historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet
regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery). These amounts include benefit payments related to unfunded plans.        Estimated

pension and postretirement liabilities, for the legacy Exelon plans were allocated by Exelon to its subsidiaries based on the number of active employees as of January 1, 2001 as part of
Exelon s corporate restructuring. The obligation for Generation, ComEd and PECO reflects the initial allocation and the cumulative costs incurred and contributions made since January 1, 2001. Historically, Exelon has allocated the
components of pension and other postretirement costs to the subsidiaries in the legacy Exelon plans based upon several factors, including the measures of active employee participation in each plan. Pension and other postretirement benefit
contributions were allocated to legacy Exelon subsidiaries in proportion to active service costs recognized and total costs recognized, respectively. Beginning in 2015, Exelon began allocating costs related to its legacy Exelon pension and other
postretirement benefit plans to its subsidiaries based on both active and retired employee participation and contributions are allocated based on accounting cost. The impact of this allocation methodology change was not material to any Registrant.
For legacy CEG, legacy CENG, and legacy PHI plans, components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and contributions have been, and will continue to be, allocated to the subsidiaries based on employee participation (both active and
retired).    The amounts below were included in capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expense for the years ended December 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively, for each of the entities allocated portion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. These amounts include the recognized contractual termination benefit charges, curtailment gains, and settlement
charges:      

(a) 
 These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations. These amounts are not included in the Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL or ACE amounts above.

(b) 
 Pepco s, DPL s, ACE s and PHISCO s pension and postretirement benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $7 million, $4 million, $3 million and $9 million,
respectively, of costs incurred prior to the closing of Exelon s merger with PHI on March 23, 2016.        Plan Assets    
  Investment Strategy.  On a regular basis, Exelon evaluates its investment strategy to ensure that plan assets will be sufficient to pay plan
benefits when due. As part of this ongoing evaluation, Exelon may make changes to its targeted asset allocation and investment strategy.    Exelon has
developed and implemented a liability hedging investment strategy for its qualified pension plans that has reduced the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Exelon is likely to continue to gradually increase the
liability hedging portfolio as the funded status of its plans improves. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns that will balance the liquidity requirements of the plans  liabilities while striving to minimize the
risk of significant losses.

Trust assets for Exelon s other postretirement plans are managed in a diversified investment strategy that prioritizes maximizing liquidity and returns while minimizing asset volatility.
   Exelon used an EROA of 7.00% and 6.60% to estimate its 2017 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.  
 Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plan target asset allocations at December 31, 2016 and 2015 asset allocations were as
follows:     Pension Plans       
    Other Postretirement Benefit Plans       

(a) 
 Alternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and private credit.    
  Concentrations of Credit Risk.  Exelon evaluated its pension and other postretirement benefit plans  asset portfolios for the existence of
significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2016. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual
fund. As of December 31, 2016, there were no significant concentrations (defined as greater than 10% of plan assets) of risk in Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets.

  The following table presents the reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair
value for pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:     Exelon   

(a) 
 Represents cash settlements only.      There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and
Level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets.     Valuation Techniques Used to Determine
Fair Value      Cash equivalents .   Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term
fixed income securities and money market funds, are considered cash equivalents. The fair values are based on observable market prices and, therefore, are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.  
  Equities .   Equities consist of individually held equity securities, equity mutual funds and equity commingled funds in domestic and foreign
markets. With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Exelon is able to independently corroborate. Equity securities
held individually, including real estate investment trusts, rights and warrants, are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed
 
      504

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
by these exchanges. Equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1. Certain private placement equity securities are categorized as
Level 3 because they are not publicly traded and are priced using significant unobservable inputs.    Equity commingled funds and mutual funds
are maintained by investment companies that hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with the plans  overall investment strategy. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted.
For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For equity commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators
value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly with 30 or less
days of notice and without further restrictions.     Fixed income .   For fixed income securities, which consist primarily of corporate debt
securities, foreign government securities, municipal bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, commingled funds, mutual funds and derivative instruments, the trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables
cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each security. With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the trustees monitor
prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is
considered to be preferable. Exelon has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Exelon selectively corroborates the fair values of
securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain private placement fixed income
securities have been categorized as Level 3 because they are priced using certain significant unobservable inputs and are typically illiquid. The remaining fixed income securities, including certain other fixed income investments, are based on
evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as Level 2.  
 Other fixed income investments primarily consist of fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds, which are maintained by investment companies and
hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the
funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund
share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly with 30 or less days of notice and without further
restrictions.    Derivative instruments consisting primarily of futures and interest rate swaps to manage risk are recorded at fair value. Over the
counter derivatives are valued daily based on quoted prices in active markets and trade in open markets, and have been categorized as Level 1. Derivative instruments other than over the counter derivatives are valued based on external price data of
comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.

   Private equity .   Private equity investments include those in limited partnerships that
invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange such as leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments and investments in natural resources. Private equity valuations are reported by the
fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include unobservable inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. The fair value of private equity investments
is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.  
  Hedge funds .   Hedge fund investments include those seeking to maximize absolute returns using a broad range of strategies to enhance
returns and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, hedge funds are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Exelon has the ability
to redeem these investments at NAV or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions which may include a  lock-up  period or a gate.  
  Real estate .   Real estate funds are funds with a direct investment in pools of real estate properties. These funds are valued by investment
managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use independent appraisals from sources with professional qualifications. These valuation inputs are not highly observable. The fair value of real estate investments is determined using NAV or
its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.     Private credit.
 Private credit investments primarily consist of limited partnerships that invest in private debt strategies. These investments are generally less liquid assets with an underlying term of 3 to 5 years and are intended to be held to
maturity. The fair value of these investments is determined by the fund manager or administrator and include unobservable inputs such as cost, operating results, and discounted cash flows. The fair value of private credit investments is
determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.     Defined
Contribution Savings Plan (All Registrants)     The Registrants participate in various 401(k) defined contribution savings plans that are sponsored
by Exelon. The plans are qualified under applicable sections of the IRC and allow employees to contribute a portion of their  pre-tax  and  after-tax  income in accordance
with specified guidelines. All Registrants match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. The following table presents matching contributions to the savings plan for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

(b) 
 These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations. These costs are not included in the Generation, ComEd, PECO, or BGE amounts above.    

(c) 
 Pepco s, DPL s and PHISCO s matching contributions include $1 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively, of costs incurred prior to the closing of Exelon s merger with PHI on
March 23, 2016, which is not included in Exelon s matching contributions at December 31, 2016.         18.
Severance (All Registrants)     The Registrants have an ongoing severance plan under which, in general, the longer an employee worked prior to
termination the greater the amount of severance benefits. The Registrants record a liability and expense or regulatory asset for severance once terminations are probable of occurrence and the related severance benefits can be reasonably estimated.
For severance benefits that are incremental to its ongoing severance plan  ( one-time  termination benefits ), the Registrants measure the obligation and record the expense at fair value at the
communication date if there are no future service requirements, or, if future service is required to receive the termination benefit, ratably over the required service period.  
  Ongoing Severance Plans     The Registrants provide severance
and health and welfare benefits under Exelon s ongoing severance benefit plans to terminated employees in the normal course of business. These benefits are accrued for when the benefits are considered probable and can be reasonably
estimated.    For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Registrants recorded the following severance costs associated with ongoing
severance benefits within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income:      

(a) 
 The amounts above for Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE and PHI include immaterial amounts billed by BSC for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.    
  Early Plant Retirement-Related Severance     On December 7,
2016 the Future Energy Jobs Bill was signed into law by the Governor of Illinois and included a ZES. With the passage of the IL ZES, Generation reversed its decision to permanently cease generation operations at the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear
generating plants and expects the

plants to continue operation for at least another 10 years. As a result, Exelon and Generation reversed the associated severance benefit costs of $44 million in December 2016 which were
previously recorded for expected employee severances.     Cost Management Program-Related Severance   
 In August 2015, Exelon announced a cost management program focused on cost savings at BSC and Generation, including the elimination of approximately 500
positions. These actions are in response to the continuing economic challenges confronting all parts of Exelon s business and industry, necessitating continued focus on cost management through enhanced efficiency and productivity. Exelon
expects that approximately 250 corporate support positions in BSC and approximately 250 positions located throughout Generation will be eliminated. The final amount of the severance charges related to the cost management program will ultimately
depend on the specific employees severed.    For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Registrants recorded the following severance costs related
to the cost management program within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, pursuant to the authoritative guidance for ongoing severance plans:  

(a) 
 The amounts above for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE include $7 million, $3 million, $1 million, and $1 million, respectively, for amounts billed by BSC through intercompany allocations for the year
ended December 31, 2016.       Severance Costs Related to the PHI Merger   
 Upon closing the PHI Merger, Exelon recorded a severance accrual for the anticipated employee position reductions as a result of the post-merger
integration. Cash payments under the plan began in May 2016 and will continue through 2020.    For the year ended December 31, 2016, the
Registrants recorded the following severance costs associated with the identified job reductions within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, pursuant to the authoritative guidance
for ongoing severance plans:      

(a) 
 The amounts above for Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE include $8 million, $2 million, $1 million, $1 million, $20 million, $12 million and $10 million, respectively,
for amounts billed by BSC and/or PHISCO through intercompany allocations for the year ended December 31, 2016.    

(b) 
 Pepco established a regulatory asset of $11 million as of December 31, 2016, primarily for severance benefit costs related to the PHI merger.    

(c) 
 DPL established a regulatory asset of $4 million as of December 31, 2016, primarily for severance benefit costs related to the PHI merger.

 Includes salary continuance and health and welfare severance benefits. Amounts primarily represent benefits provided for the PHI post-merger integration and the cost management program.    
 
    19. Mezzanine Equity (Exelon, Generation and PHI)   
  Contingently Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests (Exelon and Generation)   
 In November 2015, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into an arrangement to sell a portion of its equity to a tax
equity investor. Pursuant to the operating agreement, in certain circumstances the equity contributed by the noncontrolling interests holder could be contingently redeemable. These circumstances are outside of the control of Generation and the
noncontrolling interests holder resulting in a portion of the noncontrolling interests being considered contingently redeemable and thus presented in mezzanine equity on the consolidated balance sheet.  
 The following table summarizes the changes in the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

   Preferred Stock (PHI)   
 In connection with the PHI Merger Agreement, Exelon purchased 18,000 originally issued shares of PHI preferred stock for a purchase price of
$180 million. PHI excluded the preferred stock from equity at December 31, 2015 since the preferred stock contained conditions for redemption that were not solely within the control of PHI. Management determined that the preferred stock
contained embedded features requiring separate accounting consideration to reflect the potential value to PHI that any issued and outstanding preferred stock could be called and redeemed at a nominal par value upon a termination of the merger
agreement under certain circumstances due to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. The embedded call and redemption features on the shares of the preferred stock in the event of such a termination were separately accounted for as
derivatives. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the derivative related to the preferred stock was estimated to be $18 million based on PHI s updated assessment and was included in current assets with a corresponding increase
in preferred stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Immediately prior to the merger date, PHI updated its assessment of the fair value of the derivative and reduced the fair value to zero, recording the $18 million decrease in fair value as a
reduction of Other, within PHI s predecessor period, January 1, 2016 to March 23, 2016, Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
 On March 23, 2016, the preferred stock was cancelled and the $180 million cash consideration previously received by PHI to issue the preferred
stock was treated as additional merger purchase price consideration.       20. Shareholders  Equity (Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI,
Pepco, DPL and ACE)     The following table presents common stock authorized and outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:  
   
   ComEd had 72,859 and 73,434 warrants outstanding to purchase ComEd common stock at December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The warrants entitle the holders to convert such warrants into common stock of ComEd at a conversion rate of one share of common stock for three warrants. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, 24,286 and 24,478 shares of common stock,
respectively, were reserved for the conversion of warrants.     Equity Securities Offering   
 In June 2014, Exelon marketed an equity offering of 57.5 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $35 per share. In
connection with such offering, Exelon entered into forward  
      510

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
sale agreements with two counterparties. In July 2015, Exelon settled the forward sale agreement by the issuance of 57.5 million shares of Exelon common stock. Exelon received net cash
proceeds of $1.87 billion, which was calculated based on a forward price of $32.48 per share as specified in the forward sale agreements. The net proceeds were used to fund the merger with PHI and related costs and expenses, and for general
corporate purposes. The forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions. As a result, no amounts were recorded in the consolidated financial statements until the July 2015 settlement of the forward sale agreements. However, prior to
the July 2015 settlement, incremental shares, if any, were included within the calculation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.  
 Concurrent with the forward equity transaction, Exelon also issued $1.15 billion of junior subordinated notes in the form of 23 million equity
units. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for further information on the equity units.     Share Repurchases   
  Share Repurchase Programs . There currently is no Exelon Board of Director authority to repurchase shares. Any previous shares repurchased are held
as treasury shares, at cost, unless cancelled or reissued at the discretion of Exelon s management. Under the previous share repurchase programs, 35 million shares of common stock are held as treasury stock with a cost of $2.3 billion
at December 31, 2016. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, Exelon had no common stock repurchases.     Preferred and Preference Securities of Subsidiaries   
 At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Exelon was authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred securities, none of which were outstanding.  
 At December 31, 2016 and 2015, ComEd prior preferred securities and ComEd cumulative preference securities consisted of 850,000 shares and
6,810,451 shares authorized, respectively, none of which were outstanding.    On July 3, 2016, BGE redeemed all 400,000 shares of its outstanding
7.125% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1993 Series and all 600,000 shares of its outstanding 6.990% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1995 Series for $100 million, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. On September 18, 2016, BGE redeemed the
remaining 500,000 shares of its outstanding 6.970% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1993 Series and the remaining 400,000 shares of its outstanding 6.700% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1993 Series for $90 million, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, BGE cumulative preference stock, $100 par value, consisted of 6,500,000 shares authorized and the outstanding amounts set forth in the table below. Shares of BGE preference stock have no voting power except for
the following:      

The preference stock has one vote per share on any charter amendment that i) with regards to either dividends or distribution of assets, would create or authorize any shares of stock ranking prior to or on a parity with
the preference stock or ii) substantially adversely affect the contract rights, as expressly set forth in BGE s charter, of the preference stock. Each such amendment would require the affirmative vote of
 two-thirds  of all the shares of preference stock outstanding; and        

Whenever BGE fails to pay full dividends on the preference stock and such failure continues for one year, the preference
stock shall have one vote per share on all matters, until and     
      511

unless such dividends shall have been paid in full. Upon liquidation, the holders of the preference stock of each series outstanding are entitled to receive the par amount of their shares and an
amount equal to the unpaid accrued dividends.

 Redeemable, at the option of BGE, at the indicated dollar amounts per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.        
 21. Stock-Based Compensation Plans (All Registrants)      Stock-Based Compensation Plans   
 Exelon grants stock-based awards through its LTIP, which primarily includes stock options, restricted stock units and performance share awards. At
December 31, 2016, there were approximately 14 million shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, exercised and distributed stock-based awards were primarily issued from
authorized but unissued common stock shares.    Beginning in 2014, ComEd, PECO and BGE grant cash awards. The following tables do not include expense
related to these plans as they are not considered stock-based compensation plans under the applicable accounting guidance.    In connection with the
acquisition of PHI in March 2016, PHI s unvested time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units issued prior to April 29, 2014 were immediately vested and paid in cash upon the close of the
merger. PHI s remaining unvested time-based restricted stock units as of the close of the merger were cancelled. There were no remaining unvested performance-based restricted stock units as of the close of the merger.

 These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations. These amounts are not included in the Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE or PHI amounts above.

There were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for Exelon or PHI, or
for PHI during the predecessor period January 1, 2016 to March 23, 2016.    Exelon and PHI receive a tax deduction based on the intrinsic
value of the award on the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for performance share awards and restricted stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, Exelon and PHI recognize the tax benefit related to
compensation costs. The following tables present information regarding Exelon s and PHI s tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and PHI s predecessor period January 1, 2016 to March 23, 2016:

    Stock Options   
  Non-qualified  stock options to purchase shares of Exelon s common stock were granted under the LTIP through
2012. Due to changes in the LTIP, there were no stock options granted in 2014, 2015 or 2016. For all stock options granted through 2012, the exercise price of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of
option grant. The vesting period of stock options is generally four years. As of December 31, 2016 all stock options are fully vested. All stock options expire ten years from the date of grant.  
 The value of stock options at the date of grant is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service
period for stock options is generally four years.

However, certain stock options become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement-eligibility. The value of the stock options granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized
immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility.    The following table presents
information with respect to stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2016:

   Restricted Stock Units   
 Restricted stock units are granted under the LTIP with the majority being settled in a specific number of shares of common stock after the service
condition has been met. The corresponding cost of services is measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued.    The
value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally three to five years. However, certain restricted stock unit awards
become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement-eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee
reaches retirement eligibility. Exelon uses historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary.  
 The following tables summarize Exelon s and PHI s nonvested restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 and

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Exelon had obligations related to outstanding restricted stock units not yet settled of $101 million and $97 million, respectively, which are
included in common stock in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Exelon settled restricted stock units with fair value totaling $68 million, $75 million and $43 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2016, $58 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 2 years.  
 For PHI, the weighted average grant date fair value (per share) of time-based restricted stock units granted for the years ended December 31, 2015
and 2014 was $27.40 and $19.77, respectively, and for performance-based restricted stock units was $26.08 and $18.53 for the same periods, respectively. At December 31, 2015 PHI had obligations related to outstanding time-based and
performance-based restricted stock units not yet settled of $1 million each, which are included in common stock in PHI s Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, PHI settled time-based restricted
stock units with fair value totaling $6 million and $8 million, respectively, and settled performance-based restricted stock units with fair value totaling $15 million and $9 million, for the same periods, respectively. There
were no settled restricted stock units for the predecessor period January 1, 2016 to March 23, 2016.     Performance Share Awards   
 Performance share awards are granted under the LTIP. The performance share awards are being settled 50% in common stock and 50% in cash at the end of the
three-year performance period, except for awards granted to vice presidents and higher officers that may be settled 100% in common stock, 100% in cash or 50%in common stock and 50% in cash if certain ownership requirements are satisfied.  
 The common stock portion of the performance share is considered an equity award and is valued based on Exelon s stock price on the grant date. The
cash portion of the awards is considered a liability award which is remeasured each reporting period based on Exelon s current stock price. As the value of the common stock and cash portions of the awards are based on Exelon s stock price
during the performance period, coupled with changes in the total shareholder return modifier and expected payout of the award, the compensation costs are subject to volatility until payout is established.  
 For nonretirement-eligible employees, stock-based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period of three years using the graded-vesting
method. For performance share awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant.

    22. Earnings Per Share (Exelon)   
 Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing Net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding, including shares to be issued upon exercise of stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock outstanding under Exelon s LTIPs considered to be common stock equivalents. The following table sets forth the
components of basic and diluted earnings per share and shows the effect of the stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock on the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per share:  
   
   The number of stock options not included in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to their
antidilutive effect was approximately 12 million in 2016, 16 million in 2015, and 17 million in 2014. There were no equity units related to the PHI merger not included in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to
their antidilutive effect for the year ended December 31, 2016. The number of equity units related to the PHI merger not included in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to their antidilutive effect were 3 million and
less than 1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Refer to Note 20 Shareholders  Equity for further information regarding the equity units and equity forward units.  
 Under share repurchase programs, 35 million shares of common stock are held as treasury stock with a cost of $2.3 billion as of
December 31, 2016. In 2008, Exelon management decided to defer indefinitely any share repurchases.

      24. Commitments and Contingencies (All Registrants)   
  Commitments       Constellation Merger Commitments
     In February 2012, the MDPSC issued an Order approving the Exelon and Constellation merger. As part of the MDPSC Order, Exelon agreed to
provide a package of benefits to BGE customers, the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, resulting in an estimated direct investment in the State of Maryland of approximately $1 billion. The direct investment estimate includes
$95 million to $120 million relating to the construction of a headquarters building in Baltimore for Generation s competitive energy businesses.  
 The direct investment commitment also includes $450 million to $500 million relating to Exelon and Generation s development or assistance
in the development of 285 300 MWs of new generation in Maryland, which is expected to be completed within a period of 10 years. The MDPSC order contemplates various options for complying with the new generation development commitments,
including building or acquiring generating assets, making subsidy or compliance payments, or in circumstances in which the generation build is delayed or certain specified provisions are elected, making liquidated damages payments. Exelon and
Generation have incurred $454 million towards satisfying the commitment for new generation development in the state of Maryland, with approximately 220 MW of the new generation commencing with commercial operations to date. During the third
quarter of 2014, the conditions associated with one of the generation development commitments changed such that the most likely outcome would involve Exelon and Generation making subsidy payments and/or liquidated damages payments rather than
constructing the specified generating plant. As a result, Exelon and Generation recorded a  pre-tax  $44 million loss contingency in Operating and maintenance expense related to this specific commitment
that is included in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. On December 19, 2016, Generation paid $44 million to the Maryland Energy
Administration in full satisfaction of this commitment. During the fourth quarter of 2016, given continued declines in projected energy and capacity prices, Generation terminated rights to certain development projects originally intended to meet its
remaining 55 MW commitment amount. The commitment will now most likely be satisfied via payment of liquidated damages or execution of a third party PPA, rather than by Generation constructing renewable generating assets. As a result, Exelon and
Generation recorded a  pre-tax  $50 million loss contingency in Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for
the year ended December 31, 2016.      Equity Investment Commitments    
 As part of Generation s recent investments in technology development, Generation enters into equity purchase agreements that include commitments to
invest additional equity through incremental payments to fund the anticipated needs of the planned operations of the associated companies. The commitment includes approximately $20 million of  in-kind 
services and 100% of 2015 ESA Investco,

  Nuclear Insurance     Generation is subject to liability,
property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations, including the CENG nuclear stations. Generation has mitigated its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing
provisions.    The Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an incident at any of
the U.S. licensed nuclear facilities and also to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident. As of December 31, 2016, the current liability limit per incident is $13.4 billion and is subject to
change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors at least once every five years with the last adjustment effective September 10, 2013. In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, Generation maintains
financial protection at levels equal to the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for public liability claims that could arise in the event of an incident.
Effective January 1, 2017, the required amount of nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is $450 million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection
pool, as required by the Price  Anderson-Act,  which provides the additional $13.0 billion per incident in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this secondary financial protection
pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of costs for any single incident that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Exelon s share of this secondary layer would be approximately $2.7 billion,
including CENG s related liability, however any amounts payable under this secondary layer would be capped at $400 million per year.    In
addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the $13.4 billion limit for a single incident.

  As part of the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement
pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF and its affiliates against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations.
Exelon guarantees Generation s obligations under this indemnity. See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for additional information on Generation s operations relating to CENG.  
 Generation is required each year to report to the NRC the current levels and sources of property insurance that demonstrates Generation possesses
sufficient financial resources to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The property insurance maintained for each facility is currently provided through insurance policies purchased from NEIL,
an industry mutual insurance company of which Generation is a member.    NEIL may declare distributions to its members as a result of favorable
operating experience. In recent years NEIL has made distributions to its members, but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will continue at all. Generation s portion of the distribution declared by NEIL is
estimated to be $21 million for 2016, and was $21 million for 2015 and $18 million for 2014. The distributions were recorded as a reduction to Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon and Generation s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.    Premiums paid to NEIL by its members are also subject to a potential assessment for adverse loss
experience in the form of a retrospective premium obligation. NEIL has never assessed this retrospective premium since its formation in 1973, and Generation cannot predict the level of future assessments if any. The current maximum aggregate annual
retrospective premium obligation for Generation is approximately $353 million. NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit rating or to ensure collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation by providing a
financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or some other means of assurance.    NEIL provides  all risk  property damage,
decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. If the decision is made to decommission the facility, a portion of the
insurance proceeds will be allocated to a fund, which Generation is required by the NRC to maintain, to provide for decommissioning the facility. In the event of an insured loss, Generation is unable to predict the timing of the availability of
insurance proceeds to Generation and the amount of such proceeds that would be available. In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental property damage within a twelve-month period from the first accidental property damage under
one or more policies for all insured plants, the maximum recovery by Exelon will be an aggregate of $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts as the insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance, indemnity and any other source,
applicable to such losses.    For its insured losses, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed
the amount of insurance maintained. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recoverable from insurers or the nuclear industry, could also be borne by Generation. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s
and Generation s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

   Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation   
 Under the NWPA, the DOE is responsible for the development of a geologic repository for and the disposal of SNF and high-level radioactive waste. As
required by the NWPA, Generation is a party to contracts with the DOE (Standard Contracts) to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation s nuclear generating stations. In accordance with the NWPA and the Standard Contracts, Generation
historically had paid the DOE one mill ($0.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. On November 19, 2013, the D.C. Circuit Court ordered the DOE to submit to Congress a proposal to reduce the current SNF disposal fee
to zero, unless and until there is a viable disposal program. On May 9, 2014, the DOE notified Generation that the SNF disposal fee remained in effect through May 15, 2014, after which time the fee was set to zero. As a result, for the
year ended December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, Generation did not incur any expense in SNF disposal fees. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Generation incurred expense of $49 million in SNF disposal fees recorded in
Purchased power and fuel expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, including Exelon s share of Salem and net of  co-owner 
reimbursements (not including such fees incurred by CENG). Until such time as a new fee structure is in effect, Exelon and Generation will not accrue any further costs related to SNF disposal fees. This fee may be adjusted prospectively in order to
ensure full cost recovery. The NWPA and the Standard Contracts required the DOE to begin taking possession of SNF generated by nuclear generating units by no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE, however, failed to meet that deadline and its
performance has been, and is expected to be, delayed significantly.    The 2010 Federal budget (which became effective October 1, 2009)
eliminated almost all funding for the creation of the Yucca Mountain repository while the Obama Administration devised a new strategy for long-term SNF management. A Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) on America s Nuclear Future, appointed by the
U.S. Energy Secretary, released a report on January 26, 2012, detailing comprehensive recommendations for creating a safe, long-term solution for managing and disposing of the nation s SNF and high-level radioactive waste.  
 In early 2013, the DOE issued an updated  Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste  in
response to the BRC recommendations. This strategy included a consolidated interim storage facility that was planned to be operational in 2025. However, due to continued delays on the part of the DOE, Generation currently assumes the DOE will begin
accepting SNF in 2030. The SNF acceptance date assumption is based on management s estimates of the amount of time required for DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long-term SNF storage.  
 Generation uses the 2030 date as the assumed date for when the DOE will begin accepting SNF for purposes of determining nuclear decommissioning asset
retirement obligations.    In August 2004, Generation and the DOJ, in close consultation with the DOE, reached a settlement under which the government
agreed to reimburse Generation, subject to certain damage limitations based on the extent of the government s breach, for costs associated with storage of SNF at Generation s nuclear stations pending the DOE s fulfillment of its
obligations. A settlement agreement for Calvert Cliffs and Nine Mile Point was executed during 2011, pursuant to which the government agreed to reimburse the costs associated with SNF storage expended or to be expended during a term set by the
agreement. The term was subsequently extended during 2014 to include SNF storage costs incurred at Calvert Cliffs and Nine Mile Point through December 31, 2016. A DOE settlement agreement for Ginna was also executed during 2011. During 2015,
Ginna executed another DOE

settlement agreement providing for the reimbursement of SNF storage costs incurred through December 31, 2016. Generation expects the terms for each of the settlement agreements to be
extended during 2017 for another three years to cover SNF storage costs through December 31, 2019. Generation, including CENG, submits annual reimbursement requests to the DOE for costs associated with the storage of SNF. In all cases,
reimbursement requests are made only after costs are incurred and only for costs resulting from DOE delays in accepting the SNF.    Under the
settlement agreement, Generation has received cumulative cash reimbursements for costs incurred as follows:      

(a) 
 Total after considering amounts due to  co-owners  of certain nuclear stations and to the former owner of Oyster Creek.    

(b) 
 Includes $53 million and $49 million, respectively, for amounts received since April 1, 2014, for costs incurred under the CENG DOE Settlement Agreements prior to the consolidation of CENG.
     As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, the amount of SNF storage costs for which reimbursement has been or will be requested from
the DOE under the DOE settlement agreements is as follows:      

(a) 
 Recorded in Accounts receivable, other.    

(b) 
 Recorded in Deferred debits and other assets, other    

(c) 
  Non-CENG  amounts owed to  co-owners  are recorded in Accounts receivable, other. CENG amounts owed to
 co-owners  are recorded in Accounts payable. Represents amounts owed to the  co-owners  of Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, and Nine Mile Point Unit 2 generating facilities.
     The Standard Contracts with the DOE also required the payment to the DOE of a  one-time  fee
applicable to nuclear generation through April 6, 1983. The fee related to the former PECO units has been paid. Pursuant to the Standard Contracts, ComEd previously elected to defer payment of the
 one-time  fee of $277 million for its units (which are now part of Generation), with interest to the date of payment, until just prior to the first delivery of SNF to the DOE. As of December 31, 2016,
the unfunded SNF liability for the  one-time  fee with interest was $1,024 million. Interest accrues at the  13-week  Treasury Rate. The
 13-week  Treasury Rate in effect, for calculation of the interest accrual at December 31, 2016, was 0.355%. The liabilities for SNF disposal costs, including the
 one-time  fee, were transferred to Generation as part of Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring. The outstanding  one-time  fee obligations for the Nine Mile Point,
Ginna, Oyster Creek and TMI units remain with the former owners. The Clinton and Calvert Cliffs units have no outstanding obligation. See Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for additional information.  
  Environmental Remediation Matters       General.   The
Registrants  operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the
costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels,
 
      532

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the
Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future.  
 ComEd, PECO, BGE, and DPL have identified sites where former MGP activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. For almost all of
these sites, there are additional PRPs that may share responsibility for the ultimate remediation of each location.      

ComEd has identified 42 sites, 18 of which have been remediated and approved by the Illinois EPA or the U.S. EPA and 24 that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. ComEd expects the majority
of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2021.        

PECO has identified 26 sites, 17 of which have been remediated in accordance with applicable PA DEP regulatory requirements. The remaining 9 sites are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. PECO
expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2022.        

BGE has identified 13 former gas manufacturing or purification sites that it currently owns or owned at one time through a predecessor s acquisition. Two gas manufacturing sites require some level of remediation
and ongoing monitoring under the direction of the MDE. The required costs at these 2 sites are not considered material. An investigation of an additional gas purification site was completed during the first quarter of 2015 at the direction of the
MDE. For more information, see the discussion of the Riverside site below.        

DPL has identified 2 sites, all of which the remediation has been completed and approved by the MDE or the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.    
 ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, are currently recovering
environmental remediation costs of former MGP facility sites through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the associated regulatory assets. BGE is authorized to recover, and is currently recovering,
environmental costs for the remediation of the former MGP facility sites from customers; however, while BGE does not have a rider for MGP  clean-up  costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual  clean-up  costs in distribution rates. DPL has historically received recovery of actual  clean-up  costs in distribution rates.

  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Registrants had accrued the following undiscounted amounts
for environmental liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities within their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets:      
     
   The historical nature of the MGP sites and the fact that many of the sites have been buried and built over, impacts the
ability to determine a precise estimate of the ultimate costs prior to initial sampling and determination of the exact scope and method of remedial activity. Management determines its best estimate of remediation costs using all available
information at the time of each study, including probabilistic and deterministic modeling for ComEd and PECO, and the remediation standards currently required by the applicable state environmental agency. Prior to completion of any
significant clean up, each site remediation plan is approved by the appropriate state environmental agency.    During the third quarter of 2016, ComEd
and PECO completed an annual study of their future estimated MGP remediation requirements. The results of the study resulted in a $7 million and $2 million increase to environmental liabilities and related regulatory assets for ComEd and
PECO, respectively.    The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate whether they will incur other significant liabilities for additional investigation
and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants, environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties, including customers.

    Water Quality    
   Benning Road Site NPDES Permit Limit Exceedances  . Pepco holds an NPDES permit issued by EPA with a July 19, 2009 effective date, which
authorizes discharges from the Benning Road service facility. The 2009 permit for the first time imposed numerical limits on the allowable concentration of certain metals in storm water discharged from the site into the Anacostia River. The permit
contemplated that Pepco would meet these limits over time through the use of best management practices (BMPs). The BMPs were effective in reducing metal concentrations in storm water discharges, but were not sufficient to meet all of the numerical
limits for all metals.    The 2009 permit remains in effect pending EPA s action on the Pepco renewal application, including resolution of the
stormwater compliance issues. On October 30, 2015, EPA filed a Clean Water Act civil enforcement action against Pepco in federal district court, and in March 2016 the court granted a motion by the Anacostia Riverkeeper to intervene in this case
as a plaintiff along with EPA. Since 2009 Pepco has installed runoff mitigation measures and implemented new operating procedures to comply with regulations. In January 2017, the parties agreed to a settlement in the form of a Consent Decree whereby
Pepco will pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.6 million, continue the BMPs to manage stormwater, construct a new stormwater treatment system, and make certain other capital improvements to the stormwater management system. The Consent
Decree has been lodged with the Court and will be subject to a  30-day  public comment period. It is expected that the Court will approve the Consent Decree in the first quarter of 2017. Pepco has established
appropriate reserves for the liabilities under the Consent Agreement, which is included in the table above.      Solid and Hazardous Waste    
   Cotter Corporation.       The EPA has advised Cotter Corporation (Cotter), a former ComEd subsidiary, that it is potentially
liable in connection with radiological contamination at a site known as the West Lake Landfill in Missouri. In 2000, ComEd sold Cotter to an unaffiliated third-party. As part of the sale, ComEd agreed to indemnify Cotter for any liability arising in
connection with the West Lake Landfill. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, this responsibility to indemnify Cotter was transferred to Generation. On May 29, 2008, the EPA issued a Record of Decision approving the
remediation option submitted by Cotter and the two other PRPs that required additional landfill cover. The current estimated cost of the landfill cover remediation for the site is approximately $90 million including escalation, which will be
allocated among all PRPs. Generation has accrued what it believes to be an adequate amount to cover its anticipated share of such liability, which is included in the table above. By letter dated January 11, 2010, the EPA requested that the PRPs
perform a supplemental feasibility study for a remediation alternative that would involve complete excavation of the radiological contamination. On September 30, 2011, the PRPs submitted the supplemental feasibility study to the EPA for review.
Since June 2012, the EPA has requested that the PRPs perform a series of additional analyses and groundwater and soil sampling as part of the supplemental feasibility study. The final supplemental feasibility study was completed in December of 2016
and will enable the EPA to propose a remedy for public comment. While the EPA has not yet formally announced a change in the schedule, the PRPs believe that the EPA announcement of the proposed remedy will take place in the third quarter of 2017 at
the earliest. Thereafter, the EPA will select a final remedy and enter into a Consent Decree with the PRPs to effectuate the remedy. Recent investigation has identified a number of other parties who may be PRPs and could be liable to contribute to
the final remedy. Further investigation is underway. Generation believes that a partial excavation remedy is reasonably possible, and the partial excavation costs, inclusive of a landfill cover, could range from approximately $225 million
to$650 million; such costs would likely be shared by the final group of identified PRPs.  
      535

Generation believes the likelihood that the EPA would require a complete excavation remedy is remote. The cost of a partial or complete excavation could have a material, unfavorable impact on
Generation s and Exelon s future results of operations and cash flows.    During December 2015, the EPA took two actions related to the West
Lake Landfill designed to abate what it termed as imminent and dangerous conditions at the landfill. The first involved installation by the PRPs of a  non-combustible  surface cover to protect against surface
fires in areas where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. Generation has accrued what it believes to be an adequate amount to cover its anticipated liability for this interim action. The second action involved EPA s public
statement that it will require the PRPs to construct a barrier wall in an adjacent landfill to prevent a subsurface fire from spreading to those areas of the West Lake Landfill where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. At this
time, EPA has not provided sufficient details related to the basis for and the requirements and design of a barrier wall to enable Generation to determine the likelihood such a remedy will ultimately be implemented, assess the degree to which
Generation may have liability as a potentially responsible party, or develop a reasonable estimate of the potential incremental costs. It is reasonably possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on
Generation s and Exelon s future results of operations and cash flows. Finally, one of the other PRP s, the landfill owner and operator of the adjacent landfill, has indicated that it will be making a contribution claim against Cotter
for costs that it has incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those areas of the West Lake Landfill where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. At this time, Generation and Exelon do not possess sufficient
information to assess this claim and are therefore unable to determine the impact on their future results of operations and cash flows.    On
February 2, 2016, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to transfer remediation authority over the West Lake Landfill from the EPA to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). Such legislation
would become final upon passage in the U.S. House of Representatives and the signature of the President, and be subject to annual funding appropriations in the U.S. Budget. The legislation has not passed in the House. Remediation under FUSRAP would
not alter the liability of the PRPs, but could delay the determination of a final remedy and its implementation.    On August 8, 2011, Cotter was
notified by the DOJ that Cotter is considered a PRP with respect to the government s  clean-up  costs for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a former storage and reprocessing
facility named Latty Avenue near St. Louis, Missouri. The Latty Avenue site is included in ComEd s indemnification responsibilities discussed above as part of the sale of Cotter. The radioactive residues had been generated initially in
connection with the processing of uranium ores as part of the U.S. government s Manhattan Project. Cotter purchased the residues in 1969 for initial processing at the Latty Avenue facility for the subsequent extraction of uranium and metals. In
1976, the NRC found that the Latty Avenue site had radiation levels exceeding NRC criteria for decontamination of land areas. Latty Avenue was investigated and remediated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to funding under the
FUSRAP. The DOJ has not yet formally advised the PRPs of the amount that it is seeking, but it is believed to be approximately $90 million. The DOJ and the PRPs agreed to toll the statute of limitations until August 2017 so that settlement
discussions could proceed. Based on Generation s preliminary review, it appears probable that Generation has liability to Cotter under the indemnification agreement and has established an appropriate accrual for this liability, which is
included in the table above.    Commencing in February 2012, a number of lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District
of Missouri. Among the defendants were Exelon, Generation and ComEd, all of  
      536

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
which were subsequently dismissed from the case, as well as Cotter, which remains a defendant. The suits allege that individuals living in the North St. Louis area developed some form of cancer
or other serious illness due to Cotter s negligent or reckless conduct in processing, transporting, storing, handling and/or disposing of radioactive materials. Plaintiffs are asserting public liability claims under the Price-Anderson Act.
Their state law claims for negligence, strict liability, emotional distress, and medical monitoring have been dismissed. The complaints do not contain specific damage claims. In the event of a finding of liability against Cotter, it is reasonably
possible that Exelon would be financially responsible due to its indemnification responsibilities of Cotter described above. The court has dismissed a number of lawsuits, and is expected to dismiss additional lawsuits based on a recent ruling.  Pre-trial  motions and discovery are proceeding in the remaining cases and a  pre-trial  scheduling order has been filed with the court. At this stage of the litigation,
Generation and ComEd cannot estimate a range of loss, if any.      68th Street Dump.   In 1999, the U.S. EPA proposed to add the 68th Street
Dump in Baltimore, Maryland to the Superfund National Priorities List, and notified BGE and 19 others that they are PRPs at the site. In connection with BGE s 2000 corporate restructuring the responsibility for this liability was transferred to
Constellation and as a result of the 2012 Exelon and CEG merger is now Generation s responsibility. In March 2004, the PRPs formed the 68th Street Coalition and entered into consent order negotiations with the U.S. EPA to investigate  clean-up  options for the site under the Superfund Alternative Sites Program. In May 2006, a settlement among the U.S. EPA and the PRPs with respect to investigation of the site became effective. The settlement
requires the PRPs, over the course of several years, to identify contamination at the site and recommend  clean-up  options. The PRPs submitted their investigation of the range of
 clean-up  options in the first quarter of 2011. Although the investigation and options provided to the U.S. EPA are still subject to U.S. EPA review and selection of a remedy, the range of estimated  clean-up  costs to be allocated among all of the PRPs is in the range of $50 million to $64 million. On September 30, 2013, U.S. EPA issued the Record of Decision identifying its preferred remedial
alternative for the site. The estimated cost for the alternative chosen by U.S. EPA is consistent with the PRPs  estimated range of costs noted above. Based on Generation s preliminary review, it appears probable that Generation has
liability and has established an appropriate accrual for its share of the estimated  clean-up  costs.  
   Rossville Ash Site.   The Rossville Ash Site is a  32-acre  property located in Rosedale, Baltimore
County, Maryland, which was used for the placement of fly ash from 1983-2007. The property is owned by Constellation Power Source Generation, LLC (CPSG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Generation. In 2008, CPSG investigated and remediated the property
by entering it into the Maryland Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) to address any historic environmental concerns and ready the site for appropriate future redevelopment. The site was accepted into the program in 2010 and is currently going through
the process to remediate the site and receive closure from MDE. Exelon currently estimates the cost to close the site to be approximately $4 million, which has been fully reserved as of December 31, 2016 and is included in the table above.
     Sauer Dump.   On May 30, 2012, BGE was notified by the U.S. EPA that it is considered a PRP at the Sauer Dump Superfund site in
Dundalk, Maryland. The U.S. EPA offered BGE and three other PRPs the opportunity to conduct an environmental investigation and present cleanup recommendations at the site. In addition, the U.S. EPA is seeking recovery from the PRPs of
$1.7 million for past cleanup and investigation costs at the site. On March 11, 2013, BGE and three other PRPs signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the U.S. EPA which requires the PRPs to conduct a
remedial investigation and feasibility study at the site to determine what, if any, are the appropriate and recommended cleanup activities for the site. The ultimate outcome of this proceeding is uncertain. Since the U.S. EPA has not selected a
cleanup

remedy and the allocation of the cleanup costs among the PRPs has not been determined, an estimate of the range of BGE s reasonably possible loss, if any, cannot be determined. It is
possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon s and BGE s future results of operations and cash flows.  
   Riverside   .      In 2013, the MDE, at the request of EPA, conducted a site inspection and limited environmental sampling of
certain portions of the 170 acre Riverside property owned by BGE. The site consists of several different parcels with different current and historical uses. The sampling included soil and groundwater samples for a number of potential environmental
contaminants. The sampling confirmed the existence of contaminants consistent with the known historical uses of the various portions of the site. In March 2014, the MDE requested that BGE conduct an investigation which included a site-wide
investigation of soils, sediment, groundwater, and surface water to complement the MDE sampling. The field investigation was completed in January 2015, and a final report was provided to MDE on June 2, 2015. On November 3, 2015, MDE
provided BGE with its comments and recommendations on the report which require BGE to conduct further investigation and sampling at the site to better delineate the nature and extent of historic contamination, including  off-site  sediment and soil sampling. MDE did not request any interim remediation at this time and BGE anticipates completing the additional work requested by the end of the first quarter of 2017. BGE has established
what it believes is an appropriate reserve based upon the investigation to date. The established reserve is included in the table above. As the investigation and potential remediation proceed, it is possible that resolution of this matter could have
a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon s and BGE s future results of operations and cash flows.      Benning Road Site.   In
September 2010, PHI received a letter from EPA identifying the Benning Road site as one of six land-based sites potentially contributing to contamination of the lower Anacostia River. A portion of the site was formerly the location of a Pepco Energy
Services electric generating facility. That generating facility was deactivated in June 2012 and plant structure demolition was completed in July 2015. The remaining portion of the site consists of a Pepco transmission and distribution service
center that remains in operation. In December 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a consent decree entered into by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services with the DOEE, which requires Pepco and Pepco Energy Services to
conduct a RI/FS for the Benning Road site and an approximately 10 to 15 acre portion of the adjacent Anacostia River. The RI/FS will form the basis for the remedial actions for the Benning Road site and for the Anacostia River sediment associated
with the site. The consent decree does not obligate Pepco or Pepco Energy Services to pay for or perform any remediation work, but it is anticipated that DOEE will look to Pepco and Pepco Energy Services to assume responsibility for cleanup of any
conditions in the river that are determined to be attributable to past activities at the Benning Road site.    The initial RI field work began in
January 2013 and was completed in December 2014. In April 2015, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services submitted a draft RI Report to DOEE. After review, DOEE determined that additional field investigation and data analysis was required to complete the RI
process (much of which was beyond the scope of the original DOEE-approved RI work plan). In the meantime, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services revised the draft RI Report to address DOEE s comments and DOEE released the draft RI Report for public
review in February 2016. Once the additional RI work has been completed, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services will issue a draft  final  RI report for review and comment by DOEE and the public. Pepco and Pepco Energy Services will then proceed
to develop an FS to evaluate possible remedial alternatives for submission to DOEE.    Upon DOEE s approval of the final remedial investigation
and feasibility study Reports, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services will have satisfied their obligations under the consent decree. At that point,

DOEE will prepare a Proposed Plan regarding further response actions. After considering public comment on the Proposed Plan, DOEE will issue a Record of Decision identifying any further response
actions determined to be necessary.    PHI, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services have determined that a loss associated with this matter for PHI, Pepco and
Pepco Energy Services is probable and an estimated liability for this issue has been accrued, which is included in the table above. As the remedial investigation proceeds and potential remedies are identified, it is possible that additional reserves
could be established in amounts that could be material to PHI, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services. Pursuant to Exelon s March 2016 acquisition of PHI, Pepco Energy Services was transferred to Generation. The ultimate resolution of this matter is
currently not expected to have any significant financial impact on Generation.      Anacostia River Tidal Reach   .  Contemporaneous
with the Benning RI/FS being performed by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services, DOEE and certain federal agencies have been conducting a separate RI/FS focused on the entire tidal reach of the Anacostia River extending from just north of the  Maryland-D.C.  boundary line to the confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. In March 2016, DOEE released a draft of the river-wide RI Report for public review and comment. The river-wide RI incorporated the
results of the river sampling performed by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services as part of the Benning RI/FS, as well as similar sampling efforts conducted by owners of other sites adjacent to this segment of the river and supplemental river sampling
conducted by DOEE s contractor. DOEE asked Pepco, along with parties responsible for other sites along the river, to participate in a  Consultative Working Group  to provide input into the process for future remedial actions
addressing the entire tidal reach of the river and to ensure proper coordination with the other river cleanup efforts currently underway, including cleanup of the river segment adjacent to the Benning Road site resulting from the Benning Road RI/FS.
Pepco responded that it will participate in the Consultative Working Group but its participation is not an acceptance of any financial responsibility beyond the work that will be performed at the Benning Road site described above. DOEE has advised
the Consultative Working Group that the federal and DOEE authorities are conducting phase 2 of a remedial investigation. DOEE has targeted June 2018 as the date for remedy selection for  clean-up  of sediments
in this section of the river. The Consultative Working Group and the other possible PRPs have provided input into the proposed  clean-up  process and schedule. At this time, it is not possible to predict the
extent of Pepco s participation in the river-wide RI/FS process, and Pepco cannot estimate the reasonably possible range of loss for response costs beyond those associated with the Benning RI/FS component of the river-wide initiative. It is
possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon s and Pepco s future results of operations and cash flows.  
   Conectiv Energy Wholesale Power Generation Sites.   In July 2010, PHI sold the wholesale power generation business of Conectiv Energy
Holdings, Inc. and substantially all of its subsidiaries (Conectiv Energy) to Calpine Corporation (Calpine). Under New Jersey s Industrial Site Recovery Act (ISRA), the transfer of ownership triggered an obligation on the part of Conectiv
Energy to remediate any environmental contamination at each of the nine Conectiv Energy generating facility sites located in New Jersey. Under the terms of the sale, Calpine has assumed responsibility for performing the ISRA-required remediation and
for the payment of all related ISRA compliance costs up to $10 million. PHI is obligated to indemnify Calpine for any ISRA compliance remediation costs in excess of $10 million. According to PHI s estimates, the costs of ISRA-required
remediation activities at the nine generating facility sites located in New Jersey are in the range of approximately $7 million to $18 million, and PHI has established an appropriate accrual for its share of the estimated  clean-up  costs, which is included in the table above. Pursuant to Exelon s March 2016 acquisition of PHI, Conectiv Energy was transferred to Generation, however, the responsibility to indemnify Calpine remained
at PHI. The ultimate resolution of this matter is currently not expected to have any significant financial impact on PHI.

    Rock Creek Mineral Oil Release.   In late August 2015, a Pepco underground transmission
line in the District of Columbia suffered a breach, resulting in the release of  non-toxic  mineral oil surrounding the transmission line into the surrounding soil, and a small amount reached Rock Creek through
a storm drain. Pepco notified regulatory authorities, and Pepco and its spill response contractors placed booms in Rock Creek, blocked the storm drain to prevent the release of mineral oil into the creek and commenced remediation of soil around the
transmission line and the Rock Creek shoreline. Pepco estimates that approximately 6,100 gallons of mineral oil were released and that its remediation efforts recovered approximately 80% of the amount released. Pepco s remediation efforts are
ongoing under the direction of the DOEE, including the requirements of a February 29, 2016 compliance order which requires Pepco to prepare a full incident investigation report and prepare a removal action work plan to remove all impacted soils
in the vicinity of the storm drain outfall, and in collaboration with the National Park Service, the Smithsonian Institution/National Zoo and EPA. Pepco s investigation presently indicates that the damage to Pepco s facilities occurred
prior to the release of mineral oil when third-party excavators struck the Pepco underground transmission line while installing cable for another utility.  
 To the extent recovery is available against any party who contributed to this loss, PHI and Pepco will pursue such action. Exelon, PHI and Pepco
continue to investigate the cause of the incident, the parties involved, and legal responsibility under District of Columbia law, but do not believe that the remediation costs to resolve this matter will have a material adverse effect on their
respective financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.      Brandywine Fly Ash Disposal Site.   In February 2013, Pepco
received a letter from the MDE requesting that Pepco investigate the extent of waste on a Pepco   right-of-way   that traverses the Brandywine fly ash disposal site in
Brandywine, Prince George s County, Maryland, owned by NRG Energy, Inc. (as successor to GenOn MD Ash Management, LLC) (NRG). In July 2013, while reserving its rights and related defenses under a 2000 agreement covering the sale of this site,
Pepco indicated its willingness to investigate the extent of, and propose an appropriate closure plan to address, ash on the   right-of-way.   Pepco submitted a schedule for
development of a closure plan to MDE on September 30, 2013 and, by letter dated October 18, 2013, MDE approved the schedule.    Exelon, PHI
and Pepco have determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable and have estimated that the costs for implementation of a closure plan and cap on the site are in the range of approximately $3 million to $6 million, for which
an appropriate reserve has been established and is included in the table above. Exelon, PHI and Pepco believe that the costs incurred in this matter will be recoverable from NRG under the 2000 sale agreement.  
  Litigation and Regulatory Matters       Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE).        Exelon and Generation.   Generation maintains a reserve for claims
associated with asbestos-related personal injury actions in certain facilities that are currently owned by Generation or were previously owned by ComEd and PECO. The reserve is recorded on an undiscounted basis and excludes the estimated legal costs
associated with handling these matters, which could be material.    At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Generation had reserved approximately
$83 million and $95 million, respectively, in total for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $22 million of this amount related to 230 open claims presented to Generation, while the
 
      540

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       
  
remaining $61 million of the reserve is for estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims anticipated to arise through 2050, based on actuarial assumptions and analyses, which are
updated on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, Generation monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments and evaluates whether an adjustment to the reserve is necessary.  
 On November 22, 2013, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the Pennsylvania Workers Compensation Act does not apply to an employee s
disability or death resulting from occupational disease, such as diseases related to asbestos exposure, which manifests more than 300 weeks after the employee s last employment-based exposure, and that therefore the exclusivity provision of the
Act does not preclude such employee from suing his or her employer in court. The Supreme Court s ruling reverses previous rulings by the Pennsylvania Superior Court precluding current and former employees from suing their employers in
court, despite the fact that the same employee was not eligible for workers compensation benefits for diseases that manifest more than 300 weeks after the employee s last employment-based exposure to asbestos. Since the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court s ruling in November 2013, Exelon, Generation, and PECO have experienced an increase in asbestos-related personal injury claims brought by former PECO employees, all of which have been reserved against on a claim by claim
basis. Those additional claims are taken into account in projecting estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims.    On
November 4, 2015, the Illinois Supreme Court found that the provisions of the Illinois  Workers  Compensation Act and the Workers  Occupational Diseases Act barred an employee from bringing a direct civil action against an
employer for latent diseases, including asbestos-related diseases that fall outside the  25-year  limit of the statute of repose. The Illinois Supreme Court s ruling reversed previous rulings by the
Illinois Court of Appeals, which initially ruled that the Illinois Worker s Compensation law should not apply in cases where the diagnosis of an asbestos related disease occurred after the  25-year  maximum
time period for filing a Worker s Compensation claim. As a result of this ruling, Exelon, Generation, and ComEd have not recorded an increase to the asbestos-related bodily injury liability as of December 31, 2016.  
 There is a reasonable possibility that Exelon may have additional exposure to estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims in excess of the
amount accrued and the increases could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s, Generation s and PECO s future results of operations and cash flows.  
   BGE.   Since 1993, BGE and certain Constellation (now Generation) subsidiaries have been involved in several actions concerning asbestos.
The actions are based upon the theory of  premises liability,  alleging that BGE and Generation knew of and exposed individuals to an asbestos hazard. In addition to BGE and Generation, numerous other parties are defendants in these cases.
   To date, most asbestos claims which have been resolved relating to BGE and certain Constellation subsidiaries have been dismissed or resolved
without any payment and a small minority of these cases has been resolved for amounts that were not material to BGE or Generation s financial results. Presently, there are an immaterial number of asbestos cases pending against BGE and certain
Constellation subsidiaries.      Continuous Power Interruption (Exelon and ComEd)    
  Section 16-125  of the Illinois Public Utilities Act provides that in the event an electric utility, such as
ComEd, experiences a continuous power interruption of four hours or more that affects (in ComEd s  
      541

case) more than 30,000 customers, the utility may be liable for actual damages suffered by customers as a result of the interruption and may be responsible for reimbursement of local governmental
emergency and contingency expenses incurred in connection with the interruption. Recovery of consequential damages is barred. The affected utility may seek from the ICC a waiver of these liabilities when the utility can show that the cause of the
interruption was unpreventable damage due to weather events or conditions, customer tampering, or certain other causes enumerated in the law. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, ComEd did not have any material liabilities recorded for these storm
events.      Fund Transfer Restrictions (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PEPCO, DPL and ACE)    
 Under applicable law, Exelon may borrow or receive an extension of credit from its subsidiaries. Under the terms of Exelon s intercompany money pool
agreement, Exelon can lend to, but not borrow from the money pool.    The Federal Power Act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of
any public utility  to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  What constitutes  funds properly included in capital account  is undefined
in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as: (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed; (2) the dividend is not
excessive; and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. While these restrictions may limit the absolute amount of dividends that a particular subsidiary may pay, Exelon does not believe these limitations are materially
limiting because, under these limitations, the subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends sufficient to meet Exelon s actual cash needs.    Under
Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock unless, among other things,  [its] earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay same after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves,  or unless it has
specific authorization from the ICC. ComEd has also agreed in connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to
extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an
event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued.    PECO s Articles of Incorporation prohibit
payment of any dividend on, or other distribution to the holders of, common stock if, after giving effect thereto, the capital of PECO represented by its common stock together with its retained earnings is, in the aggregate, less than the
involuntary liquidating value of its then outstanding preferred securities. On May 1, 2013, PECO redeemed all outstanding preferred securities. As a result, the above ratio calculation is no longer applicable. Additionally, PECO may not declare
dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures, which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its
guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are
issued.    BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the MDPSC. First, BGE was prohibited from paying a dividend on its
common shares through the end of 2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity  
      542

ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating
agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must notify the MDPSC that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid. There are no other limitations on BGE paying common stock dividends
unless BGE elects to defer interest payments on the 6.20% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid.  
 PEPCO is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in Maryland and the District of Columbia. PEPCO is prohibited
from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, PEPCO s equity ratio would be 48% as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the commissions and the Board or (b) Pepco s
senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade.    DPL is subject to certain dividend
restrictions established by settlements approved in Delaware and Maryland. DPL is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, DPL s equity ratio would be 48% as equity levels are
calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the commissions and the Board or (b) DPL s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade.  
 ACE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in New Jersey. ACE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its
common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, ACE s equity ratio would be 48% as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the commissions and the Board or (b) ACE s senior unsecured credit rating is
rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade.      Baltimore City Franchise Taxes (BGE)    
 The City of Baltimore claims that BGE has maintained electric facilities in the City s public   right-of-ways   for over one hundred years without the proper franchise rights from the City. BGE has reviewed the City s claim and believes that it lacks merit. BGE has not recorded an accrual
for payment of franchise fees for past periods as a range of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Franchise fees assessed in future periods may be material to BGE s results of operations and cash flows.  
   Conduit Lease with City of Baltimore (Exelon and BGE)    
 On September 23, 2015, the Baltimore City Board of Estimates approved an increase in annual rental fees for access to the Baltimore City underground
conduit system effective November 1, 2015, from $12 million to $42 million, subject to an annual increase thereafter based on the Consumer Price Index. BGE subsequently entered into litigation with the City regarding the amount of and
basis for establishing the conduit fee. On November 30, 2016, the Baltimore City Board of Estimates approved a settlement agreement entered into between BGE and the City to resolve the disputes and pending litigation related to BGE s use
of and payment for the underground conduit system. As a result of the settlement, the parties have entered into a  six-year  lease that reduces the annual expense to $25 million in the first three years and
caps the annual expense in the last three years to not more than $29 million. BGE recorded a credit to Operating and maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of approximately $28 million for the reversal of the previously higher fees
accrued in the current year as well as the settlement of prior year disputed fee  true-up  amounts.

    Deere Wind Energy Assets (Exelon and Generation)    
 In 2013, Deere   Company ( Deere ) filed a lawsuit against Generation in the Delaware Superior Court relating to Generation s
acquisition of the Deere wind energy assets. Under the purchase agreement, Deere was entitled to receive  earn-out  payments if certain specific wind projects already under development in Michigan met
certain development and construction milestones following the sale. In the complaint, Deere seeks to recover a $14 million  earn-out  payment associated with one such project, which was never
completed. Generation has filed counterclaims against Deere for breach of contract, with a right of recoupment and set off. On June 2, 2016, the Delaware Superior Court entered summary judgment in favor of Deere. On January 17, 2017,
Generation filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Delaware. Generation has accrued an amount to cover its potential liability.      General
(All Registrants)      The Registrants are involved in various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary
course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. The Registrants maintain accruals
for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate,
(2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible
eventual loss.      Income Taxes (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)

     26. Segment Information (All Registrants)   
 Operating segments for each of the Registrants are determined based on information used by the chief operating decision maker(s) (CODM) in deciding how
to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.    In the first quarter of 2016, following the consummation of the PHI
Merger, three new reportable segments were added: Pepco, DPL and ACE. As a result, Exelon has twelve reportable segments, which include ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI s three reportable segments consisting of Pepco, DPL, and ACE, and Generation s
six reportable segments consisting of the  Mid-Atlantic,  Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and all other power regions referred to collectively as  Other Power Regions , which includes activities
in the South, West and Canada. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE each represent a single reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE s CODMs
evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE based on net income and return on equity.    Effective with
the consummation of the PHI Merger, PHI s reportable segments have changed based on the information used by the CODM to evaluate performance and allocate resources. PHI s reportable segments consist of Pepco, DPL and ACE. PHI s
Predecessor periods  segment information has been recast to conform to the current presentation. The reclassification of the segment information did not impact PHI s reported consolidated revenues or net income. PHI s CODM evaluates
the performance of and allocates resources to Pepco, DPL and ACE based on net income and return on equity.    The basis for Generation s
reportable segments is the integrated management of its electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to
provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). Generation s hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of Generation s six reportable
segments are as follows:      

Mid-Atlantic   represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia and parts of
Pennsylvania and North Carolina.        

Midwest  represents operations in the western half of PJM, which includes portions of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding
MISO s Southern Region, which covers all or most of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the remaining parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio not covered by PJM, and parts of Montana, Missouri and Kentucky.

New England  represents the operations within  ISO-NE  covering the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.    

New York  represents operations within  ISO-NY,  which covers the state of New York in its entirety.    

ERCOT  represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas, covering most of the state of Texas.    
      555

  (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)       

Other Power Regions :        

South  represents operations in the FRCC, MISO s Southern Region, and the remaining portions of the SERC not included within MISO or PJM, which includes all or most of Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and parts of Missouri, Kentucky and Texas. Generation s South region also includes operations in the SPP, covering Kansas, Oklahoma, most of Nebraska and parts of New
Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.        

West  represents operations in the WECC, which includes California ISO, and covers the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Colorado and parts of New Mexico, Wyoming and South
Dakota.        

Canada  represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO and the Canadian portion of MISO.    
 The CODMs for Exelon and Generation evaluate the performance of Generation s electric business activities and allocate resources based on revenues
net of purchased power and fuel expense (RNF). Generation believes that RNF is a useful measurement of operational performance. RNF is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed
more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Generation s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to the Utility Registrants. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with
the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for Generation s owned generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements. The results of
Generation s other business activities are not regularly reviewed by the CODM and are therefore not classified as operating segments or included in the regional reportable segment amounts. These activities include natural gas, as well as other
miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to Generation s overall operating revenues or results of operations. Further, Generation s unrealized
  mark-to-market   gains and losses on economic hedging activities and its amortization of certain intangible assets and liabilities relating to commodity contracts recorded
at fair value from mergers and acquisitions are also excluded from the regional reportable segment amounts. Exelon and Generation do not use a measure of total assets in making decisions regarding allocating resources to or assessing the performance
of these reportable segments.

region, and sales to ComEd of $176 million in the Midwest region, net of $7 million related to the unrealized   mark-to-market   losses related to the ComEd swap,
which eliminate upon consolidation.    

(b) 
 Other primarily includes Exelon s corporate operations, shared service entities and other financing and investment activities.    

(d) 
 Intersegment revenues exclude sales to unconsolidated affiliates. The intersegment profit associated with Generation s sale of certain products and services by and between Exelon s segments is not eliminated
in consolidation due to the recognition of intersegment profit in accordance with regulatory accounting guidance. For Exelon, these amounts are included in operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

ITEM 9.  
  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE        All Registrants   
 None.      

ITEM 9A.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        All Registrants Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 During the fourth quarter of 2016, each registrant s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of that registrant s disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of information in that registrant s periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These
disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by each registrant to ensure that (a) information relating to that registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be included in filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, is accumulated and made known to that registrant s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees of that registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Due to the inherent
limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.    Accordingly, as of December 31,
2016, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each registrant concluded that such registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives.  
  All Registrants Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 Each registrant continually strives to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to maintain
dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, any of the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.    Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of
internal control over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management is excluding an assessment of such internal controls of ConEdison Solutions,
which was acquired on September 1, 2016, from its evaluation of the effectiveness of Exelon s and Generation s disclosure controls and procedures. The total assets related to ConEdison Solutions are approximately less than 1% and
total operating revenues related to ConEdison Solutions are 1% and 2%, respectively, of Exelon s and Generation s related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.  
  All Registrants Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 Management is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. As a
result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2016 and, therefore, concluded that each registrant s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

   Exelon Corporation and Subsidiary Companies   
  Schedule I   Condensed Financial Information of Parent (Exelon Corporate)   
  Notes to Financial Statements      1. Basis of Presentation
    Exelon Corporate is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries. These condensed
financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance with Rule  12-04,  Schedule I of Regulation  S-X.  These statements should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Exelon Corporation.    Exelon Corporate owns 100% of all of its significant
subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd), of which Exelon Corporate owns more than 99%, and BGE, of which Exelon owns 100% of the common stock but none of BGE s preferred stock. BGE redeemed
all of its outstanding preferred stock in 2016.     2. Mergers   
 On March 23, 2016, Exelon completed the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement among Exelon, Purple Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Exelon (Merger Sub) and Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI). As a result of that merger, Merger Sub was merged into PHI (the PHI Merger) with PHI surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon and Exelon Energy Delivery Company, LLC (EEDC), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon which also owns Exelon s interests in ComEd, PECO and BGE (through a special purpose subsidiary in the case of BGE). See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on the PHI Merger.     3. Debt and Credit Agreements   
   Short-Term Borrowings      Exelon Corporate meets its
short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Exelon Corporate had no commercial paper borrowings at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
   Credit Agreements      On May 30, 2014, Exelon
Corporate amended and extended its unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of $600 million through May 2019. As of December 31, 2016, Exelon Corporation had available capacity under those commitments
of $571 million. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding Exelon Corporation s credit agreement.

(ii) the Executive s 201_ target annual incentive award of $              . Payment shall commence not later than forty-five days following the Termination Date, in
substantially equal regular payroll installments over a period of fifteen months; and    (b) Executive shall remain eligible to receive a
pro-rated annual incentive award for 201_ based on actual performance results determined in a manner consistent with peer executives, payable at the time such awards (if any) are paid to active executives (but not later than March 15, 201_),
and such payment shall be considered a short-term deferral for purposes of section 409A of the Code.    4.  Tax Withholding . The

 7.  Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits . The Executive shall be eligible for a retirement benefit under the Exelon applicable

Executive s timely execution of the Waiver and Release, be credited with             months additional service calculated as though he or she received the severance benefits specified
in Section 3(a) as regular salary incentive pay over such period (and limited in its application to the amounts of such payments that exceed the compensation limitations applicable to qualified pension plans under the Code). Such benefit shall
be paid as provided in Section 8(b).  
      2  

8.  Employee and Other Benefits .  
 (a) During the period commencing on the Termination Date and ending
               months after the Termination Date (the   Severance Period  ) and in satisfaction of COBRA continuation coverage during such period with respect to
healthcare benefits, (i) the Executive (and his or her participating dependents) shall be eligible to participate in, and shall receive benefits under Exelon s welfare benefit plans (including medical, dental, vision and hearing) in which
the Executive (and his or her eligible dependents) were participating immediately prior to the Termination Date, and (ii) the Executive shall be eligible to participate in the life insurance programs in which he or she was a participant
immediately prior to the Termination Date, in each case on the same basis as if the Executive had remained actively employed during the Severance Period.  
 (b) Following the Severance Period, the Executive (and his or her eligible dependents) shall be eligible for continued health care coverage at
Executive s sole expense for any remaining period required by COBRA.    (c) The Company shall pay to the Executive, in the time and
manner specified in the terms and conditions of such plans and any distribution elections by the Executive in effect thereunder, his or her account balances (if any) under Exelon s deferred compensation plans, as adjusted by all applicable
earnings and losses on such account balances.    (d) The Executive shall be entitled to purchase the computer furnished by the Company for
his or her use, subject to removal of data and programs as determined by the Company. The Executive shall be responsible for payment of expenses incurred after the Termination Date with respect to the Company-owned cellular phone furnished for his
or her use.    (e) If the Executive is entitled to any benefit under any employee benefit plan of the Company that is accrued and vested on
the Termination Date and that is not expressly referred to in this Agreement, such benefit shall be provided to the Executive in accordance with the terms of such employee benefit plan.  
 (f) Notwithstanding Section 8(e) or anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that
he or she is not and shall not be entitled to benefits under any other severance or change in control plan, program, agreement or arrangement, and that the benefits provided under this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive benefits to which the
Executive may become entitled upon his or her termination of employment. In the event the Executive dies prior to executing the Waiver and Release (as described in Section 9 below) attached hereto, neither he or she, his or her estate, nor any
other person shall be entitled to any further compensation or benefits under this Agreement, unless and until the executor of the Executive s estate (and/or such other heirs or representatives as may be requested by the Company) executes upon
Company request and does not revoke such a Waiver and Release.  
      3  

9.  Waiver and Release . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Executive s
right to the payments and benefits under this Agreement shall be contingent upon (a) Executive having executed and delivered to the Company a waiver and general release provided by the Company (the   Waiver and Release  ) not
earlier than the Termination Date and not later than the date set forth in the release (but in no event more than                days after the Termination Date) (the
 Consideration Period ), (b) Executive not revoking such release in accordance with the terms of the release and (c) Executive not violating any of Executive s on-going obligations under this Agreement; provided, however,
that the Company has the discretion to pay such benefits prior to receipt of the Waiver and Release and/or the expiration of the revocation period; provided further that if Executive does not execute and deliver the Waiver and Release to the Company
prior to the expiration of the Consideration Period or if the Executive revokes the Waiver and Release in accordance with its terms, Executive shall pay to the Company within 10 days following the expiration of the Consideration Period or the date
such release was revoked, a lump sum payment of all payments received by Executive to date hereunder.    10.  Restrictive Covenants .
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he or she is bound by, and subject to, the Restrictive Covenants and the Waiver and Release. The Executive shall comply with, and observe, the Restrictive Covenants including, without limitation, the
confidential information, non-solicitation and intellectual property provisions and related covenants contained therein, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In the event the Company determines that Executive has breached any of the
Restrictive Covenants or the Waiver and Release or has engaged in conduct during his or her employment with the Company that would constitute ground for termination for Cause, benefits under this Agreement shall terminate immediately, and Executive
shall reimburse Exelon for any benefits received.    11.  Certain Tax Matters .  
 (a) If it is determined by Exelon s independent auditors that any severance payment, benefit or enhancement that is provided to the
Executive pursuant to the terms of the this Agreement is or will become subject to any excise tax under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any similar tax payable under any United States federal, state, local, foreign
or other law (  Excise Taxes  ), then such payment, benefit or enhancement shall be reduced to the largest amount which would not cause any such Excise Tax to by payable by the Executive and not cause a loss of the related income tax
deduction by the Company.    (b) The parties intend this Agreement to comply with section 409A of the Code. In the event the timing of any
payment or benefit under this Agreement would result in any tax or penalty under section 409A of the Code, the Company may reasonably adjust the timing of such payment or benefit if doing so will eliminate or materially reduce such tax or penalty
and amend this Agreement accordingly. Executive acknowledges that Executive has been advised to consult Executive s personal tax advisor concerning this Agreement, and has not relied on the Company or Subsidiary for tax advice.  
 12.  Non-disparagement . The Executive shall not (a) make any written or oral statement that brings the Company or any of its
affiliates or the employees, officers, directors or agents of the Company or any of its affiliates into disrepute, or tarnishes any of their images or  
      4  

reputations or (b) publish, comment upon or disseminate any statements suggesting or accusing the Company or any of its affiliates, employees, officers, directors or agents of any misconduct
or unlawful behavior. The provisions of this Section 12 shall not apply to truthful testimony as a witness, compliance with other legal obligations, assertion of or defense against any claim of breach of this Agreement, or any activity that
otherwise may be required by the lawful order of a court or agency of competent jurisdiction, and shall not require the Executive to make false statements or disclosures.  
 13.  Publicity . Executive shall not issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the terms
or provisions of this Agreement, nor disclose the contents hereof to any third party (other than to members of his or her immediate family or to tax, financial and legal advisors), without obtaining the consent of Exelon, except where such release,
announcement or disclosure shall be required by applicable law or administrative regulation or agency or other legal process.    14.
 Other Employment; Other Plans . The Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any provision of this Agreement. The amounts payable
hereunder shall not be reduced by any payments received by the Executive from any other employer;  provided ,  however , that any continued welfare benefits provided for by Section 8(a) shall not duplicate any benefits that are
provided to the Executive and his or her family by such other employer and shall be secondary to any coverage provided by Medicare.    15.
 Cooperation by the Executive . During the Severance Period, the Executive shall (a) be reasonably available to the Company to respond to requests by them for information pertaining to or relating to matters which may be within the
knowledge of the Executive and (b) cooperate with the Company in connection with any existing or future litigation or other proceedings brought by or against the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, to the extent Exelon reasonably deems the
Executive s cooperation necessary, including truthful testimony in any related proceeding.    16.  Successors; Binding Agreement .
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and binding upon the Company and its successors, and by the Executive, his or her spouse, personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators and heirs. This Agreement, being personal, may not be
assigned by Executive.    17.  Governing Law; Validity . This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with
the terms of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan, and the applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and section 409A of the Code.  
 18.  Entire Agreement . This Agreement and the Waiver and Release constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and preempt any other understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have related in any manner to the subject matter hereof. Executive
acknowledges that the Company has made no representations regarding the tax consequences of payments under this Agreement and has had the opportunity to consult Executive s tax advisor.  
      5  

19.  Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed to be an original and both of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.    20.  Miscellaneous . No
provision of this Agreement may be modified or waived unless such modification or waiver is agreed to in writing and executed by the Executive and by a duly authorized officer of the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any
breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or
subsequent time. Failure by the Executive or the Company to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement or to assert any right which the Executive or the Company may have hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such
provision or right or any other provision or right of this Agreement.    21.  Beneficiary . If the Executive dies prior to receiving
all of the amounts payable hereunder (other than amounts payable under any plan referenced in Section 8(d), which shall be governed by any beneficiary designation in effect thereunder) but after executing the Waiver and Release, such amounts
shall be paid, except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein or in the applicable plans, to the beneficiary (  Beneficiary  ) designated with respect to this Agreement by the Executive in writing to the Vice President,
Corporate Compensation of the Company during his or her lifetime, which the Executive may change from time to time by new designation filed in like manner without the consent of any Beneficiary; or if no such Beneficiary is designated, to his or her
surviving spouse, and if there be none, to his or her estate.    22.  Nonalienation of Benefits . Benefits payable under this Agreement
shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, prior to actually being received by the Executive, and any such attempt to dispose of any right to benefits payable hereunder
shall be void.    23.  Severability . If all or any part of this Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be
unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any portion of this Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid, except that in the event a determination is made that the Restrictive Covenants as applied to
the Executive are invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then this Agreement shall be void and the Company shall have no obligation to provide benefits hereunder. Any paragraph or part of a paragraph so declared to be unlawful or invalid
shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such paragraph or part of a paragraph to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.  
 24.  Communications . Nothing in this Agreement or the Waiver and Release shall be construed to prohibit or limit the Executive from
filing a charge with, or reporting possible violations of law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the National Labor Relations Board, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, the
Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Securities Exchange  
      6  

Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law or regulation, or taking any other
action protected under section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act. The Executive does not need the prior authorization of the Company to make any such charges, reports or disclosures, and is not required to notify the Company that Executive has
made such charges reports or disclosures, and no such report or disclosure shall be considered a violation of Section 12 of this Agreement or the Waiver and Release. In addition, neither this Agreement nor the Waiver and Release limits the
Executive s ability to receive a monetary award from a government-administered whistleblower award program for providing any such reports or disclosures directly to a governmental agency. Executive acknowledges, however, that the Waiver and
Release requires Executive to specifically waive all rights to recover any monetary damages from the Company, including but not limited to lost wages and benefits, lost pay, damages for emotional distress, punitive damages, reinstatement, and
attorneys  fees and costs.    25.  Sections . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any reference to a
 Section  shall be to a Section of this Agreement.    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Exelon and Subsidiary have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their duly authorized officers and the Executive has executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

Certification Filed by Christopher M. Crane for Exelon Corporation 

Exhibit  31-1    
  CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE  13a-14(a)  AND  15d-14(a)  OF THE   
  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934   
 I, Christopher M. Crane, certify that:      

1. 
 I have reviewed this annual report on Form  10-K  of Exelon Corporation;        

2. 
 Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;        

3. 
 Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;        

4. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
 13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e))  and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f))  for the registrant and have:        

(a) 
 Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;        

(b) 
 Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;        

(c) 
 Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of
the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and        

(d) 
 Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter
in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and    

5. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the

 Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;        

4. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules

(a) 
 Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;        

(b) 
 Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;        

(c) 
 Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of

(d) 
 Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter
in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and    

5. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the
registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):        

(a) 
 All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information; and        

(b) 
 Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
