PART I 
   
  Item 1. Business 
    
  Overview 
    
  CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively  CVS Health,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ), is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health. At the forefront of a changing health care landscape, the Company has an unmatched suite of capabilities and the expertise needed to drive innovations that will help shape the future of health care. 
    
  We are currently the only integrated pharmacy health care company with the ability to impact consumers, payors, and providers with innovative, channel-agnostic solutions to complex challenges managing costs and care. We have a deep understanding of their diverse needs through our unique integrated model, and we are bringing them innovative solutions that help increase access to quality care, deliver better health outcomes and lower overall health care costs.  
    
  Through more than 9,700 retail locations, more than 1,100 walk-in health care clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with nearly 90 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year, expanding specialty pharmacy services and a leading stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, we enable people, businesses, and communities to manage health in more affordable, effective ways. We are delivering break-through products and services, from advising patients on their medications at our CVS Pharmacy        locations, to introducing unique programs to help control costs for our clients at CVS Caremark       , to innovating how care is delivered to our patients with complex conditions through CVS Specialty   TM   , to improving pharmacy care for the senior community through Omnicare       , or by expanding access to high-quality, low-cost care at CVS MinuteClinic       . 
    
  We have three reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  The Pharmacy Services Segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) solutions, as described more fully below, to our clients consisting primarily of employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part D plans, Managed Medicaid plans, plans offered on the public and private exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. In addition, through our SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. The Pharmacy Services Segment operates under the CVS Caremark        Pharmacy Services, Caremark       , CVS Caremark       , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , CVS Specialty   TM   , Accordant       , SilverScript       , NovoLogix       , Coram       , Navarro        Health Services and ACS Pharmacy names. As of   December 31, 2016  , the Pharmacy Services Segment operated   23   retail specialty pharmacy stores,   13   specialty mail order pharmacies and   four   mail order dispensing pharmacies, and   84   branches for infusion and enteral services, including approximately   73   ambulatory infusion suites and   three   centers of excellence, located in   41   states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. During the year ended   December 31, 2016  , our PBM filled or managed approximately   1.2 billion   prescriptions (which equates to 1.6 billion prescriptions when counting 90-day prescriptions as three prescriptions). 
    
  Pharmacy Services Business Strategy   - Our business strategy centers on providing innovative tools and strategies, as well as quality client service in order to help improve clinical outcomes for our clients  health benefit plan members while assisting our clients and their plan members in better managing overall health care costs. Our goal is to produce superior results for our clients and their plan members by leveraging our expertise in core PBM services, including: plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. 
    
  In addition, as a fully integrated pharmacy services company, we are able to offer our clients and their plan members a variety of programs and tools, including plan design offerings, that benefit from our integrated systems and the ability of our almost 36,000 pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants to interact personally with the many plan members. Through our multiple member touch points (retail stores, mail order, infusion, long-term care and specialty pharmacies, retail clinics, digital resources and cost management tools), we seek to engage plan members in behaviors that help lower cost and improve health care outcomes. Examples of these programs and services include: Maintenance Choice       , a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our CVS Pharmacy retail stores for the same price as mail order; Pharmacy Advisor       , a program that facilitates face-to-face and telephone counseling by our pharmacists to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to  
  
   3 

identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions; compliance and persistency programs designed to help ensure that patients take their medications in the proper manner; enhanced disease management programs that are targeted at managing chronic disease states; Specialty Connect       , our integrated specialty pharmacy offering which integrates specialty mail and retail capabilities, providing members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a CVS Pharmacy location or submit it through our specialty mail order pharmacies; and an ExtraCare        Health Card program which offers discounts to eligible plan members on certain over-the-counter health care products sold in our CVS Pharmacy stores. In addition, MinuteClinic        is an important and differentiated part of the enterprise that offers certain capabilities to PBM clients and their members. For example, we offer plan-sponsored co-pay reductions to encourage use of MinuteClinic, thereby helping to reduce emergency room visits and to lower overall health care costs. Other ways we are working with our clients include partnerships with health plan clients sponsoring patient centered medical homes, biometric screenings for plan members, closing gaps in care, and onsite clinics at client corporate headquarters. 
    
  PBM Services   - Our PBM solutions are described more fully below. 
    
  Plan Design Offerings and Administration   - Our clients sponsor pharmacy benefit plans that facilitate the ability of eligible members in these plans to receive prescribed medications. We assist our clients in designing pharmacy benefit plans that help minimize the costs to the client while helping improve health outcomes. We also administer these benefit plans selected by our clients and assist them in monitoring the effectiveness of these plans through frequent, informal communications, their use of our proprietary software, as well as through a formal annual client review. 
    
  We make recommendations to our clients helping them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lower cost, clinically appropriate drugs. We help our clients control costs by recommending plan designs that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available. Our clients also have the option, through plan design, to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products on their drug lists or  formularies . 
    
  Formulary Management   - We utilize an independent panel of doctors, pharmacists and other medical experts, referred to as our Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, to review and approve the selection of drugs that meet our high standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on one of our template formularies. Our formularies provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to help ensure member access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the client s pharmacy benefit plan, while helping to drive the lowest net cost for our clients that select one of our formularies. To help improve clinical outcomes for members and clients, we conduct ongoing, independent reviews of all drugs, including, but not limited to, those appearing on the formularies and generic equivalent products, as well as our clinical programs. Many of our clients choose to adopt one of our template formulary offerings as part of their plan design. 
    
  Medicare Part D Services   - We participate in the administration of the drug benefit added to the Medicare program under Part D of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ) through the provision of PBM services to those of our health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as a Medicare Part D prescription drug plans ( PDP ) or as a Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan ( MA-PD ) and by offering Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits through SilverScript, a PDP that has contracted with the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). We also assist employer, union and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy made available under the MMA by collecting and submitting eligibility and/or drug cost data to CMS in order for them to obtain the subsidy and offer Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits to such clients' retirees through SilverScript-sponsored Employer Group Waiver Plans ( EGWPs ). 
    
  Mail Order Pharmacy   - As of   December 31, 2016  , we operated   four   mail order dispensing pharmacies in the United States. Plan members or their prescribers submit prescriptions or refill requests, primarily for maintenance medications, to these pharmacies via mail, telephone, fax, e-prescribing or the Internet. We also offer Maintenance Choice       , a program in which eligible client plan members in most states can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our CVS Pharmacy retail stores for the same price as mail order, and operate a network of smaller mail order specialty pharmacies described below. Our staff pharmacists review mail order prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of our prescription management systems. This review may involve communications with the prescriber and, with the prescriber s approval when required, can result in generic substitution, therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to help reduce cost and/or improve quality of treatment. These pharmacies have been awarded Mail Order Pharmacy accreditation from Utilization Review Accreditation Commission ( URAC ), a Washington DC-based health care accrediting organization that establishes quality standards for the health care industry. 

4 

Specialty Pharmacy   - Our specialty pharmacies support individuals who require complex and expensive drug therapies. As of   December 31, 2016  , our specialty pharmacy operations included   13   specialty mail order pharmacies located throughout the United States that are used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases and disorders. These pharmacies have also been awarded Specialty Pharmacy accreditation from URAC. As of   December 31, 2016  , the Company operated a network of   23   retail specialty pharmacy stores, which operate under the CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM    and Navarro        Health Services names. These stores average 1,100 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications, homeopathic remedies and vitamins. Through our affiliate Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ), one of the nation s largest providers of comprehensive infusion services, we care for approximately 146,000 patients annually, providing specialty infusion and enteral nutrition services. Our Specialty Connect        product, which integrates our specialty pharmacy mail and retail capabilities, provides members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a CVS Pharmacy location. Whether submitted through our specialty mail order pharmacy or at a CVS Pharmacy, all prescriptions are filled through our specialty mail order pharmacies, so all revenue from this specialty prescription services program is recorded within the Pharmacy Services Segment. Members then can choose to pick up their medication at their local CVS Pharmacy, except in three states that do not allow retail pick-up, or have it sent to their home through the mail. Additionally, with the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ), we expanded our specialty pharmacy to include the specialty pharmacy operations of Omnicare which operates under the name ACS Pharmacy. 
    
  Retail Pharmacy Network     Management   - We maintain a national network of more than   68,000   retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately   41,000   chain pharmacies (which includes our CVS Pharmacy locations) and   27,000   independent pharmacies, in the United States, Puerto Rico, District of Columbia, Guam and the Virgin Islands. When a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the point-of-sale. This data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems, which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility, while also performing a drug utilization review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription. We are also able to build client-specific networks and narrow networks to further drive savings for our clients. 
    
  Prescription Management Systems   - We dispense prescription drugs both directly, through one of our mail order or specialty pharmacies, or through a network of retail pharmacies, described above. All prescriptions processed through our systems, whether they are filled through one of our mail order or specialty dispensing pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network, are analyzed, processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems. These systems provide essential features and functionality to allow a plan member to use their prescription drug benefit. These systems also streamline the process by which prescriptions are processed by staff and network pharmacists, by enhancing review of various items through automation, including, but not limited to, plan eligibility, early refills, duplicate dispensing, appropriateness of dosage, drug interactions or allergies, over-utilization and potential fraud.   
    
  Clinical Services   - We offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner. Our programs are primarily designed to promote good health outcomes, and to help target inappropriate utilization and non-adherence to medication, each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact member health and client pharmacy and medical spend. In this regard, we offer various utilization management, medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement the client s plan design and clinical strategies. 
    
  Disease Management Programs   - Our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers and other third parties. Our Accordant        programs include integrated rare disease management programs, which cover diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson s disease, seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis. The majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ( NCQA ), a private, not-for-profit organization that evaluates, accredits and certifies a wide range of health care organizations. They have also been awarded Case Management Accreditation from URAC. 
    
  Medical Pharmacy Management   - We offer a technology platform, NovoLogix       , an online preauthorization tool that helps identify and capture cost savings opportunities for specialty drugs billed under the medical benefit by identifying outliers to appropriate dosages and costs, and helps to ensure appropriate clinical use of these drugs. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Information Systems   - We currently operate and support a small number of claim adjudication platforms to support our Pharmacy Services Segment. However, the majority of our clients have migrated to one platform. These information systems incorporate architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail order prescriptions, adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and delivering other solutions to our PBM clients. Our Health Engagement Engine   TM      technology and proprietary clinical algorithms help enable our mail and specialty pharmacists provide quality care, and our  
  
   5 

enterprise digital strategy and integrated digital offerings help patients seamlessly manage mail, specialty and retail prescriptions. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Clients   - Our clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part D plans, Managed Medicaid plans and plans offered on public and private exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals located throughout the United States. We provide pharmaceuticals to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems, among other things, to help perform safety checks, drug interaction screening and identify opportunities for generic substitution. We generate substantially all of our Pharmacy Services Segment net revenue from dispensing and managing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients. In 2016, net revenues from Aetna accounted for approximately 11.2% of our consolidated net revenues. In 2015 and 2014, no single PBM client accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Seasonality   - The majority of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenues are not seasonal in nature. However, our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D standard benefit design results in coverage that varies with a member's cumulative annual out-of-pocket costs. The benefit design generally results in plan sponsors sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early part of the year. As a result, the PDP plan pay percentage or benefit ratio generally decreases and operating profit generally increases as the year progresses.  
    
  Pharmacy Services Competition   - We believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include: (i) the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers as well as to negotiate favorable discounts from, and access to, retail pharmacy networks; (ii) the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies including the development and utilization of preferred formularies; (iii) the ability to market PBM products and services; (vii) the commitment to provide flexible, clinically-oriented services to clients and be responsive to clients  needs; and the quality, scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members, as well as operational excellence in delivering services. The Pharmacy Services Segment has a significant number of competitors offering PBM services including large, national PBM companies, PBMs owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone PBMs (e.g., Express Scripts, OptumRx, Humana, Prime Therapeutics and MedImpact). 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  As of   December 31, 2016  , the Retail/LTC Segment included   9,709   retail locations (of which   7,980   were our stores that operated a pharmacy and   1,674   were our pharmacies located within Target Corporation ( Target ) stores), our online retail pharmacy websites, CVS.com       , Navarro.com   TM    and Onofre.com.br   TM   ,   38   onsite pharmacy stores, our long-term care pharmacy operations and our retail health care clinics. The retail locations are in   49   states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy       , CVS       , CVS Pharmacy y m s       , Longs Drugs       , Navarro Discount Pharmacy        and Drogaria Onofre   TM    names. With the addition of the pharmacies of Target, we currently operate in all of the top 100 United States drugstore markets. The CVS Pharmacy retail drugstores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of over-the-counter and personal care products, beauty and cosmetic products, and general merchandise, which we refer to as  front store  products. The pharmacies within Target stores sell prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs that are required to be held behind the counter. Existing retail stores range in size from approximately 5,000 to 30,000 square feet, although most new stores range in size from approximately 11,000 to 15,000 square feet and typically include a drive-thru pharmacy. The pharmacies within Target stores range in size from approximately 450 to 1,100 square feet. During 2016, our Retail/LTC Segment filled approximately   1.2 billion   prescriptions (counting 90-day prescriptions as three prescriptions), and we held approximately 23.8% of the United States retail pharmacy market.  
    
  Our acquisition of Omnicare broadened our base of pharmacy care to an additional dispensing channel, long-term care pharmacy. Omnicare s long-term care ( LTC ) operations include the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. Omnicare also provides commercialization services under the name RxCrossroads       . LTC is comprised of   152   spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders, of which   32   are also hub pharmacies that use automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC primarily operates under the Omnicare        and NeighborCare        names. With the addition of the LTC operations, we are continuing to enhance our service offerings to further address the needs of an aging population throughout the continuum of senior care. 
    
  Retail Pharmacy Business Strategy   - Our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes. In that regard, the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services, including flu vaccinations as well as face-to-face patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies, closing gaps in care and  
  
   6 

recommending more cost effective drug therapies. We also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service, innovation and convenience. One of the keys to our strategy is technology, which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services. We are leveraging digital to empower our customers and patients by making the full breadth of health care and pharmacy services available to them anytime, anywhere. We are introducing digital tools to make it easier for people to save time and money and to live healthier lives. In 2016, we rolled out CVS Pay   TM    nationwide, an end-to-end mobile payment solution that integrates payment, prescription pick-up and our ExtraCare        loyalty program into one spot at checkout. We believe that continuing to innovate with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers  needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction. 
    
  Retail/LTC Products and Services   - A typical retail store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and proprietary brand merchandise. Front store categories include over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, personal care products, convenience foods, photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise and greeting cards. The pharmacies within Target stores sell prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs that are required to be held behind the counter. The LTC operations include distribution of pharmaceuticals and related consulting and ancillary services. We purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not likely have a material effect on the business. Our clinics offer a variety of health care services by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. 
    
  Retail/LTC net revenues by major product group are as follows:

    Percentages are estimates based on store point-of-sale data for the stores and revenue system data for sales outside the stores. 
        
  Pharmacy   - Pharmacy revenues represented more than two-thirds of Retail Pharmacy revenues in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to industry demographics, e.g., an aging American population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness, the introduction of new pharmaceutical products, and Medicare Part D. We believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology, as well as our innovative partnerships with health plans, PBMs and providers. Given the nature of prescriptions, people want their prescriptions filled accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology, and ready when promised. Consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars. To assist our customers with these needs, we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier, easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs, improve health, and save lives. Examples include: our Patient Care Initiative, an enhanced medication adherence program; Maintenance Choice       , a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our retail pharmacy stores for the same price as mail order; Pharmacy Advisor       , our program that facilitates pharmacist counseling, both face-to-face and over the telephone, to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions; Specialty Connect       , our integrated specialty pharmacy offering which integrates specialty mail and retail capabilities, providing members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a CVS Pharmacy location or submit it through our specialty mail order pharmacies; as well as   ScriptSync       , a service that enables patients with multiple medications to pick up their eligible maintenance prescriptions in a single monthly CVS Pharmacy visit  . Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy Advisor, Specialty Connect and ScriptSync are all programs that demonstrate our ability to enhance the customer experience through our integrated enterprise products and services. Further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology, such as our Drug Utilization Review system that helps check for harmful interactions between prescription drugs and patient identified over-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal remedies; RxConnect, our proprietary pharmacy system that integrates our product delivery and clinical workflows as well as advanced patient safety functionality such as drug utilization review; our prescription refill program, ReadyFill       ; and our online retail businesses, CVS.com, Navarro.com and Onofre.com.br. In December 2015, we expanded our pharmacy offering with the  
  
   7 

acquisition of the pharmacies within Target stores. Now that the system integration is complete, we will offer all the same pharmacy services available in our retail drugstores and online at our pharmacies within Target stores. 
    
  Front Store   - Front store revenues benefited from our strategy to innovate with new and unique products and services, using innovative personalized marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers  needs and preferences. A key component of our front store strategy is our ExtraCare        card program, which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base. The ExtraCare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the United States. The ExtraCare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices, customized coupons, ExtraBucks        rewards and other benefits. We continue to launch and enhance new and exclusive brands to create unmatched offerings in beauty. Another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings, which include a full range of high-quality CVS Pharmacy        and proprietary brand products that are only available through CVS Pharmacy stores. We currently carry approximately 7,000 CVS Pharmacy and proprietary brand products, which accounted for approximately 22.6% of our front store revenues during 2016. These products include expanded offerings of healthy foods and vitamins. Furthermore, we are tailoring certain groups of stores, such as suburban area stores, to better meet the needs of our customers. This includes the launch of CVS Curbside in late 2016. Developed in partnership with industry leader Curbside, customers can use the CVS Pharmacy app to have front store purchases delivered to their car when they pull up to our store. 
    
  MinuteClinic -   As of   December 31, 2016  , we operated   1,139   MinuteClinic        locations in 33 states and the District of Columbia, of which   1,053   were located in our retail pharmacy stores,   79   were located in Target stores and seven were located in corporate campuses or other locations. We opened seven new clinics during 2016. Our clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally established guidelines to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions, provide wellness services and deliver vaccinations. Insurers value our clinics because they provide convenient, high-quality, cost-effective care, in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more expensive sites of care. As a result, visits paid for by employers, health insurers or other third parties accounted for approximately 91% of MinuteClinic s total revenues in 2016. MinuteClinic is collaborating with our Pharmacy Services Segment to help meet the needs of CVS Caremark s client plan members by offering programs that can improve member health and lower costs. MinuteClinic is now affiliated with more than 70 major health systems and continues to build a platform that supports primary care.  
    
  Long-term Care   - Through our Omnicare business, we provide the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. LTC s customers consist of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, independent living communities, hospitals, correctional facilities, and other health care service providers. We provide pharmacy consulting, including monthly patient drug therapy evaluations, assist in compliance with state and federal regulations and provide proprietary clinical and health management programs. We also provide pharmaceutical case management services for retirees, employees and dependents who have drug benefits under corporate-sponsored health care programs.  
    
  Onsite Pharmacies   - We also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites, typically under the CarePlus       , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM    or CVS Pharmacy        name, which provide certain health plan members and customers with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions. 
    
  Retail Pharmacy Drugstore Development   - The addition of new stores has played, and will continue to play, a key role in our continued growth and success. Our store development program focuses on three areas: entering new markets, adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient sites. During 2016, we opened 130 new and acquired retail stores, relocated 50 stores and closed 46 stores. During the last five years, we opened more than 1,100 new and relocated stores, and acquired 1,841 stores including the pharmacies acquired from Target. We believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in more accessible markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current health care environment. As a result, we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position given the changing health care landscape and to meet the increasing needs of our customers. 
    
  Retail/LTC Information Systems   - We have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver exceptional customer service, enhance safety and quality, and expand our patient care services while lowering operating costs. Leveraging our retail pharmacy fulfillment system, RxConnect and our proprietary WeCARE Workflow, supports our pharmacy teams by prioritizing work to meet customer expectations, facilitating prescriber outreach, and seamlessly integrating our clinical programs. This solution delivers improved efficiency and enhances the customer experience, as well as providing a framework to accommodate the evolution of pharmacy practice and the expansion of our clinical programs. Our Health Engagement Engine   TM    technology and proprietary clinical algorithms enable us to help identify opportunities for our pharmacists to deliver face-to-face counseling regarding patient health and safety matters, including adherence issues, gaps in care and management

of certain chronic health conditions. Our digital strategy empowers the consumer to navigate their pharmacy experience and manage their condition through our on-line and mobile tools that offer utility and convenience. This includes the ability to schedule an appointment at MinuteClinic, get next-in line alerts or health reminders and appointment updates via text messages. Our integrated digital offerings help patients seamlessly manage retail, mail and specialty prescriptions dispensed by a CVS Pharmacy or long-term care location and enhance front store personalization to drive value for customers. We experienced strong adoption of our digital solutions with our mobile app receiving critical acclaim for ease of use and our text message program experiencing significant growth. LTC s Digital Technology suite, Omniview       , improves the efficiency of customers  operations with tools that include executive dashboards, pre-admission pricing, electronic ordering of prescription refills, proof-of-delivery tracking, access to patient profiles, receipt and management of facility bills, and real-time validation of Medicare Part D coverage, among other capabilities.  
    
  Retail/LTC Customers   - The success of our retail drugstore and long-term care businesses is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers and other payors on acceptable terms. Pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, government-funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third party payors accounted for 98.9% of our 2016 pharmacy revenues. No single Retail/LTC payor accounts for 10% or more of our annual consolidated net revenues.  
    
  Retail/LTC Seasonality   - The majority of our revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, are generally not seasonal in nature. However, retail front store revenues tend to be higher during the December holiday season. In addition, both pharmacy and retail front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season. For additional information, we refer you to  Risks related to the seasonality of our business  in Item 1A. Risk Factors.  
    
  Retail/LTC Competition   - The retail drugstore business is highly competitive. We believe that we compete principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience, (ii) customer service and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety, and (iv) price. In the markets we serve, we compete with other drugstore chains (e.g., Walgreens and Rite Aid), supermarkets, discount retailers (e.g., Wal-Mart), independent pharmacies, restrictive pharmacy networks, membership clubs, Internet companies, and retail health clinics (including urgent care centers), as well as other mail order pharmacies.  
    
  LTC pharmaceutical services are highly regional or local in nature and within a given geographic area of operation, highly competitive. Our largest competitor nationally is PharMerica. We also compete with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned by long-term care facilities and local retail pharmacies. Some states have enacted  freedom of choice  or  any willing provider  requirements as part of their state medicaid programs or in separate legislation, which may increase the competition that we face in providing services to long-term care facility residents in these states. 
    
  Corporate Segment 
    
  Our Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the overall operations of the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of our executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments. 
    
  Generic Sourcing Venture 
    
  In 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ( Cardinal ) established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ( Red Oak ), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own 50%. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company.  
    
  Working Capital Practices 
    
  We fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and long-term borrowings. For additional information on our working capital practices, we refer you to the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources  in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016, which section is incorporated by reference herein. The majority of our non-pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards. Managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, government-funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third party insurance programs, which represent the vast majority of our consolidated pharmacy revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. With the exception of our Medicare Part D services, the remainder of our consolidated pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards. As a provider of Medicare Part D services, we contract annually with CMS. Utilization of  
  
   9 

services each plan year results in the accumulation of either a receivable from or a payable to CMS. The timing of settlement of the receivable or payable with CMS may take several quarters which impacts our working capital from year to year. 
    
  Colleague Development 
    
  As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 250,000 colleagues, which included approximately 36,000 pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The total included approximately 92,000 part-time colleagues who work less than 30 hours per week. To deliver the highest levels of service to our customers, we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards. We emphasize attracting and training knowledgeable, friendly and helpful associates to work in our organization. 
    
  Intellectual Property 
    
  We have registered and/or applied to register a variety of our trademarks and service marks used throughout our business, as well as domain names, and rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, in addition to contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value in our Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments. We are not aware of any facts that could materially impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property. 
    
  Government Regulation 
    
  Overview   - Much of our business is subject to federal and state laws and regulations. In addition, many of our PBM clients and our payors in the Retail/LTC Segment, including insurers, Medicare Part D plans, Managed Medicaid plans and managed care organizations ( MCOs ), are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor. Similarly, our LTC clients, such as skilled nursing facilities, are subject to government regulations, including many of the same government regulations to which we are subject. The application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty. Further, there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels, some of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted. We are unable to predict what federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general, or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on our business. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations as summarized below, or any adverse applications of, or changes in, the laws and regulations affecting our business, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and/or financial condition. See Item 3,  Legal Proceedings  for further information. 
    
  Although we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our various business lines, we cannot give any assurances that our business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected, or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations, including the laws and regulations described in this Government Regulation section, as they may relate to our business, the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or to the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally; (iv) institution of government enforcement actions against us; (v) adverse developments in any pending   qui tam   lawsuit against us, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future   qui tam   lawsuit that may be filed against us; or (vi) adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally. 
    
  Laws and Regulations Related to Each Operating Segment of Our Business 
    
  Laws Related to Reimbursement by Government Programs   - We are subject to various state and federal laws concerning our submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored health care programs. Potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, multiples damages, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act ( FCA ), the federal Anti-Kickback statute, various state false claims acts and anti-kickback statutes, the federal  Stark Law  and related state laws. In particular, the FCA prohibits intentionally submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively,  ACA ), the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended in 2010 to provide that any claim for government reimbursement violates the FCA where it results from a  
  
   10 

violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file   qui tam   or  whistleblower  lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government. Further, the federal Stark Law generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient prescription drugs, to any entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral. Various states have enacted similar laws. 
    
  The 21st Century Cures Act ( Cures Act ), enacted in December 2016, among other things shifted payment for Medicare Part B durable medical equipment ( DME ) infused drugs from one pricing benchmark to another as of January 1, 2017. This change, depending upon the particular drug, is expected to cause both increases and decreases in reimbursement, although the overall impact is expected to be negative. In addition, the change in presidential administration has caused uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Cures Act, meaning that the full impact of this new law on the Company is uncertain. 
    
  Anti-Remuneration Laws   - Federal law prohibits, among other things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject to certain exceptions and  safe harbors,  any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal health care programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment, criminal and civil fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored health care programs.  
    
  Antitrust and Unfair Competition   - The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTCA ) to investigate and prosecute practices that are  unfair trade practices  or  unfair methods of competition.  Numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies and/or PBMs under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging, among other things: (i) brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, (ii) the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by PBMs, and (iii) various other business practices of PBMs and retail pharmacies. To the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or CVS Pharmacy or CVS Specialty plays a unique or expanded role in a PBM product offering, our business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anti-competitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties.  
    
  Privacy and Confidentiality Requirements   - Many of our activities involve the receipt, use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information ( PII ) as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws, which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information. In addition to PII, we use and disclose de-identified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted. Additionally, there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit     credit card information maintain a secure environment. Certain states have recently incorporated these requirements into state laws. 
    
  The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively,  HIPAA ) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, health care providers, health care clearinghouses (known as  covered entities ) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information ( PHI ). Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with HIPAA standards. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the  HITECH Act ), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, amended HIPAA to impose additional restrictions on third-party funded communications using PHI and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for PHI. It also extended HIPAA privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates. In addition to HIPAA, state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA. 
    
  Finally, the Health Insurance Marketplaces (formerly known as the  exchanges ) are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to PII, and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of PII as those the Health Insurance Marketplace has implemented for itself or non-Health Insurance Marketplace entities, which include insurers offering plans through the Health Insurance Marketplaces and their designated downstream entities, including PBMs and other business associates. These standards may differ from, and be more stringent than, HIPAA. 
    
  Consumer Protection Laws   - The federal government has many consumer protection laws, such as the FTCA, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. These laws have been the basis for investigations, lawsuits and multi-state settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing  
  
   11 

of loyalty programs and health care services, pricing accuracy, expired front store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs and disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected. 
    
  Government Agreements and Mandates   - The Company and/or its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees, settlement agreements, corrective action plans and corporate integrity agreements with various federal, state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices, controlled substances, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, expired products, environmental and safety matters, marketing and advertising practices, PBM, long term care and pharmacy operations and various other business practices. These agreements may contain certain ongoing reporting, monitoring or other compliance requirements for the Company. Failure to meet the Company s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies, financial penalties, administrative remedies, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. 
    
  Environmental and Safety Regulation   - Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment, public health and employee safety, including, for example, regulations governing the management of hazardous substances, the cleaning up of contaminated sites, and the maintenance of safe working conditions in our stores, distribution centers and other facilities. Governmental agencies on the federal, state and local levels have, in recent years, increasingly focused on the retail and health care sectors  compliance with such laws and regulations, and have at times pursued enforcement activities. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities. 
    
  Health Reform Legislation   - Passed in 2010, ACA affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country. In addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage, ACA enacted a number of significant health care reforms. Many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients. As a result, these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices. Some significant ACA provisions are still being finalized (e.g., nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage) and all or parts of ACA may be repealed or replaced, so the full impact of ACA on our Company is still uncertain. 
    
  Pharmacy and Professional Licensure and Regulation   - We are subject to a variety of intersecting state and federal statutes and regulations that govern the wholesale distribution of drugs; operation of retail, specialty, infusion, LTC and mail order pharmacies; licensure of facilities and professionals, including pharmacists, technicians and nurses; registration of facilities with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and analogous state agencies that regulate controlled substances; packaging, storing, shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals; repackaging of drug products; labeling, medication guides and other consumer disclosures; interactions with prescribers and health care professionals; compounding of prescription medications; dispensing of controlled and non-controlled substances; counseling of patients; transfers of prescriptions; advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services; security; inventory control; recordkeeping; reporting to Boards of Pharmacy, the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the DEA and related state agencies; and other elements of pharmacy practice. Pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with a wide variety of local, state and federal agencies, with various powers to investigate, inspect, audit or solicit information, including Boards of Pharmacy and Nursing, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Justice, the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and others. Many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers, conduct audits on a regular basis, can impose substantial fines and penalties, and may revoke the license, registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional.  
    
  Telemarketing and Other Outbound Contacts   - Certain federal and state laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. 

12 

Laws and Regulations Related to Our Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole, we are subject to federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our Pharmacy Services Segment specifically. Among these are the following: 
    
  PBM Laws and Regulation   - Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states. This legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect. 
    
  In addition, certain quasi-regulatory organizations, including the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBM activities. Similarly, credentialing organizations such as NCQA and URAC may establish voluntary standards regarding PBM, mail or specialty pharmacy activities. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting organizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for PBM or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients and/or the services we provide to them. 
     
  Medicare Part D   - The Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through private insurers, regulates all aspects of the provision of Medicare drug coverage, including enrollment, formularies, pharmacy networks, marketing, and claims processing. The Medicare Part D program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception, and continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny. The applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve. CMS has imposed restrictions and issued new requirements to protect Medicare Part D beneficiaries and has used its authority to sanction and impose civil monetary penalties on plans for non-compliance. 
    
  Network Access Legislation   - Medicare Part D and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. For example, certain  any willing provider  legislation may require us or our clients to admit a non-participating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation. These laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network. 
    
  Also, a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability (and the health plans  ability) to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to us for payment. These laws could negatively impact our ability to recover overpayments in health care payments stemming from pharmacy audits. Lastly, several states have passed legislation regulating our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs ( MAC ) for generic prescription drugs. MAC methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors (including CMS) to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs. MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies, the kinds of drugs that a PBM can pay at a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could negatively impact our ability to establish MAC prices for generic drugs.  
    
  Contract Audits   - We are subject to audits of many of our contracts, including our PBM client contracts, our PBM rebate contracts, our PBM network contracts, our contracts relating to Medicare Part D and the agreements our pharmacies enter into with other payors. Because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies, audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs, including those which operate Medicaid fee for service plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare Part D plans or Medicare Advantage organizations.  
    
  Federal Employee Health Benefits Program   - We have a contractual arrangement with carriers for the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal workers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act ( FEHBA ) and as part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. These arrangements subjects us to certain aspects of FEHBA, and other federal regulations, such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation, that otherwise are not applicable to us. 
    
  State Insurance Laws   - PDPs and our PBM service contracts, including those in which we assume certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements, are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states. However, state  
  
   13 

departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of PBM activities due to legislation passing in several states requiring PBMs to register or obtain a license with the department. Rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a few states with the areas of focus on licensure requirements, pharmacy reimbursement for generics (MAC reimbursement) and pharmacy audits - most of which fall under the state insurance code. Additionally, some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company. These state laws vary, and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
    
  As a PDP, SilverScript is subject to state insurance laws limited to licensure and solvency. In addition, PBM offerings of prescription drug coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states. Such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer, establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability. Laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing MCOs and limited prepaid health service plans.  
    
  ERISA Regulation   - The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ), provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans, including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide PBM services. In general, we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors. We do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of ERISA, except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility, such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims and/or the appeals of denied claims under a plan, and with respect to the Contraceptive Coverage Mandate, one of the health reforms presently included in ACA. 
    
  In addition to its fiduciary provisions, ERISA imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received. These provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain. 
    
  Formulary and Plan Design Regulation   - A number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. HHS regulates how Medicare Part D formularies are developed and administered, including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories, subject to limited exceptions. Under ACA, CMS imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits, including plans offered through federal or state exchanges. Additionally, NAIC and health care accreditation agencies like NCQA and URAC have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements. Many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. The increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies, networks and other plan design features on behalf of our insurer, MCO and other clients. Similarly, some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive design features. This regulation could limit or preclude (i) limited networks, (ii) a requirement to use particular providers, (iii) copayment differentials among providers and (iv) formulary tiering practices. 
    
  Managed Care Reform   - In addition to health reforms enacted by ACA, proposed legislation has been considered at the state level, and legislation has been enacted in several states, aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans. This legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our PBM health plan clients and/or the services we provide to them. Both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly, and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain. 
    
  Disease Management Services Regulation   - We provide disease management programs to PBM plan members for rare medical conditions and arrange for them to receive disease management programs for common medical conditions. State laws regulate the practice of medicine, the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing. Clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of disease management services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice. 
    
  Third Party Administration and Other State Licensure Laws   - Many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations, such as preferred provider organizations, third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services. Several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs (also known as cash card or discount card programs).

Laws and Regulations Related to Our Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole, we are subject to federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our Retail/LTC Segment specifically. Among these are the following: 
    
  Specific FDA Regulation   - The FDA generally has authority to, among other things, regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and labeling of many products sold through retail pharmacies, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, medical devices (including mobile medical devices), cosmetics, dietary supplements and certain food items. 
    
  Retail Clinics   - States regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight, lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine. A number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight, signage, third party contracting requirements, bathroom facilities, and scope of services. These laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of our owned and managed retail clinics.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  Our business is subject to various industry, economic, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial: 
    
  Risks of declining gross margins in the PBM, retail pharmacy and LTC pharmacy industries. 
    
  The PBM industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices, increased revenue sharing, enhanced service offerings and/or higher service levels. In that regard, we maintain contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Manufacturer rebates often depend on a PBM s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements, including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer s products on the PBM s formularies. If we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Further, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail  differential  or  spread , which could negatively impact our future profitability. Further, changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, or to formulary management or other PBM services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive. In addition, changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing, including our ability to use MAC lists and collect transmission fees, could adversely impact our profitability. 
    
  Our retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and LTC pharmacy operations have also been affected by the margin pressures described above, including client demands for lower prices, generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure. In addition, as competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. A shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our margins, including the shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day prescriptions at retail and the shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions.  
  
   15 

Finally, the margins of our LTC business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements. These actions could also adversely affect the margins of our LTC business. 
    
  Efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices. 
    
  The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBMs, government entities, and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may impact our profitability. In particular, increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs) has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail, specialty, LTC and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in the generic profit rate. Historically, the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers. However, in recent years, there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry, and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased costs or to modify our activities to lessen the impact could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. 
    
  In addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels. Efforts to control health care costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuing at the federal and state government levels. Changing political, economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices. For example, we anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems, payment methodologies and operational requirements for health care providers, including LTC facilities and pharmacies. A change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability. Any action taken to repeal or replace all or significant parts of ACA could also impact our profitability, though it is unclear at this time what the full effects will be. 
    
  ACA made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and to reimbursement. One of these changes was to revise the definition of the Average Manufacturer Price, a pricing element common to most payment formulas, and the reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs. This change has negatively affected our reimbursement. In addition, ACA made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients, including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees. These ACA changes may not affect our business directly, but they could indirectly impact our services and/or business practices. 
    
  A highly competitive business environment. 
    
  Each of our retail pharmacy, LTC pharmacy, retail health clinic and pharmacy services operations currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment.  
    
  The competitive success of our retail pharmacy business, as well as our specialty pharmacy operations with non-Caremark payors, is derived by their ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms in an environment where some PBM clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks. As a pharmacy retail business, we compete with other drugstore chains, supermarkets, on-line and other discount retailers, independent pharmacies, membership clubs, convenience stores and mass merchants, some of which are aggressively expanding into markets we serve. We also face competition from other retail health clinics, as well as other mail order pharmacies and PBMs. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. Changes in market dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation, the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, and the exclusion from new narrow or restricted networks, could materially and adversely impact us. 
    
  We could also be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. For example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy operations focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. 
    
  The competitive success of our LTC pharmacy operations is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operations. In the geographic regions we serve, we compete with PharMerica Corporation, our largest  
  
   16 

competitor, as well as with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned by LTC facilities and local retail pharmacies. 
    
  The competitive success of our pharmacy services business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some PBM clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks. Competitors in the PBM industry (e.g., Express Scripts, OptumRx, Prime Therapeutics, MedImpact and Humana), include large, national PBM companies, PBMs owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone PBMs. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. In addition, changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could adversely affect our claims volume and/or our competitiveness generally. 
    
  Competitors in each of our business areas may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer. Strong competition in the PBM marketplace has generated greater client demand for lower pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. Unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings, particularly in a rapidly changing health care industry, we may be unable to remain competitive. 
    
  Changes in U.S. policy, laws and regulations, including reform of the United States health care system. 
    
  The results of the November 2016 elections have generated uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care and retail industries. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take (including through the use of Executive Orders), specific proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations include, but are not limited to, immigration policies, the repeal of all or part of ACA and other significant changes to health care system legislation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries.  
    
  The repeal of all or part of the ACA, significant changes to Medicaid funding or even significant destabilization of the Health Insurance Marketplaces could impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage. Even if ACA remains, significant provisions of ACA have not yet been finalized (e.g., nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage) and it is uncertain whether or in what form these provisions will be finalized. We cannot predict the effect, if any, a repeal of all or part of ACA, the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of ACA, or the enactment of new health care system legislation to replace current legislation may have on our retail pharmacy, LTC pharmacy and pharmacy services operations. 
    
  In addition, much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our retail, mail and specialty pharmacies, and much of the other merchandise we sell, is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the United States. In most cases, the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us. As a result, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could result in significant increases in our costs, restrict our access to suppliers, depress economic activity, and have a material impact on our business, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes as well as any negative sentiments towards the United States in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade regulations could adversely affect our business. 
    
  Finally, comprehensive tax reform is likely to be considered in the current political environment. We expect that tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant impact on the Company. Current proposals aim to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to as low as 15% or 20%, but generally broaden the base to which the lower tax rate would apply. Many aspects of tax reform plans remain unknown though, and no proposed legislation has been filed. We cannot say with certainty if tax reform will be enacted, or how it would impact the Company. 
    
  Risks related to compliance with a broad and complex regulatory framework.    
    
  Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. See  Business - Government Regulation.  In addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels. Further, uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business. In addition, it is possible that all, or certain provision of the current health care reform legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated. Changes in these laws and regulations and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to  
  
   17 

implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; significant fines or monetary penalties; suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; or loss of registrations or licensure. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: the laws and regulations described in the Government Regulation section; accounting standards; financial disclosure; securities laws and regulations; federal anti-trust laws; tax laws and regulations and their possible reform; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous materials and wastes; and laws and regulations of the FTC, the FCC, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products that we sell, such as Boards of Pharmacy. The FDA, DEA and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various states  controlled substances acts and their accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses, seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, our business interests outside of the United States are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. We are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates, including those described in the Government Regulation section. In that regard, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new government legislative, regulatory action and enforcement activity, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following: 

federal and state laws and regulations concerning the submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs, whether at retail, mail, specialty or LTC; 
                
    federal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, tracking, management, compounding, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services, whether at retail, mail, specialty or LTC, and applicable registration or licensing requirements; 
                
    heighted enforcement of controlled substances regulations; 
                
    the effect of the expiration of patents covering brand name drugs and the introduction of generic products; 
                
    the frequency and rate of approvals by the FDA of new brand name and generic drugs, or of over-the-counter status for brand name drugs; 
                
    rules and regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and the HITECH Act; and other federal and state laws affecting the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of health or other personal information, such as federal laws on information privacy precipitated by concerns about information collection through the Internet, state security breach laws and state laws limiting the use and disclosure of prescriber information; 
                
    health care fraud and abuse laws regulations; 
                
    consumer protection laws affecting our health care services, our loyalty programs, our drug discount card programs, the products we sell, the informational calls we make and/or the marketing of our goods and services; 
                
    federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, including the management of hazardous substances, storage and transportation of hazardous materials, and various recordkeeping disclosure and procedure requirements promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that may apply to our operations; 
                
    health care reform, managed care reform and plan design legislation; 
                
    laws against the corporate practice of medicine; 
                
    FDA regulation affecting the retail, LTC, specialty or PBM industry; 
                
    government regulation of the development, administration, review and updating of formularies and drug lists including requirements and/or limitations around formulary tiering and patient cost sharing; 
                
    state laws and regulations related to increased oversight of PBM activities by state departments of insurance pharmacy reimbursement for generics and pharmacy audits; 
                
    drug pricing legislation, including  most favored nation  pricing; 
                
    federal and state laws and regulations establishing or changing prompt payment requirements for payments to retail pharmacies; 
                
    impact of network access legislation or regulations, including  any willing provider  laws, on our ability to manage pharmacy networks; 
                
    ERISA and related regulations; 
                
    administration of Medicare Part D, including legislative changes and/or CMS rulemaking and interpretation; 
                
    Medicare and Medicaid regulations applicable to our business, in particular our LTC pharmacies and those of our client s facilities; 
     
   18 

ongoing compliance with consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, corrective action plans and other agreements with government agencies;  
                
    insurance licensing and other insurance regulatory requirements applicable to offering Medicare Part D programs and services or other health care services; and 
                
    direct regulation of pharmacies or PBMs by regulatory and quasi-regulatory bodies. 
       
  The possibility of client losses and/or the failure to win new business. 
    
  Our PBM business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. PBM client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration, so approximately one third of a PBM s client base typically is subject to renewal each year. In some cases, however, PBM clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract. Our clients are generally well informed and organized, can easily move between our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration of their contracts. In addition, the reputational impact of a service-related incident could negatively affect our business. These factors, together with the impact of competitive pressures, could make it difficult for us to attract new clients, retain existing clients and cross-sell additional services. Further, the PBM industry has been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future. In the event one or more of our PBM clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client, we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business. These circumstances, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Therefore, we continually face challenges in competing for new PBM business and retaining or renewing our existing PBM business. With respect to our LTC business, reimbursement from skilled nursing facilities for prescriptions we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreements with those skilled nursing facilities. The termination of these agreements generally causes our ability to provide services to any of the residents of that facility to cease, resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those residents. There can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms. 
    
  Additionally, with respect to our retail and LTC pharmacy businesses, reimbursement under Medicare Part D, as well as reimbursement from certain private third-party payors, is determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representatives. The loss of those agreements, or a material change in the terms of those agreements, could negatively impact the Company. In addition, restricted networks that exclude our retail or specialty pharmacies negatively impact those businesses.  
    
  Risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction and pricing of generic drugs and brand name prescription products. 
    
  The profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products, as the sale of generic alternatives normally yield higher gross margins than brand name equivalents. In addition, inflation in the price of the brand name drugs can affect utilization, particularly given the increase in high deductible health plans. Accordingly, our business could be impacted by a slowdown or delay in the number or magnitude of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals and/or generic alternatives, as well as the pricing of brand name drugs. 
    
  The health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve. 
    
  Our business is affected by the economy and consumer confidence in general, including various economic factors, inflation and changes in consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns. It is possible that an unfavorable, uncertain or volatile economic environment will cause a decline in drug and health care services utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores. Further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations, changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute sale-leaseback transactions under acceptable terms. These changes in conditions could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. This could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health plan designs favoring co-insurance over co-payments. 

19 

The failure or disruption of our information technology systems, our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of     sensitive customer and business information. 
    
  Many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected, processed, stored, and handled by these systems. We rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, claims processing, ExtraCare customer loyalty program, finance, human resource and other processes. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain confidential information, including PII that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services, enroll in programs or services, register on our websites, interact with our personnel, or otherwise communicate with us. In addition, for these operations, we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, coordinated cyber attacks, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities, including ones from a cyber security standpoint, designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Moreover, a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payors and vendors. 
    
  If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our PBM claims adjudication platforms, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience reputational damage, loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. In addition, compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. 
    
  Risks relating to the market availability, suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell. 
    
  We dispense significant volumes of brand-name and generic drugs from our retail, LTC, specialty and mail-order pharmacies and through our PBM s network of retail pharmacies. When increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur, or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances, physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced. 
    
  Additionally, adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs. On occasion, products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to over-the-counter products, which can result in lower prescription utilization. In addition, future FDA rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers. Our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes. 
    
  Further, we acquire a substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacies  prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers. Our agreements with these suppliers are often short-term and easily cancelable by either party without cause. In addition, these agreements may limit our ability to provide services for competing drugs during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than ours. Certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels. A termination or modification to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, many products distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages.  
    
  A disruption in our business operations could occur as a result of contamination of drugs, a failure to maintain necessary shipment and storage conditions, errors in mail order processing, the unavailability of prescription drugs provided by suppliers, labor disruptions or other unanticipated disruptions at our mail order facilities, call centers, data centers or corporate facilities, among other factors. Such disruption could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our customers. 
  
   20 

In the event any products we distribute are in limited supply for significant periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
    
  Regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in Medicare Part D. 
    
  Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization and puts pressure on pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures. Further, as a result of ACA and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules, our PBM clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D business. In addition, if the cost and complexity of Medicare Part D exceed management s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; if changes to the regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; if the government alters Medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; if Congress acts to reduce reinsurance thresholds from 80% to 20%; if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to Medicare participants; if CMS imposes restrictions on our Medicare Part D business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions; if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by CMS; or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees, or winning contract renewals or new contracts under Medicare Part D s competitive bidding process, our Medicare Part D services and the ability to expand our Medicare Part D services could be negatively impacted. 
    
  Possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally. 
    
  It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace Average Wholesale Price ( AWP ) or Wholesale Acquisition Cost ( WAC ), which are the pricing references used for many of our PBM and LTC client contracts, pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs ( FFS Medicaid ) are expected to establish pharmacy network payments on the basis of Actual Acquisition Cost ( AAC ) by April 1, 2017. This move to an AAC basis in FFS Medicaid could have an impact in reimbursement practices in other commercial and government segments. Future changes to the use of AWP, WAC or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs, the reimbursement we receive from PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs and retail pharmacies. A failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time. 
    
  Product liability, product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation; failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage. 
    
  The products that we sell could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling, recall or other damage. In addition, errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our business involves the provision of professional services including by pharmacists, nurses and nurse practitioners that exposes us to professional liability claims. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and the demand for our products and services, including propriety brands. 
    
  The success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty, superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores and online sites and to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, and evolving demographic mixes in our markets, an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers, or the  
  
   21 

failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products. 
    
  We offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites. The sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls, potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products, our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties, and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell private-label products. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which, consequently, could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, that customer confidence is not diminished. Any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty. 
    
  Moreover, customer expectations and new technology advances from our competitors have required that our business evolve so that we are able to engage with our retail customers not only face-to-face in our stores but also online and via mobile and social media. Our customers are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online, as well as to provide public reactions concerning each facet of our operation. If we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectations and new technology developments, our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected. 
    
  Finally, our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients. As a result, the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations. 
    
  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, mobile payments and potentially other technologies in the future. Acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment options, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and various other forms of electronic payment. If these companies are unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, our operations could be disrupted. The payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to, or exploit any weaknesses in, the payment systems. If we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements, or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse, we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition, our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our results of operations. 
    
  We may be unable to successfully integrate companies acquired by us. 
    
  Upon the closing of any acquisition we complete, we will need to successfully integrate the products, services and related assets, as well as internal controls into our business operations. If an acquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, its products, services and related assets into our company may also be complex and time-consuming and, if the integration is not fully successful, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following: 

Integrating personnel, operations and systems, while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent, high quality products and services; 
                
    Coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; 
                
    Disruption of management s attention from our ongoing business operations; 
                
    Retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; and 
     
   22 

Managing inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations. 
       
  An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies, innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. Furthermore, these acquisitions, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products, services or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them. 
    
  Our outstanding debt and associated payment obligations could, among other things, limit our ability to make incremental investments in our business. 
    
  Our current debt service costs associated with our increased debt levels may dampen incremental investments in our business and limit our     flexibility to respond to industry changes and market conditions. In addition, our debt level and related debt service obligations could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any required future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes. Moreover, we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or otherwise access the capital markets for any reason, whether due to market conditions or otherwise. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. 
    
  Risks related to the seasonality of our business. 
    
  Although the majority of our revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, are generally not seasonal in nature, front store revenues tend to be higher during the December holiday season. Uncharacteristic or extreme weather conditions can adversely impact consumer shopping patterns as well. This could lead to lost sales, as well as increased snow removal and other costs, thereby negatively affecting our short-term results of operations. In addition, both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which is susceptible to large fluctuations from year to year, and our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. See  Business - Pharmacy Services Seasonality.  
    
  Risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings. 
    
  Pharmacy services, retail pharmacy and LTC pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries. We are currently subject to various litigation matters, investigations, audits, inspections, government inquiries, and regulatory and legal proceedings. Litigation, and particularly securities and collective or class action litigation, is often expensive and disruptive. Further, under the   qui tam   or  whistleblower  provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, private citizens may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of  false  claims to federal and/or state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Litigation related to our provision of professional services in our pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, clinics and LTC facilities has also increased as we expand our services along the continuum of health care. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters, and the costs incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, or we may be required to materially change our business practices, as a result of such proceedings. We refer you to Item 3,  Legal Proceedings  for additional information. 
    
  The foregoing is not a comprehensive listing of all possible risks and there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting the business. As such, we refer you to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  which includes our  Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements  at the end of such section, of our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016, which section is incorporated by reference herein.

PART II 

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
    
  Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  CVS.  The table below sets forth the high and low closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the quarterly cash dividends declared per share of common stock during the periods indicated. 

CVS Health has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Company s Board of Directors. As of   February 3, 2017  , there were 22,164 registered shareholders according to the records maintained by our transfer agent. 
    
  The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2016 and 2014 Repurchase Programs may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.  
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective August 29, 2016, the Company entered into   two   fixed dollar ASRs with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ) for a total of   $3.6 billion  . Upon payment of the   $3.6 billion   purchase price on January 6, 2017, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $3.6 billion   notional amount of the ASRs or approximately   36.1 million   shares at a price of   $80.34   per share, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2017. At the conclusion of the ASRs, the Company may receive additional shares equal to the remaining   20%   of the   $3.6 billion   notional amount. The ultimate number of shares the Company may receive will fluctuate based on changes in the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock over a period beginning on January 6, 2017 and ending on or before July 6, 2017. If the mean daily volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock, less a discount (the  forward price ), during the ASRs falls below   $80.34   per share, the Company will receive a higher number of shares from Barclays. If the forward price rises above   $80.34   per share, the Company will either receive fewer shares from Barclays or, potentially have an obligation to Barclays which, at the Company's option, could be settled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASRs, the maximum number of shares that could be received or delivered is   90.1 million  . 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a   $725 million   fixed dollar ASR with Barclays. Upon payment of the   $725 million   purchase price on December 14, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR or approximately   6.2 million   shares. The initial   6.2 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in December 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of $580 million and a forward contract of $145 million. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded  
  
   28 

within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet. On January 28, 2016, the Company received   1.4 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   1.4 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in January 2016 and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2013 Repurchase Program, effective January 2, 2015, the Company entered into a   $2.0 billion   fixed dollar ASR agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( JP Morgan ). Upon payment of the   $2.0 billion   purchase price on January 5, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately   16.8 million   shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2015. On May 1, 2015, the Company received approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   3.1 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by JP Morgan were placed into treasury stock in May 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of   $1.6 billion   and a forward contract of   $0.4 billion  . The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was initially recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet and was reclassified to treasury stock upon the settlement of the ASR in May 2015.  
    
  In the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude the ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.  
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased an aggregate of   47.5 million   shares of common stock for approximately   $4.5 billion   under the 2014 Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2016, there remained an aggregate of approximately   $18.2 billion   available for future repurchases under the 2016 and 2014 Repurchase Programs,   $3.6 billion   of which was used for the ASR effective January 6, 2017 described previously. As of December 31, 2015, the 2013 Repurchase Program was complete.

    Disbursement of the Proceeds of the Loans 
     The Administrative Agent shall disburse the proceeds of the Loans at its office specified in   Section 11.2   by crediting to the Borrower the funds received from each Lender.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received prior notice from a Lender (by telephone or otherwise, such notice to be confirmed by fax, email or other writing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Credit Loans to be made by it on a Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date in accordance with this   Section 3.1  ,   provided   that, in the case of a Revolving Credit Loan, such Lender received notice thereof from the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand, such corresponding amount (to the extent not previously paid by the other), together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to, in the case of the Borrower, the applicable interest rate set forth in   Section 3.4(a)   and, in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date such payment is due until the third day after such date and, thereafter, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate   plus   2%.  Any such payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to its rights against such Lender.

The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such time shall not constitute a default hereunder,   provided   that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 1:00 P.M. on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, for the purpose of calculating interest on amounts outstanding on the Loans.  If the Borrower has not made any such payment prior to 1:00 P.M., the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deduct the amount of any such payment from such account(s) as the Borrower may from time to time designate in writing to the Administrative Agent, upon which the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such deduction to such payment.  Promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, each payment of principal and interest on the Revolving Credit Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender (a) first, pro rata according to the amount of interest which is then due and payable to the Lenders, and (b) second, pro rata according to the amount of principal which is then due and payable to the Lenders.  Each payment of the Facility Fee payable to the Lenders shall be promptly transmitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender pro rata according to such Lender s Commitment Amount or, if the Commitments shall have terminated or been terminated, according to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender s Revolving Credit Loans.  
  (b)        If any payment hereunder or under the Loans shall be due and payable on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, the due date thereof (except as otherwise provided in the definition of Eurodollar Interest Period) shall be extended to the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, and (except with respect to payments in respect of the Facility Fee) interest shall be payable at the applicable rate specified herein during such extension. 
   
           3.3 
    Conversions; Other Matters 
     (a)        The Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert one or more Eurodollar Advances to an ABR Advance by giving the Administrative Agent at least one Domestic Business Day s prior irrevocable notice of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted.  In addition, the Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert an ABR Advance to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances or to Convert any one or more existing Eurodollar Advances to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances by giving the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. at least two Eurodollar Business Days  prior irrevocable notice, in the case of a Conversion to Eurodollar Advances, of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted and the initial Interest Period relating thereto,   provided   that any Conversion of an ABR Advance to Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on a Eurodollar Business Day.  The  
  
   24 
  CVS Health Corporation 2017 Credit Agreement 
  008330-0373-Active.20553774 

Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Lenders with notice of each such election.  Each Conversion of Loans from one Type to another shall be made pro rata according to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.  ABR Advances and Eurodollar Advances may be Converted pursuant to this   Section 3.3   in whole or in part,   provided   that the amount to be Converted to each Eurodollar Advance, when aggregated with any Eurodollar Advance to be made on such date in accordance with   Section 2.1   and having the same Interest Period as such first Eurodollar Advance, shall equal no less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 
  (b)        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower shall not have the right to elect to Convert any existing ABR Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance or to Convert any existing Eurodollar Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance if (i) a Default or Event of Default under   Section 9.1(a)  ,   Section 9.1(b)  ,   Section 9.1(h),     Section 9.1(i)   or   Section 9.1(j)   shall then exist, or (ii) any other Event of Default shall then exist and the Administrative Agent shall have notified the Borrower at the request of the Required Lenders that no ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance may be Converted to a new Eurodollar Advance.  In such event, such ABR Advance shall be automatically continued as an ABR Advance or such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically Converted to an ABR Advance on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance.  The foregoing shall not affect any other rights or remedies that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
  (c)        Each Conversion shall be effected by each Lender by applying the proceeds of each new ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance, as the case may be, to the existing Advance (or portion thereof) being Converted (it being understood that such Conversion shall not constitute a borrowing for purposes of   Section 4   or   Section 6  ). 
  (d)        Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document: 
  (i)        if the Borrower shall have failed to elect a Eurodollar Advance under   Section 2.3   or this   Section 3.3  , as the case may be, in connection with any borrowing of new Revolving Credit Loans or expiration of an Interest Period with respect to any existing Eurodollar Advance, the amount of the Revolving Credit Loans subject to such borrowing or such existing Eurodollar Advance shall thereafter be an ABR Advance until such time, if any, as the Borrower shall elect a new Eurodollar Advance pursuant to this   Section 3.3  , 
  (ii)        the Borrower shall not be permitted to select a Eurodollar Advance the Interest Period in respect of which ends later than the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been terminated in accordance with   Section 2.6  , and 
  (iii)        the Borrower shall not be permitted to have more than 15 Eurodollar Advances, in the aggregate, outstanding at any one time, it being understood and agreed that each borrowing of Eurodollar Advances pursuant to a single Borrowing Request shall constitute the making of one Eurodollar Advance for the purpose of calculating such limitation.

3.4 
    Interest Rates and Payment Dates 
     (a)        Prior to Maturity  .  Except as otherwise provided in   Section 3.4(b)   and   Section 3.4(c)  , the Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance thereof at the applicable interest rate or rates per annum set forth below: 
                 LOANS 
    RATE 
      Revolving Credit Loans constituting ABR Advances 
    Alternate Base Rate applicable thereto   plus   the Applicable Margin. 
      Revolving Credit Loans constituting Eurodollar Advances 
    Eurodollar Rate applicable thereto   plus   the Applicable Margin. 

(b)        After Maturity, Late Payment Rate  .  After maturity, whether by acceleration, notice of intention to prepay or otherwise, the outstanding principal balance of each Loan shall bear interest at the applicable interest rate on such Loan   plus   2% per annum until paid (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon).  Any payment of principal or interest on the Loans, Fees or other amounts payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents not paid on the date when due and payable shall bear interest, in the case of principal or interest on a Loan, at the applicable interest rate on such Loan   plus   2% per annum and, in the case of any Fees or other amounts, at the Alternate Base Rate   plus   the Applicable Margin   plus   2% per annum, in each case from the due date thereof until the date such payment is made (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon). 
  (c)        Highest Lawful Rate  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at no time shall the interest rate payable to any Lender on any of its Loans, together with the Fees and all other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender to the extent the same constitute or are deemed to constitute interest, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.  If in respect of any period during the term of this Agreement, any amount paid to any Lender hereunder, to the extent the same shall (but for the provisions of this   Section 3.4  ) constitute or be deemed to constitute interest, would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period (such amount being hereinafter referred to as an    Unqualified Amount   ), then (i) such Unqualified Amount shall be applied or shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans of such Lender, and (ii) if, in any subsequent period during the term of this Agreement, all amounts payable hereunder to such Lender in respect of such period which constitute or shall be deemed to constitute interest shall be less than the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender in respect of such period an amount (each a    Compensatory Interest Payment   ) equal to the lesser of (x) a sum which, when added to all such amounts, would equal the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate sum of all Unqualified Amounts   less   all other Compensatory Interest Payments. 
  (d)        General  .  Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, on the Commitment Termination Date and, to the extent provided in   Section 2.7(b)  , upon each  
  
   26 
  CVS Health Corporation 2017 Credit Agreement 
  008330-0373-Active.20553774 

prepayment of the Loans.  Any change in the interest rate on the Loans resulting from an increase or a decrease in the Alternate Base Rate or any reserve requirement shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change shall become effective.  The Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each change in the Prime Rate, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the amounts and on the dates set forth herein.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the Alternate Base Rate and the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent manifest error.  The Borrower acknowledges that to the extent interest payable on the Loans is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the Lenders, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the Alternate Base Rate, the Lenders have not committed to charge, and the Borrower has not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lenders may now or in the future make extensions of credit to other Persons.  All interest (other than interest calculated with reference to the Prime Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed, and all interest determined with reference to the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365/366 day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 
   
           3.5 
    Indemnification for Loss 
     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if: (i) the Borrower shall fail to borrow a Eurodollar Advance or if the Borrower shall fail to Convert a Eurodollar Advance after it shall have given notice to do so in which it shall have requested a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to   Section 2.3   or   Section 3.3  , as the case may be, (ii) [reserved], (iii) a Eurodollar Advance shall be terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (iv) any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of a Eurodollar Advance is made for any reason on a date which is prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (v) the Borrower shall have revoked a notice of prepayment or notice of termination of the Commitments that was conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities pursuant to   Section 2.6   or   Section 2.7  , or (vi) a Eurodollar Advance is assigned other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a replacement of a Lender pursuant to clause (x) or (z) of   Section 3.13  , then the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against, and to pay on demand directly to such Lender the amount (calculated by such Lender using any method chosen by such Lender which is customarily used by such Lender for such purpose for borrowers similar to the Borrower) equal to any loss or expense suffered by such Lender as a result of such failure to borrow or Convert, or such termination, repayment, prepayment or revocation, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of such Eurodollar Advance or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which correspond to such Eurodollar Advance and any reasonable internal processing charge customarily charged by such Lender in connection therewith for borrowers similar to the Borrower. 
   
           3.6 
    Reimbursement for Costs, Etc. 
     If at any time or from time to time there shall occur a Regulatory Change and any Lender shall have reasonably determined that such Regulatory Change (i) shall have had or will thereafter have the effect of reducing (A) the rate of return on such Lender s capital or liquidity or the capital or liquidity of any Person directly or indirectly owning or controlling such Lender (each a    Control Person   ), or (B) the asset value (for capital or liquidity purposes) to the such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of the Loans, or any participation therein, in any case to a level below that which such Lender or such Control Person could have achieved or would thereafter be able to achieve but for such Regulatory Change (after taking into account such Lender s or such Control Person s policies regarding capital), (ii) will impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, asset, special deposit or special assessment requirements on deposits obtained in the interbank eurodollar market in connection with the Loan Documents (excluding, with respect to any Eurodollar Advance, any such requirement which is included in the determination of the rate applicable thereto), or (iii) will subject such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, to any tax (documentary, stamp or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement or any Note (except, in the case of clause (iii) above, for any Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes) then, in each such case, within ten days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, for any such reduction, reserve or other requirement, tax, loss, cost or expense (excluding general administrative and overhead costs) (collectively,    Costs   ) attributable to such Lender s or such Control Person s compliance during the term hereof with such Regulatory Change, but only if such Costs are generally applicable to (and for which reimbursement is generally being sought by such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, in respect of) credit transactions similar to this transaction from similarly situated borrowers (which are parties to credit or loan documentation containing a provision similar to this Section 3.6), as determined by such Lender in its reasonable discretion.  Each Lender may make multiple requests for compensation under this   Section 3.6  . 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to compensate any Lender for any Costs under this   Section 3.6   arising prior to 45 days preceding the date of demand, unless the applicable Regulatory Change giving rise to such Costs is imposed retroactively.  In the case of retroactivity, such notice shall be provided to the Borrower not later than 45 days from the date that such Lender learned of such Regulatory Change.  The Borrower s obligation to compensate such Lender shall be contingent upon the provision of such timely notice (but any failure by such Lender to provide such timely notice shall not affect the Borrower s obligations with respect to (i) Costs incurred from the date as of which such Regulatory Change became effective to the date that is 45 days after the date such Lender reasonably should have learned of such Regulatory Change and (ii) Costs incurred following the provision of such notice). 
   
           3.7 
    Illegality of Funding 
     Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Lender shall reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, and (a) the commitment of such Lender to make such Eurodollar Advances or Convert ABR Advances to such Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (b) such Lender shall fund its portion of each requested Eurodollar Advance as an ABR Advance and (c) such Lender s Loans then outstanding as such Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be Converted automatically to an ABR Advance on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto or at such earlier time as may be required.  If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this   Section 3.7   and such Lender shall have obtained actual knowledge that it is once again legal for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof and, upon receipt of such notice by each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, such Lender s commitment to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances shall be reinstated.  If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this   Section 3.7  , such suspension shall not otherwise affect such Lender s Commitment. 

3.9 
    Certificates of Payment and Reimbursement 
     Each Lender agrees, in connection with any request by it for payment or reimbursement pursuant to   Section 3.5   or   Section 3.6  , to provide the Borrower with a certificate, signed by an officer of such Lender, setting forth a description in reasonable detail of any such payment or reimbursement and the applicable Section of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with which such request is made.  Each determination by each Lender of such payment or reimbursement shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
   
   (a)      Payments Free of Taxes  .  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes,   provided   that if any withholding agent shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this   Section 3.10  ) the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes been made, (ii) such withholding agent shall make such deductions and (iii) such withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
  (b)      Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower  .  Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
  (c)      Indemnification by the Borrower  .  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment made by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this   Section 3.10  ) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and, without duplication, any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of such Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  After any Lender learns of the imposition of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, such Lender will as soon as reasonably practicable notify the Borrower thereof;   provided   that the failure to provide Borrower with such notice shall not release the Borrower from its indemnification obligations under this   Section 3.10  . 
  (d)      Evidence of Payments  .  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
  (e)      Status of Lenders  .  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for Tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 
    
  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter (i) if such Foreign Lender shall determine that any applicable form or certification has expired or will then expire or has or will then become obsolete or incorrect or that an event has occurred that requires or will then require a change in the most recent form or certification previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and (ii) upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: 
  (i)    duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E claiming eligibility for benefits of an income Tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party, 
  (ii)    duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, 
  (iii)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate (a    United States Tax Compliance Certificate   ) to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (B) a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, (C) a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code or (D) engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States to which the interest payment is effectively connected and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, 
  (iv)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender granting a typical participation), a complete and executed IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, a United States Tax Compliance Certificate, IRS Form W-9 and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;   provided   that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender shall provide a United States Tax Compliance Certificate, on behalf of such beneficial owner(s) in lieu of requiring each beneficial owner to provide its own certificate, or 
  (v)    any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
  If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.   Solely for purposes of this clause,  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
  Without limiting the foregoing, upon request of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, each Lender that is a  United States person  within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code that lends to the Borrower (each, a    U.S. Lender   ) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower two duly signed, properly completed copies of IRS Form W-9 on or prior to the Effective Date (or on or prior to the date it becomes a party to this Agreement), certifying that such U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding, or any successor form. 
  (f)      Treatment of Certain Refunds  .  If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 3.10  , it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this   Section 3.10   with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),   provided   that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
  (g)      Designation of a Different Lending Office  .  If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 3.6  , or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to this   Section 3.10  , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to   Section 3.6   or this    Section 3.10  , as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
   
   The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of each Lender a fee (the    Facility Fee   ) during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the Expiration Date, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of the year, commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter during which the Facility Fee shall commence to accrue, and on the Expiration Date, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin of (a) prior to the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been terminated in accordance with   Section 2.6  , the Commitment Amount of such Lender (whether used or unused), and (b) thereafter, the sum of the outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Credit Loans of such Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Section 3.11  , on and after the Commitment Termination Date, the Facility Fee shall be payable upon demand.  In addition, upon each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment Amount, the Borrower shall pay the Facility Fee accrued on the amount of such reduction to the date of such reduction.  The Facility Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 

If (x) the Borrower is obligated to pay to any Lender any amount under   Section 3.6   or   Section 3.10  , the Borrower shall have the right within 90 days thereafter, or (y) any Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall have the right at any time during which such Lender shall remain a Defaulting Lender, in each case in accordance with the requirements of   Section 11.7(b)   and only if no Default or Event of Default shall exist, to replace such Lender (the    Replaced Lender   ) with one or more Eligible Assignees (each a    Replacement Lender   ), reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent,   provided   that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this   Section 3.13  , the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Assumptions pursuant to   Section 11.7(b)   (with the processing and recordation fee referred to in   Section 11.7(b)   payable pursuant to said   Section 11.7(b)   to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire the Commitment and the outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay the following: (a) to the Replaced Lender, an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, (B) [reserved], and (C) an amount equal to all accrued, but unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender, and (b) to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to all amounts owed by such Replaced Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, including, without limitation, an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, a corresponding amount of which was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower pursuant to   Section 3.1   and which has not been repaid to the Administrative Agent by such Replaced Lender or the Borrower, and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement.  Upon the execution of the respective Assignment and Acceptance Agreements and the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this   Section 3.13  , the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement that are intended to survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of the Loans which may be applicable to any such Replaced Lender prior to the date of its replacement.  Solely for the purpose of calculating break funding payments under   Section 3.5  , the assignment by any Replaced Lender of any Eurodollar Advance prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto pursuant to clause (x) or (z) of this   Section 3.13   shall be deemed to constitute a prepayment by the Borrower of such Eurodollar Advance. 
   
           4. 
    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
     In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders:

The agreements in this   Section 11.5   shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment of the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. 
   
   Each Lender shall have the right at any time and from time to time to transfer any Loan to a different office of such Lender, subject to   Section 3.10  . 
   
   (a)        Successors and Assigns Generally  .  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (11) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this   Section 11.7  , (11) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this   Section 11.7   or (11) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (f) of this   Section 11.7   (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, the Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this   Section 11.7   and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each Credit Party) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
  (b)        Assignments by Lenders  .  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);   provided   that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:  
  (1)        Minimum Amounts  .   
  (A)    in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment Amount and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
  (B)    in any case not described in paragraph (b)(1)(A) of this   Section 11.7  , the Commitment Amount (which for this purpose includes the Loans of the assigning Lender outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment of the assigning Lender is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans  of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if a  Trade Date  is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of such  Trade Date ) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  
  (2)        Proportionate Amounts  .  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned. 
  (3)        Required Consents  .  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (b)(1)(B) of this   Section 11.7   and, in addition: 
  (A)    the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund;  and 
  (B)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of an unfunded or revolving facility hereunder if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of such facility, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender. 
  (4)        Assignment and Assumption  .  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $4,500 ($7,500 in the case of an assignment by a Defaulting Lender) (which fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent), and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
  (5)        No Assignment to Certain Parties  .  No such assignment shall be made to the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates. 
  (6)        No Assignment to Natural Persons  .  No such assignment shall be made to a natural person. 
  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this   Section 11.7  , from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of   Section 3.6,     Section 3.7  , and   Section 11.10   with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this   Section 11.7  . 
  (c)        Register  .  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York, New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  (d)        Participations  .  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates) (each, a    Participant   ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);   provided   that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Credit Party shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver which requires the consent of all Lenders or all affected Lenders that directly affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (e) of this   Section 11.7  , the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 3.5  ,   Section 3.6  ,   Section 3.7   and   Section 3.10   to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this   Section 11.7  .  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 11.9(a)     as though it were a Lender,   provided   that such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 11.9(b)     as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation with respect to a Commitment or Loan to the Borrower shall, solely for the purposes of complying with the rules regarding registered form in the Internal Revenue Code, act as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintaining a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of each Participant s interest in the Commitment and/or Loan (the    Participant Register   ).  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.    No Lender shall be required to disclose the existence of, or any of the information contained in, any Participant Register maintained by it to the Borrower or any other Person unless requested in writing by the Borrower, and only to the Internal Revenue Service to the extent such disclosure is required in order to comply with the rules requiring registered form pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. 
  (e)        Limitations upon Participant Rights  .  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Section 3.6  ,   Section 3.7   or   Section 3.10   than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent.  A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of   Section 3.10   unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with   Section 3.10(e)   as though it were a Lender.   
  (f)        Certain Pledges  .  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.   
   
           11.8 
    Counterparts; Electronic Execution of Assignments 
     (a)        Counterparts  .  Each of the Loan Documents (other than the Notes) may be executed on any number of separate counterparts and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.  It shall not be necessary in making proof of any Loan Document to produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by the party to be charged.  A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all of the parties hereto shall be lodged with each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of any Loan Document by fax or other electronic means (e.g.,  .pdf  or  .tif ) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of such Loan Document. 
  (b)        Electronic Execution of Assignments  .  The words  execution,   signed,   signature,  and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 
   
   (a)        In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under   Section 9.1(a)   or   Section 9.1(b)   or upon the acceleration of the Loans, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower, to set off and apply against any indebtedness or other liability, whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower to such Lender arising under the Loan Documents, any amount owing from such Lender to the Borrower.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the aforesaid right of set off may be exercised by such Lender against the Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set off shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the making, filing or issuance of, service upon such Lender of, or notice to such Lender of, any petition, assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after each such set off and application made by such Lender,   provided   that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set off and application. 
  (b)        If any Lender (each a    Benefited Lender   ) shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set off, or otherwise) on account of its Loans or its Notes in excess of its pro rata share (in accordance with the outstanding principal balance of all Loans) of payments then due and payable on account of the Loans and Notes received by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase, without recourse, for cash, from the other Lenders such participations in their Loans and Notes as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment with each of them according to their pro rata share (in accordance with the outstanding principal balance of all Loans);   provided   that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender s pro rata share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this   Section 11.9   may exercise such rights to payment (including the right of set off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
   
   (a)        The Borrower shall indemnify each Credit Party, each of the Sole Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger named on the cover page hereof, and each Related Party thereof (each such Person being called an    Indemnified Person   ) against, and hold each Indemnified Person harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and disbursements of one counsel representing all of the Indemnified Persons, taken as a whole, and, if reasonably necessary, of a single local counsel for each applicable jurisdiction (and, if reasonably necessary, one specialty counsel for each applicable specialty), representing all of the Indemnified Persons, taken as a whole (and, in the case of any actual or perceived conflict of interest where the Indemnified Person affected by such conflict notifies the Borrower of the existence of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, of another firm of counsel (and, if reasonably necessary, a single local counsel for each applicable jurisdiction (and, if reasonably necessary, one specialty counsel for each applicable specialty), for each such affected Indemnified Person)), actually incurred by any Indemnified Person arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (11) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or any other transactions contemplated thereby, (11) any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof, (11) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or (11) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Section 11.10(a)  , the foregoing indemnity will not, as to any Indemnified Person, apply to any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses to the extent arising (A) from the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or bad faith of such Indemnified Person, (B) from a material breach of the obligations hereunder of such Indemnified Person, or (C) out of or in connection with any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding that does not involve an act or omission of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates and that is brought by an Indemnified Party against any other Indemnified Party (other than the Sole Bookrunner or Sole Lead Arranger     named on the cover page hereof or the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such), in each case under clauses (A) through (C), to the extent determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement of any investigation, litigation or proceeding to which the indemnity in this   Section 11.10(a)   applies (any of the foregoing, a    Proceeding   ) effected without the Borrower s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being understood and agreed that the withholding or delaying of the Borrower s consent in connection with a settlement which does not include an unconditional release of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding or which includes a statement as to any admission of fault by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall not be deemed unreasonable), but if settled with the Borrower s prior written consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such Proceeding, the Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses by reason of such settlement or judgment in accordance with this   Section 11.10(a)  .  The Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of an Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding against such Indemnified Person in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to any admission of fault by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person.  Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower shall have no liability under clause (i) of this   Section 11.10(a)   to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnified Person for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses relating to income or withholding taxes or any tax in lieu of such taxes. 
  (b)        To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay as soon as practicable any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent     under subsection (a) of this   Section 11.10  , each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the product of such unpaid amount   multiplied by   (i) at any time when no Loans are outstanding, its Commitment Percentage, or if no Commitments then exist, its Commitment Percentage on the last day on which Commitments did exist, and (ii) at any time when Loans are outstanding (x) if the Commitments then exist, its Commitment Percentage or (y) if the Commitments have been terminated or otherwise no longer exist, the percentage equal to the fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the sum of such Lender s Credit Exposure and (B) the denominator of which is the sum of the Aggregate Credit Exposure (in each case determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought),   provided   that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as applicable, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such. 
  (c)        The obligations of the Borrower and the Lenders under this   Section 11.10   shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment of the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. 
  (d)        To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnified Person, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct and actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, any Loan Document or any agreement, instrument or other document contemplated thereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. 
   
   The Loan Documents and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 
   
   Every provision of the Loan Documents is intended to be severable, and if any term or provision thereof shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof shall not be affected or impaired thereby, and any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. 
   
   All exhibits to the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a part thereof.  Each Loan Document embodies the entire agreement and understanding between or among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between or among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof. 
   
   (a)        Each Credit Party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (11) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates  respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (11) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (11) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (11) to any other party hereto, (11) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (11) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this   Section 11.14  , to (A) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (B) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (11) to Gold Sheets and other similar bank trade publications, such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications, (11) with the consent of the Borrower or (11) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this   Section 11.14   or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Credit Party or any of their respective Affiliates on a non confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower not known to such Credit Party to be prohibited from disclosing such Information. 
  (b)        For purposes of this   Section 11.14  ,    Information    means all information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party on a non confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 
   
   The Borrower acknowledges that (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, (b) by virtue of the Loan Documents, none of the Administrative Agent or any Lender has any fiduciary relationship to the Borrower, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, is solely that of debtor and creditor, and (c) by virtue of the Loan Documents, no joint venture exists among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders. 
   
   The Borrower irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal Court sitting in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Loan Documents.  The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court, after all appropriate appeals, shall be conclusive and binding upon it. 
   
   The Borrower agrees that process may be served against it in any suit, action or proceeding referred to in   Section 11.16   by sending the same by first class mail, return receipt requested or by overnight courier service, with receipt acknowledged, to the address of the Borrower set forth in   Section 11.2  .  The Borrower agrees that any such service (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action, or proceeding, and (ii) shall to the fullest extent enforceable by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. 
   
   Nothing in the Loan Documents or any modification, waiver, or amendment thereto shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to serve process in any manner permitted by law or limit the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to bring proceedings against the Borrower in the courts of any jurisdiction or jurisdictions. 
   
   EACH OF THE CREDIT PARTIES AND THE BORROWER KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.  FURTHER, THE BORROWER HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF ANY OF THE CREDIT PARTIES, OR COUNSEL TO ANY OF THE CREDIT PARTIES, HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT ANY OF THE CREDIT PARTIES WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION.  THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE CREDIT PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,   INTER ALIA  , THE PROVISIONS OF THIS   SECTION 11.19  . 
   
   Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107 56 (signed into law October 26, 2001), as amended from time to time) (the    Patriot Act   ), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. 
   
   The Borrower agrees that in connection with all aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Credit Parties and the Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner named on the cover page hereof, and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of the Credit Parties and such     Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, or their respective Affiliates, and no such duty will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications. 
   
           11.22

     Solely to the extent the Administrative Agent or any Lender is an EEA Financial Institution and is a party to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: 
  (a)        the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by the Administrative Agent or any Lender that is an EEA Financial Institution; and

ARTICLE IV    DEFERRALS   COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS 
   
            (a) 
    Subject to the following provisions of this Article IV, an Eligible Executive may defer for any Plan Year, (i) up to fifty percent (50%) of Base Salary otherwise earned and payable in that Plan Year, and/or (ii) up to one hundred percent (100%) of Annual Cash Incentive otherwise earned in that Plan Year and payable in that Plan Year or in the first calendar quarter of the following Plan Year, and/or (iii) up to one hundred percent (100%) of Commissions otherwise earned in that Plan Year and payable in that Plan Year or in the first calendar quarter of the following Plan Year. The Plan Administrator may, as it deems appropriate, establish maximum or minimum limits on the amounts which may be deferred for a Plan Year and/or the times of such Deferred Compensation Elections.  An Eligible Executive shall be given advance notice of any such limits. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, a previously submitted Participant s Deferred Compensation Election (with respect to Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive and/or Commissions) shall be disregarded following the Participant s Termination of Employment. 
              (b) 
    Deferrals under the Plan shall be calculated with respect to the gross cash compensation payable to the Participant prior to any deductions (e.g., 401(k) deferrals) or withholdings. However, the Deferrals shall be reduced by the Plan Administrator as necessary if it is later determined, after Deferrals are made under the Plan and after additional deduction of all required income and employment taxes, 401(k) and other employee benefit deductions, and other deductions required by law, that all such total deferrals will exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the cash compensation of the Participant available under Section 4.1(a). Changes to payroll withholdings that affect the amount of compensation being deferred to the Plan shall be allowed only to the extent permissible under Section 409A of the Code. 
      
           4.2 
    Filing Requirements of Deferred Compensation Elections. 
     Subject to the following provisions of this Section, during an annual enrollment period established by the Plan Administrator in any Plan Year, an Eligible Executive described in Section 3.1 may elect, subject to Section 4.1 above, to defer a portion of his or her Base Salary that is otherwise earned and payable in the next Plan Year and/or all or a portion of his or her Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions otherwise earned in the next Plan Year and payable in that Plan Year or in the first calendar quarter of the subsequent Plan Year by submitting a Deferred Compensation Election during such annual enrollment period.  If an Executive becomes an Eligible Executive after October 1 (or such later date as prescribed by the Plan Administrator) in any calendar year, he or she may not make a Deferred Compensation Election for Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions earned in the next Plan Year. 
  A Participant shall submit a Deferred Compensation Election in the manner specified by the Plan Administrator and a Deferred Compensation Election that is not timely filed shall be considered void and have no effect. If a Participant does not file a Deferred Compensation Election applicable to his or her Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions earned in a Plan Year on or before the close of the applicable annual enrollment period (or such later date prescribed by the Plan Administrator), the Participant shall be deemed to have elected not to make a Deferred Compensation Election for such Plan Year. The Plan Administrator shall establish procedures that govern deferral elections under the Plan, including the ability to make separate elections for Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions, and any other cash remuneration payable to the Participant that the Committee or Plan Administrator permits a Participant to defer under the Plan. 
  Subject to the provisions of this Article, an Eligible Executive must file a new Deferred Compensation Election for each Plan Year that the Eligible Executive is eligible to participate in the Plan if the Eligible Executive intends to make a deferral under the Plan for such Plan Year.

4.3 
    Modification or Revocation of Election by Participant. 
              (a) 
    A Participant s Deferred Compensation Election for a Plan Year shall become irrevocable as of the close of business on the date established by the Plan Administrator, but not later than the last day of the calendar year preceding the Plan Year in which such Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions applicable to that election is earned, and shall become effective as of the first day of the Plan Year in which such Base Salary and/or Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions is earned. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator may cancel a Participant s Deferred Compensation Elections for the balance of a Plan Year if the Participant submits evidence of an unforeseeable emergency (as defined in the Universal 409A Definition Document) to the Plan Administrator. Any Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive, Commissions or other cash remuneration which would have been deferred pursuant to that cancelled Deferred Compensation Election shall be paid to the Eligible Executive as if he or she had not made that election. 
  A Participant may revoke or change a Deferred Compensation Election any time prior to the date such election becomes irrevocable. Any such change or revocation shall be made in a form and manner determined by the Plan Administrator. Under no circumstances may a Participant s Deferred Compensation Election be made, modified or revoked retroactively. 
           (b) 
    If a Participant s Deferred Compensation Election applicable to his or her Base Salary and/or Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions is cancelled for a Plan Year, he or she will not be permitted to elect to make Deferrals again until the next Plan Year. 
              (c) 
    If a Participant ceases to be an Executive after the date a Deferred Compensation Election becomes effective but continues to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate, he or she shall continue to be a Participant and his or her Deferred Compensation Election currently in effect shall remain in force, but such Participant shall not be eligible to make any further Deferred Compensation Elections until such time as he or she shall once again become an Eligible Executive. 
              (d) 
    Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if  an Eligible Executive: 
              i. 
    receives a withdrawal of deferred cash contributions on account of hardship from any plan which is maintained by the Company or an Affiliate and which meets the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code (or any successor thereto); and 
              ii. 
    is precluded from making contributions to such 401(k) plan for at least six (6) months after receipt of the hardship withdrawal, 
     the Eligible Executive s Deferred Compensation Election with respect to Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions in effect at that time shall be cancelled. Any Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions payment which would have been deferred pursuant to that Deferred Compensation Election but for the application of this Section 4.3(d) shall be paid to the Eligible Executive as if he or she had not made that election. 
   
           4.4 
    Company Contributions and Other Deferrals. 
              (a) 
    Company Contributions - Restoration of Lost Matching Contribution  . The amount of Lost Matching Contributions credited under the Plan on a Participant s behalf each calendar year shall be equal to (i) minus (ii) where: 
              i. 
    is the total Qualified Future Fund Matching Contribution that would have been allocated on the Participant s behalf under Future Fund, without giving effect to any  
     
   Page | 9  

reductions or limitations required by Sections 401(a)(17), 401(k), 402(g) and/or 415 of the Code, for the Plan Year based on the aggregate of the Participant s Elective Deferrals to Future Fund, his or her deferrals to any other qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or an Affiliate, and his or her Deferral under Section 4.1 for the Plan Year, disregarding, in all cases, any deferrals made with respect to Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentives and Commissions otherwise payable prior to the first payroll period commencing in the month following date the Participant s completion of one (1) Year of Service; and 
           ii. 
    If the Participant is eligible to contribute to Future Fund (whether pre-tax or after-tax) during the Plan Year, the actual matching contributions made on the Participant s behalf to Future Fund or any other qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or any Affiliate for that Plan Year.  
     In addition, if the Participant is not eligible to contribute to Future Fund during the Plan Year but is eligible to contribute to another qualified defined contribution plan (whether pre-tax or after-tax) maintained by the Company or an Affiliate during that Plan Year, the amount under this clause (ii) shall equal, unless otherwise provided by the  Committee, the maximum amount of matching contributions the Participant would have received under the provisions of Future Fund for that Plan Year had he or she been eligible to contribute to Future Fund during that Plan Year, based on his or her Base Salary and/or Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions otherwise earned and payable in that Plan Year, and his or her contributions to such other qualified defined contribution plan for that Plan Year had been made to Future Fund. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining the Lost Matching Contributions to be credited under this Section 4.4(a), Years of Service with respect to a Participant employed by Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, the limited liability corporation formed pursuant to the Framework Agreement between CVS Pharmacy, Inc. and Cardinal Health 110 Inc., dated December 10, 2013 ( Cardinal ), who immediately prior to becoming employed by Red Oak Sourcing, LLC was employed by Cardinal, shall include the period of such Participant s employment rendered with Cardinal. 
  Lost Matching Contributions shall be credited under this Section 4.4(a) with     respect to a Participant who made a Bonus Deferral Contribution election under the Omnicare, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan with respect to the 2016 Plan Year but such Lost Matching Contributions shall be subject to the Participant s distribution election and the distribution provisions of the Omnicare, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan in effect on the date of such Participant s election. 
  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, a Participant shall not be eligible to receive a Lost Matching Contribution following the Participant s Termination of Employment. 
  (b)      LTIP Deferrals  . 
  At the sole discretion of the Committee, all or a portion of a Participant s cash award under the LTIP may be deferred under the Plan. Such election shall be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Plan Administrator. The deferral election applicable to an LTIP cash award shall be made prior to the close of the calendar year preceding the first day of the performance period applicable to that award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such election shall become irrevocable as of the close of business of the last day of the calendar year preceding the first day of the performance period applicable to that award. However, if such award meets the definition of performance-based compensation (as defined under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(e) and any subsequent guidance), the Plan Administrator may permit such election to be made in accordance with the provisions under Treas. Reg.  
  
   Page | 10  

Section 1.409A-2(a)(8) and subsequent guidance. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, a previously submitted deferral election of a Participant s cash award under the LTIP shall be disregarded following the Participant s Termination of Employment. 
    (c)      Cash Retention Award Deferrals. 
  At the sole discretion of the Committee and subject to the procedures established by the Plan Administrator, an Eligible Executive may elect to defer all or a portion of a cash retention award that may be otherwise paid under a cash retention program maintained by the Company or an Affiliate. The deferral election applicable to such cash retention award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(a)(5). Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, a previously submitted deferral election of a Participant s cash retention award shall be disregarded following the Participant s Termination of Employment. 
   
           4.5 
    Deferral and Contribution Timing. 
     Base Salary Deferrals will be credited to the Account of each Participant as of the date of the pay check from which the deferral was withheld.  A Participant whose employment terminates during a payroll period will cease deferral withholding effective as of the first day of the following payroll period. 
  Annual Cash Incentive Deferrals and Commission Deferrals will be credited to the Account of each Participant as of the day on which such Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions, whichever is applicable, otherwise would have been paid to the Participant in cash. 
  Company Contributions for the Restoration of Lost Matching Contribution pursuant to Section 4.4(a) above will generally be credited to the Participant s Company Account as of the day on which said Lost Matching Contribution would otherwise have been credited to the Participant s account under Future Fund (generally following one Year of Participation Service). 
  LTIP deferrals shall be credited to the Account of the Participant at the time designated by the Plan Administrator. 
  Cash retention awards Deferrals will be credited to the Account of the Participant as of the day on which such cash retention award otherwise would have been paid to the Participant in cash.

ARTICLE V    ACCOUNTS 
   
           5.1 
    Establishment of Bookkeeping Accounts. 
     Separate bookkeeping accounts shall be maintained for each Participant. Said accounts (or subaccount(s) thereof) shall be credited with the deferrals and contributions made by or on behalf of the Participant pursuant to the Plan and credited (or charged, as the case may be) with the hypothetical investment results determined pursuant to this Article of the Plan. 
   
   Within each Participant s bookkeeping account, separate subaccount(s) shall be maintained to the extent necessary for the administration of the Plan. Generally, subaccount(s) will be set up for each year, for each Deferred Compensation Election the Participant makes, and for the Company Contribution credited each year on behalf of a Participant. 
   
           5.3 
    Hypothetical Nature of Accounts. 
     The accounts established under this Article shall be hypothetical in nature and shall be maintained for bookkeeping purposes only so that hypothetical gains or losses on the deferrals or contributions made to the Plan can be credited (or charged, as the case may be). 
  Neither the Plan nor any of the accounts, or subaccount(s), established hereunder shall hold any actual funds or assets. The right of any person to receive one or more payments under the Plan shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company. Any liability of the Company to any Participant, former Participant, or Beneficiary with respect to a right to payment shall be based solely upon contractual obligations created by the Plan. The Company, an Affiliate, the Board, the Committee, or any other person shall not be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship, between the Company, an Affiliate, the Board, the Committee, the Plan Administrator, or any other person and a Participant or any other person. 
   
   Deferral Account  . A Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested in his or her Deferral Account and Grandfathered Deferral Account at all times. A Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested in the LTIP deferrals credited on his or her behalf pursuant to Section 4.4(b) and any cash retention award deferrals credited on his or her behalf pursuant to Section 4.4(c). 
  Company Account  . A Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested in his or her Company Account and Grandfathered Company Account at all times. 
   
           5.5 
    Deferral Crediting Options. 
     Deferral Crediting Options are similar to investment choices in a qualified defined contribution plan, except that they are hypothetical in nature and no funds are actually held in the Plan. Deferral Crediting Options determine the hypothetical gain or loss to be reflected in the Participant Accounts and shall be elected by Participants in the manner determined by the Plan Administrator. 
  The Deferral Crediting Options offered to Participants are determined by the Plan Administrator at its sole discretion. The Plan Administrator specifically retains the right to change the Deferral Crediting Options at any time, in its sole discretion. 
  In the event the Plan Administrator designates more than one Deferral Crediting Option, each Participant shall electronically submit a Deferral Crediting Option election during each annual  
  
   Page | 12  

enrollment period, which shall be used to measure the hypothetical investment performance of his or her Accounts, within such time period and on such form as the Plan Administrator may prescribe. The designation of a Deferral Crediting Option shall not require the Company to invest or earmark their general assets in any manner. If a Participant fails to make a Deferral Crediting Option, his or her Accounts shall be deemed invested in a Deferral Crediting Option as determined by the Plan Administrator. 
  A Participant may change his or her election of a Deferral Crediting Option used to measure the hypothetical investment performance of his or her Account balance within such time periods and in such manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator. The election shall be effective as soon as administratively practicable after the date on which the election is submitted in the manner specified by the Plan Administrator. 
  Any amounts added to or subtracted from a Participant s Account on any given Valuation Date will be converted to hypothetical unit equivalents ( HypotheticalUnits ) with a value per Hypothetical Unit ( Unit Price ) based on the daily closing price on said date ( Unit Price ) for any given Deferral Crediting Option. 
   
           5.6 
    Hypothetical Gains or Losses. 
     Any hypothetical dividends, capital gains and any other income or unit activity will be reflected in the Deferral Crediting Options. The timing of these will be the same as for the funds on which each Deferral Crediting Option is based. 
  The gain or loss on Participant Accounts will be calculated each Valuation Date. The Unit Price shall determine each Deferral Crediting Option s hypothetical value, based on the number of units within the Account for any given Deferral Crediting Option. Account balances on a given day will be based on the previous day s New York Stock Exchange closing price.

ARTICLE VI    DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNT 
   
           6.1 
    Distribution Elections   Timing of Payment.

     A Participant may choose different options with respect to each Deferred Compensation Election. A Participant may not change the election made pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.1, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7 below.

The distribution of the portion of a Participant s Deferral or Company Account (or subaccount(s)) that is deferred to Retirement under this Section shall commence on the first business day in the January next following his or her Retirement, pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6, provided, however, that with respect to a Participant who is a Specified Employee as of the date of his or her Retirement, payment of any portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) that is subject to Section 409A of the Code will be delayed until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date such Retirement occurs. 
              ii.

The distribution of the portion of a Participant s Deferral or Company Account (or subaccount(s)) that is deferred to a Specific Future Year shall commence on the first business day of January in that specific year pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6. 
              (b) 
    Company Contributions shall be distributed pursuant to the Participant s distribution election. In the event a Participant has not made a distribution election for the Company Contributions for that Plan Year, such distribution shall mirror his or her distribution election made with respect to his or her Base Salary Deferral or Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions Deferral for that Plan Year, if any, in such order; otherwise, such distribution shall be made at the Participant s Retirement. 
      
           6.2 
    Disability Distributions. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant has a Termination of Employment because he or she has become Disabled, as determined by the Plan Administrator, such Participant will receive the balance of his or her Deferral Account and Company Account paid out in five (5) annual substantially equal installments with the first payment to be made within seventy-five (75) days from the date of the Participant s Termination of Employment.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Participant s death, the Participant s Beneficiary will receive the remaining balance of the Participant s Deferral Account and Company Account paid in two (2) annual installments with the first payment to be made within seventy-five (75) days of the  
  
   Page | 14  

Participant s date of death.  The second annual payment will be paid as of the first business day in January of the subsequent calendar year. 
   
           6.4 
    Distributions Upon Termination of Employment Other Than Retirement, Death or Disability.  
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment from the Company and all Affiliates for any reason other than Retirement, death or Disability, said Participant will receive his or her entire Deferral Account and Company Account balance in a single lump sum payment.  Such payment shall be made within seventy-five (75) days of the date  the Participant s Termination of Employment occurs; provided, however, that with respect to a Participant who is a Specified Employee as of the date of his or her Termination of Employment for reasons other than death, payment of any portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.4 will be delayed until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date such Termination of Employment occurs. 
   
   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VI, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, a Participant who has a valid change in control election(s) in effect shall automatically receive the balance of his or her Deferral Account and Company Account related to that election, in cash, in a single lump sum payment. Such lump sum payment shall be paid within forty-five (45) business days after the Change in Control occurs. If such Participant dies after such Change in Control event occurs, but before receiving such payment, it shall be made to his or her Beneficiary. 
   
            (a) 
    Installments  . Subject to the limitations set forth in Article VI,  distributions will be made in annual (or quarterly, if the election was made prior to October 1, 2008) installments, as elected by the Participant, for up to, and including, ten (10) years (fifteen (15) years for an election made prior to October 1, 2008). The initial installment of an annual or quarterly payment stream will begin as of the first business day of the January (a) next following the Participant s date of Retirement or (b) of the Specific Future Year, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of set forth in Section 6.1. Subsequent annual or quarterly payments will be as of the first business day of each subsequent calendar year or quarter of the installment period.  
     Each installment will be equal to a fraction of the Account balance (or subaccount(s) thereof) as of the date the installment is paid, with the numerator of the fraction being  1  and the denominator being the number of payments remaining in the payment schedule. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), if a Participant dies before receiving payment of the entire balance of his or her Deferral and Company Accounts under the provisions of this Section, the remaining value of such Accounts shall be payable to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.9. 
           (b) 
    Lump sum  . A Participant may elect distribution in the form of a single lump sum payment.  Except for Specified Employees, distribution shall be made as of the first business day of the January (a) next following the Participant s date of Retirement or (b) of the Specific Future Year, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of set forth in Section 6.1. 
              (c) 
    Distributions to a Participant made pursuant to Section 6.1 will occur pursuant to the Participant s payment elections at the time he or she submits the applicable Deferred Compensation Election.

   Page | 15  

Article V, shall be distributed pursuant to the Participant s form of payment election made with respect to his or her Company Contributions for that year. If the Participant has not made an election with respect to his or her Company Contributions, the portion of his or her Company Account attributable to such Company contributions will be distributed in accordance with his or her form of payment election with respect to his or her Base Salary Deferral, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions Deferrals for that year, if any, in that order; otherwise payment will be made in a lump sum payment. In the absence of an election of the form of payment by a Participant on a Deferred Compensation Election, the portion of the Participant s Account deferred pursuant to that Deferred Compensation Election, adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Article V, shall be paid in a single lump sum. 
           (d) 
    A Participant shall not change his or her form of payment election, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7 below. 
      
           6.7 
    Change of Distribution Election. 
              (a) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to change his or her Specific Future Year election under Section 6.1(a)(ii) with respect to a portion of his or her Deferral Account (or an Interim Distribution date election applicable to a portion of his or her Deferral Account or Company Account made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan as in effect prior to December 31, 2008) to a later Specific Future Year (or, if applicable, a later Interim Distribution date) by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new Specific Future Year election (or Interim Distribution date election) applicable to such Deferrals, subject to the following limitations: 
              i. 
    such election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the Specific Future Year (or Interim Distribution date) then in effect with respect to that portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or subaccount(s) thereof), and such election will not become effective until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made; and 
              ii. 
    the new Specific Future Year (or Interim Distribution date) shall be a calendar year that is not less than five (5) years from the Specific Future Year (or Interim Distribution date) then in effect. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may elect to delay his or her distribution from an elected Specific Future Year to the later of Retirement or a new Specific Future Year that is at least five (5) years from the Specific Future Year then in effect, provided the election is made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7(a). A Participant may elect to delay his or her distribution from an elected Specific Future Year (or Interim Distribution date) pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) more than once, provided that all such elections comply with the provisions of this Section 6.7(a). 
           (b) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to delay the payment of a portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) scheduled to be paid at his or her Retirement to his or her Retirement plus five (5) calendar years by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new Retirement election applicable to such deferrals; provided, however such election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to Retirement and shall not become effective until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made. 
              (c) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to change the form of payment election under Section 6.6 applicable to his or her  
     
   Page | 16  

distribution under Section 6.1(a)(i) or (ii) by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new form of payment election applicable to such deferrals, subject to the following limitations: 
           i. 
    such election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the Specific Future Year then in effect with respect to that portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or subaccount(s) thereof), and such election will not become effective until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made; and 
              ii. 
    the distribution of that portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or subaccount(s) thereof) shall be deferred for five (5) years from the date such amount would otherwise have been paid absent this election. 
              (d) 
    It is the Company's intent that the provisions of Sections 6.7(a), (b) and (c) comply with the subsequent election provisions in Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code, related regulations and other applicable guidance, and this Section 6.7 shall be interpreted accordingly. The Plan Administrator may impose additional restrictions or conditions on a Participant's ability to make an election pursuant to this Section 6.7. For avoidance of doubt, a Participant may not elect to alter the distribution of any portion of his or her Deferral or Company Accounts (or any subaccount(s) thereof) from Retirement to a Specific Future Year or, except as provided in paragraph (a) above, from a Specific Future Year to Retirement. 
      
           6.8 
    Account Valuation upon a Distribution. 
     With respect to a distribution made pursuant to this Article, the Valuation Date of a Participant s Account shall be the day immediately preceding the Distribution Date. 
   
           6.9 
    Designation of Beneficiary. 
     Each Participant shall have the right to designate a Beneficiary to receive payment of his or her Account in the event of death. Any such designation may be changed at any time by executing and submitting (either by hand or electronic submission) a new designation on a form prescribed by the Plan Administrator. 
   
   If the Plan Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary to whom an Account is payable, such Account may be forfeited to the Company upon the Plan Administrator s determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if subsequent to any such forfeiture, the Participant or Beneficiary to whom such Account is payable makes a valid claim, such forfeited Account shall be restored to the Plan and paid by the Company. 
   
   A Participant may apply in writing to the Plan Administrator for, and the Plan Administrator may grant, a hardship withdrawal of all or any part of a Participant s Deferral or Company Account if the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that the Participant has incurred an Unforeseeable Emergency, as defined in the Universal 409A Definition Document. 
  The Plan Administrator shall determine whether an event qualifies as a hardship within this Section, in its sole and absolute discretion. Such request shall be made in a time and manner determined by the Plan Administrator. The payment made from a Participant s Deferral or Company Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall not be in excess of the amount necessary to meet such financial hardship of the Participant, including amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or local income taxes with respect to the payment and shall not be available unless all other financial resources of the Participant have been exhausted. Payment  
  
   Page | 17  

shall be made in the month following the date the Plan Administrator determines that the Participant has incurred an unforeseeable severe financial hardship and grants the right to a withdrawal pursuant to this Section 6.11. 
   
           6.12 
    Distribution of Grandfathered Deferral Account and the Grandfathered Company Account. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VI, the distribution from a Participant s Grandfathered Deferral Account and Grandfathered Company Account (or subaccount(s)) shall be made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan as set forth on October 3, 2004, without regard to any amendments after October 3, 2004 which would constitute a material modification for Section 409A of the Code, as modified in Appendix A attached hereto. 

ARTICLE VII     ADMINISTRATION 
   
   The Plan shall be administered by the Deferred Compensation Plans Committee, appointed by the Committee as Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall be responsible for the general operation and administration of the Plan and for carrying out the provisions thereof. The Plan Administrator may delegate to others certain aspects of the management and operations of the Plan including the employment of advisors and the delegation of ministerial duties to qualified individuals, provided that such delegation is in writing. 
   
           7.2 
    General Powers of Administration. 
     The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive responsibility and complete discretionary authority to control the operation, management and administration of the Plan, with all powers necessary to enable it properly to carry out such responsibilities, including, but not limited to, the power to interpret the Plan and any related documents, to establish procedures for making any elections called for under the Plan, to make factual determinations regarding any and all matters arising hereunder, including, but not limited to, the right to determine eligibility for benefits, the right to construe the terms of the Plan, the right to remedy possible  ambiguities, inequities, inconsistencies or omissions, and the right to resolve all interpretive, equitable or other questions arising under the Plan. The decisions of the Plan Administrator or such other party as is authorized under the terms of any grantor trust on all matters shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons to the extent permitted by law. The Plan Administrator shall have all powers necessary or appropriate to enable it to carry out its administrative duties.

The notice of extension will provide the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make a decision. 
  If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant in writing of the following: 
           (a) 
    The reason or reasons for such denial; 
              (b) 
    The pertinent provisions of the Plan;

ARTICLE IX    MISCELLANEOUS 
   
           9.1 
    Not Contract of Employment. 
     The adoption and maintenance of the Plan shall not be deemed to be a contract between the Company or an Affiliate and any person and shall not be consideration for the employment of any person. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate or to restrict the right of the Company or an Affiliate to discharge any person at any time nor shall the Plan be deemed to give the Company or an Affiliate the right to require any person to remain in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate or to restrict any person s right to terminate his or her employment at any time. 
   
           9.2 
    Non-Assignability of Benefits. 
     No Participant, Beneficiary or distributees of benefits under the Plan shall have any power or right to transfer, assign, anticipate, hypothecate or otherwise encumber any part or all of the amounts payable hereunder, which are expressly declared to be unassignable and nontransferable. Any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void. No amount payable hereunder shall, prior to actual payment thereof, be subject to seizure by any creditor of any such Participant, Beneficiary or other distributees for the payment of any debt judgment or other obligation, by a proceeding at law or in equity, nor transferable by operation of law in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency or death of such Participant, Beneficiary or other distributee hereunder. 
   
           9.3 
    Withholding and Deduction and Taxes.  
     All deferrals and payments provided for hereunder shall be subject to applicable withholding and other deductions as shall be required of the Company under any applicable local, state or federal law. The Company may require that the Participant or Beneficiary making a deferral or receiving payments pay to the Company the amount of any federal, state or local taxes, if any, that the Company or any Affiliate is required to withhold with respect to such deferrals or payments or the Company or any Affiliate may deduct from other wages paid by the Company or any Affiliate the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such deferrals or payments.  A Participant or Beneficiary shall be solely responsible for any tax consequences related to deferrals or payments made under the Plan.  The Company shall have no obligation to make any payment under the Plan until the Company s or any Affiliate s tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant or Beneficiary.  
   
           9.4 
    Amendment and Termination. 
     The Committee or its delegate may from time to time, in its discretion, amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan; provided, however, that no amendment may be made that would impair the rights of a Participant with respect to amounts already allocated to his or her Account without the Participant s consent. To the extent consistent with the rules relating to plan terminations and liquidations in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) or otherwise consistent with Section 409A of the Code, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may terminate the Plan and any related Deferred Compensation Election at any time and in that event the Committee may provide that, without the prior written consent of Participants, the Participants  Accounts shall be distributed in a single cash lump sum upon termination of the Plan. Unless so distributed in accordance with the preceding sentence, in the event of a Plan termination, the Plan Administrator shall continue to maintain the Participants  Accounts until distributed pursuant to the terms of the Plan and Participants shall remain one hundred percent (100%) vested in all amounts credited to their Accounts. In the event of a Plan termination, the distribution of a Participant s Grandfathered Deferral Account and Grandfathered Company Account shall be made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan as set forth on October 3, 2004, without regard to any amendments after October 3, 2004 which would constitute a material modification for Section 409A of the Code, as modified in Appendix A attached hereto.

9.5 
    Compliance with Securities and Other Laws. 
     Notwithstanding any Plan provision to the contrary, the Committee may at any time impose such restrictions on the Plan and participation therein, including limiting the amount of any deferral or the timing thereof, as the Committee may deem advisable from time to time in order to comply or preserve compliance with any applicable laws, including any applicable state and federal securities laws and exemptions from registration available thereunder. 
   
   Nothing contained in the Plan and no action taken pursuant to its provisions by the Company or any person, shall create, nor be construed to create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant, Beneficiary, or any other person. 
   
           9.7 
    Unsecured General Creditor Status of Employee. 
     The payments to the Participant, Beneficiary or any other distributees hereunder shall be made from assets which shall continue, for all purposes, to be a part of the general, unrestricted assets of the Company. No person shall have or acquire any interest in any such assets by virtue of the provisions of the Plan. The Company s obligation hereunder shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future. To the extent that the Participant, Beneficiary or other distributees acquire a right to receive payments from the Company under the provisions hereof, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. No such person shall have or acquire any legal or equitable right, interest or claim in or to any property or assets of the Company. 
  In the event that, in its discretion, the Company purchases an insurance policy, or policies, insuring the life of the Employee, or any other property, to allow the Company to recover the cost of providing the benefits, in whole, or in part, hereunder, neither the Participant, Beneficiary or other distributee shall have or acquire any rights whatsoever therein or in the proceeds therefrom. The Company shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of any such policy or policies and, as such, shall possess and, may exercise all incidents of ownership therein. No such policy, policies or other property shall be held in any trust for a Participant, Beneficiary or other distributee or held as collateral security for any obligation of the Company hereunder. An Employee s participation in the underwriting or other steps necessary to acquire such policy or policies may be required by the Company and, if required, shall not be a suggestion of any beneficial interest in such policy or policies to a Participant. 
   
   A Participant and his or her Beneficiary shall assume all risk in connection with any decrease in value of his or her Account, and neither the     Company nor the Committee or the Plan Administrator shall be liable or responsible therefor. 
   
           9.9 
    Payment to Minors and Incompetents. 
     If any Participant, spouse, or Beneficiary entitled to receive any benefits hereunder is a minor or is deemed by the Plan Administrator or is adjudicated to be legally incapable of giving a valid receipt and discharge for such benefits, the benefits will be paid to the person or entity as the Plan Administrator determines has been appointed or established to receive such payment on behalf of such person. Such payment shall, to the extent made, be deemed a complete discharge of any payment obligation under the Plan. 
   
           9.10 
    Acceleration of or Delay in Payments. 
     The Plan Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, may elect to accelerate the time or form of payment of a benefit owed to the Participant hereunder, provided such acceleration is permitted under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4) and any subsequent guidance. The Plan Administrator  
  
   Page | 21  

may also, in its sole and absolute discretion, delay the time for payment of a benefit owed to the Participant hereunder, to the extent permitted under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A- 2(b)(7) and any subsequent guidance. 
   
   If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof; instead, each provision shall be fully severable and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein. 
   
   All provisions of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Rhode Island, except to the extent preempted by federal law. 
   
   The terms of the Plan shall be binding on each Participant and his or her heirs and legal representatives and on the Company and its successors and assigns.

 EXHIBIT 10.22

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.22 

2016 Management Incentive Plan 
    
  I.      Objectives and Summary 
  CVS Health Corporation s Management Incentive Plan (the  MIP ) is designed to reward incentive-eligible employees ( Eligible Participants ) of CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries (together,  the Company ) for their role in driving performance and to encourage Eligible Participants  continued employment with the Company.  Funding for the payment of incentive awards will be based on actual results measured against pre-established financial goals.  The amount of each incentive award paid will be based on the performance of the Company and the performance of the individual Eligible Participant. 
    
  The MIP shall be administered by the Management Planning and Development Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) under the provisions herein and of the 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  ICP ), and the Committee may delegate to officers of CVS Health the authority to perform administrative functions of the MIP as the Committee may determine and may appoint officers and others to assist it in administering the MIP. 
  II.      Plan Year 
  The MIP is a calendar year plan, which runs from January 1 to December 31, 2016 ( Plan Year ).  All dates in this document occur during the Plan Year unless otherwise stated. 
    
  III.      Eligibility 
  A.    Eligibility for Participation 
  The Chief Executive Officer of CVS Health Corporation ( CEO ) will determine those employees who are eligible for participation in the MIP, provided that the Committee shall determine the eligibility of employees who are or may be subject to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code  (collectively,  Section 162(m) Eligible Participants , whom will also be included in the term  Eligible Participants  unless otherwise noted).  In general, Eligible Participants include exempt employees who are not covered by any other incentive plans (including the Executive Incentive Plan) and who are employed on or before November 1 of the Plan Year; provided, however, that an employee who becomes a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant after January 1 of the Plan Year shall be eligible for an award under the MIP only to the extent that such award does not violate the requirements of Section 162(m). 
    
  The CEO (or, as to Section 162(m) Eligible Participants, the Committee) may, for any reason and in his or her (or its) sole discretion, at any time prior to the end of the Plan Year, determine an employee s eligibility for participation in the MIP.  Eligible Participants are subject to the terms and conditions relating to incentive awards set forth in the MIP. 
    
  B.    Section 162(m) Eligible Participants 
  Section 162(m) Eligible Participants shall be subject to the limitations required to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m).  Subject to the requirements of Section 162(m), the Committee shall retain sole discretion to determine a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant s eligibility for an award, the target award, and the amount of the actual award.  In no event shall a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant s award exceed the amount permitted by Section 162(m). 
    
  C.    Newly-Eligible Employees 
  The award, if any, to an Eligible Participant who became an Eligible Participant after the beginning of the Plan Year may be prorated based on the date of eligibility. 

D.    Position Change 
  An employee who becomes an Eligible Participant on or before November 1 of the Plan Year as a result of a position change may be eligible for a prorated MIP award.  If a position change results in an employee becoming an Eligible Participant for part of the Plan Year and other incentives during other parts of the Plan Year, the employee may be eligible to receive a prorated award for the amount of time in each incentive eligible position, subject to the terms of  
  
   2016 Management Incentive Plan    1            Confidential   Proprietary 

each applicable incentive plan.  A position change from one MIP-eligible position to another MIP-eligible postion during the Plan Year does not result in a prorata award but rather an award funded on the base salary of the Eligible Participant on December 31 of the Plan Year and the individual award opportunity as of that date. 
    
    E.    Demotions 
  If a previously Eligible Participant is demoted to a non-incentive eligible position due to his or her violation of CVS Health policy or his or her performance, or if he or she voluntarily transfers to a non-incentive eligible position during the Plan Year, and is in the non-incentive eligible position on the last day of the Plan Year, he or she will not be eligible to earn an incentive award for the Plan Year under the MIP. 
    
  F.    Terminations 
  Unless otherwise stated in Section VII of the MIP, if an Eligible Participant s employment terminates prior to the final determination of incentive awards for the Plan Year, he or she will not be eligible to receive an incentive award under the MIP.  The final determination of incentive awards generally occurs in February of the year following the Plan Year. 
    
  G.    Rehires 
  Employees who are rehired as Eligible Participants on or before November 1 of the Plan Year may be eligible for a prorated incentive award.  For purposes of proration, credit will only be given for time worked during the Plan Year in incentive-eligible positions. 
    
  IV.      Target Measurements and Total Pool 
  A.    Consolidated Company Funding 
  MIP funding is based on consolidated Company performance, measured by Operating Profit, Pharmacy Benefit Management ( PBM ) Client Satisfaction, and Retail Customer Service as defined below.  Achievement of the Company s Operating Profit target will determine 80% of the total funding (the  Total Pool  achievement of PBM Client Satisfaction targets will determine 10% of the Total Pool; and achievement of the Retail Customer Service target, as measured by  myCustomer Experience  scores, will determine the remaining 10% of the Total Pool. 
    
  1.      Operating Profit 
  Operating Profit is determined by reference to EBIT (see Exhibit A) and may be adjusted by the financial adjustments as approved by the Committee prior to the end of the first fiscal quarter of the Plan Year (the  Financial Adjustments ). 
    
  If Operating Profit is below the minimum threshhold of 96.9% (see Exhibit B), no formulaic funding will be made available for incentive awards, regardless of Retail Customer Service and PBM Client Satisfaction performance, and there shall be no  incentive awards paid under the MIP. 
    
  2.      PBM Client Satisfaction 
  Achievement of the PBM Client Satisfaction component of incentive funding will be determined by the aggregate actual performance against target (see Exhibit B) of the weighted composite of the following surveys: 
             
    Client Relationship and Loyalty Survey (weight = 50%) 
                
    Mail Service Pharmacy and Customer Care Survey (weight = 25%) 
                
    Specialty Pharmacy Satisfaction Survey (weight = 25%) 
     PBM Client Satisfaction funding is subject to adjustment based on Operating Profit. 
  3.    Retail Customer Service 
  The Retail Customer Service component of the incentive funding will be determined using the myCustomer Experience actual performance against the target (see Exhibit B).  The myCustomer Experience score is derived based on Rx Score and Front Store score and assigned weightings. 
    
  Retail Customer Service funding is subject to adjustment based on Operating Profit.

  B.    Total Pool Funding 
  After the achievement of at least threshold for Operating Profit has been confirmed, performance of PBM Client Satisfaction and Retail Customer Service compared to target for the Plan Year will be calculated.  The Total Pool for all business units will be fully based (100%) on consolidated Company performance. 
  The CEO or, in the case of Section 162(m) Eligible Participants, the Committee may adjust  the funding of the Total Pool at his or her or its discretion based on (a) input from the PBM and Retail Presidents and Finance regarding their assessment of the overall performance of the Company; and (b)  assessment of the achievement of Plan Year performance goals.  In no case, however, can the CEO or the Committee increase Total Pool funding due to PBM Client Satisfaction or Retail Customer Service results. 
  C.    Individual Performance    
  The Total Pool will be available for award to Eligible Participants under the MIP, taking into account the individual contribution of each Eligible Participant.  The amount, if any, of the incentive award for an Eligible Participant shall be detemined in the sole discretion of the Company, which shall be final, binding and conclusive as to all parties having an interest therein.  The amount, if any, of the  incentive award for a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, which shall be final, binding and conclusive as to all parties having an interest therein. 
    
  V.      Earnings and Payout 
  A.    Timing 
  Incentive awards will be paid to Eligible Participants as soon as administratively feasible following the date the Total Pool is determined and approved and the amount of incentive payments is determined for each eligible participant, but in any case on or before March 15 of the year immediately following the Plan Year.  Incentive payments under the MIP may be subject to garnishments and other state or federal requirements. 
    
  B.    Calculations 
  Calculations for full and partial awards will be based on each Eligible Participant s annual base salary and individual target opportunity as of the last day of the Plan Year. 
    
  For purposes of proration under the MIP and except as otherwise provided in Section VII, calculations will be based on the number of days that the employee was an Eligible Participant in the MIP during the Plan Year. 
  C.    Award Opportunity 
  Individual target awards will be determined by position and may vary based on the Eligible Participant s level in the organization. 
    
  D.    Obligation to Pay Out Percentage of Total Pool 
  Eligible Participants, as a group, have a right to receive an amount at least equal to the Total Pool, but no individual Eligible Participant shall be entitled to receive an award or any specific amount of the Total Pool.  In no event will  
  
   2016 Management Incentive Plan    3            Confidential   Proprietary 

the aggregate of the total awards paid from the MIP be less than 92.5% of the Total Pool.  To discourage unmerited litigation, any party or class asserting a challenge or claim against the Company under any provision of the MIP, including this Section V, shall bear their own costs relating to such challenge or claim, and if the challenge or claim is unsuccessful, such party or class shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable costs incurred by the Company in responding to such challenge or claim. 
    
  VI.      Corrections to Incentive Awards 
  Any requested corrections to incentive award calculations must be submitted through the Human Resources Business Partner to Compensation by April 15 of the year following the Plan Year. 
    
           VII. 
    Eligible Participant Status 
     A.    Performance 
  Subject to the requirements of Section 162(m), the Company has full discretion in determining the amount, if any, of a MIP award to an Eligible Participant, including Eligible Participants whose awards may be based on SGIs, and the Participant s individual performance throughout the Plan Year will be considered by the Company in the final determination of the Eligible Participant s incentive award. 
    
  B.    Leaves of Absence 
  An Eligible Participant on a Company-approved leave of absence at any time during the Plan Year who remains employed in an eligible position as of the last day of the Plan Year will earn a prorated incentive award based on the number of days actively worked (including time compensated as vacation, myTime or Paid Time Off ( PTO )) during the Plan Year, provided he or she meets all other eligibility criteria for an incentive award. 
  C.    Reduction in Force, Retirement and Death 
  1.    Reduction in Force 
  If an Eligible Participant is separated from employment by the Company on or before the last day of the Plan Year due to a reduction in force, he or she may be eligible, at the Company s discretion, to receive a prorated incentive award based on the incentive targets in place immediately before the separation date, provided the Eligible Participant meets all other eligibility criteria for an incentive award. 
  2.    Retirement    
  If an Eligible Participant is at least age 55 and has a minimum of 10 years of service with CVS Health or a predecessor company/subsidiary   or   is at least age 60 and has a minimum of 5 years of service with CVS Health or a predecessor company/subsidiary   and   the Eligible Participant retires before the end of the Plan Year, he/she may be eligible to receive a prorated incentive award based on the incentive targets in place immediately before the termination date, provided he/she meets all other eligibility criteria for an incentive award.  Eligible Participants who do not meet the minimum retirement requirements under this section at the time of retirement and who retire before the end of the Plan Year will   not   be eligible for an incentive award. 
  3.    Death 
  In case of the death of an Eligible Participant, a prorated incentive award may be paid to the Eligible Participant s spouse, if living; otherwise, in equal shares to surviving children of the Eligible Participant.  If there are no surviving children, the benefit shall be paid to the Eligible Participant s estate.  The incentive award will be prorated based on the number of months the Eligible Participant worked during the Plan Year     and   incentive targets   in place   immediately before the   termination   date, and shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable following the death of the Eligible Participant but no later than March 15 of the year following the Plan Year.  For this purpose, if the death of an Eligible Participant occurs on or before the 15   th    of the month, the month will not be included in the proration calculations, and if the death occurs after the 15   th    of the month, the month will be included in the proration calculations. 
           VIII. 
    Miscellaneous 
       A.   No Promise of Continued Employment 
  The MIP does not create an express or implied contract of employment between CVS Heath and an Eligible Participant.  Both CVS Health and the Eligible Participant retain the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, at any time and for any reason. 
  
   2016 Management Incentive Plan    4            Confidential   Proprietary 

B.    Rights are Non-Assignable 
  Neither the Eligible Participant, nor any beneficiary, nor any other person shall have any right to assign, in whole or in part, the right to receive payments under the MIP.  Payments are non-assignable and non-transferable, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. 
  C.    Compliance with Applicable Law 
    An Eligible Participant must comply with all applicable state and federal law and CVS Health policies to be eligible to receive an incentive award under the MIP. 
  CVS Health will comply with all applicable laws concerning incentive awards; the MIP and its administration are not intended to conflict with any applicable state or federal law. 
  D.    Change in Control 
  In the event of a change in control of CVS Health, as defined in the ICP, the MIP shall remain in full force and effect.  Any amendments, modifications, termination or dissolution of the MIP by the acquiring entity may only occur prospectively and will not affect incentive targets or awards or eligibility in place immediately before the date of the change in control or such later date as it may be modified or dissolved by the acquiring entity. 
    
  Provisions regarding the payment of annual incentive awards that are set forth in change in control agreements with Eligible Employees shall supersede those appearing in the MIP. 
  E.    Withholding 
  All required deductions will be withheld from the incentive awards prior to distribution.  This includes all applicable federal, state, or local taxes, as well as any eligible 401(k) deductions and deferred compensation contributions as defined by the applicable plans.  Incentive awards that are deferred will be taxed according to applicable federal and state tax law.  Each Eligible Participant shall be solely responsible for any tax consequences of his or her award hereunder. 
  F.    MIP Amendment/Modification/Termination 
  CVS Health retains the right to amend, modify, or terminate the MIP at any time on or before the last day of the Plan Year for any reason, with or without notice to Eligible Participants, provided that no changes shall be made with respect to a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant that would not comply with the requirements of Section 162(m). 
  G.    MIP Interpretation 
  All inquiries with respect to the MIP and any requests for interpretation of any provision in the MIP must be submitted to the appropriate Human Resources Business Partner in writing.  Failure to submit a request for resolution of a dispute or question in writing within 30 days of distribution of the incentive award may result in a waiver of the Eligible Participant s rights to dispute the MIP provision or amount of the incentive award. 
  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such defined term(s) in the ICP.  In the event of any conflict between the ICP and the MIP, the terms of the ICP shall govern. 
  H.    Recoupment of Incentive Awards    
  Each incentive award under the MIP shall be subject to the terms of the Company s Recoupment Policy as it exists from time to time, which may require the Eligible Employee to immediately repay to the Company the value of any pre-tax economic benefit that he or she may derive from the MIP. 
    
  I.    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code 
  The Company intends that the MIP not violate any applicable provision of, or result in any additional tax or penalty under, Section 409A of the Code, as amended, and the regulations and guidance thereunder (collectively,  Section 409A ), and that to the extent any provisions of the Plan do not comply with Section 409A the Company will make such changes as it deems reasonable in order to comply with Section 409A.  Payments hereunder are intended to qualify as short-term deferral payments under Section 409A.  In all events, the provisions of CVS Health Corporation s Universal 409A Definition Document are hereby incorporated by reference, and notwithstanding the any other provision of the Plan or any Award to the contrary, to the extent required to avoid a violation of the applicable rules under Section 409A by reason of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (requiring certain delays for  specified employees ), payment of any amounts subject to Section 409A shall be delayed until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date of termination of employment.  For purposes of any provision of the Plan

Exhibit 10.23 
  
             2016 Executive Incentive Plan 

I.      Objectives and Summary 
  CVS Health Corporation s Executive Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) governs annual incentive awards for certain key executive officers of CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries (together,  the Company ).  The purpose of the Plan is to reward certain key executive officers of the Company for their material contributions to the Company and to motivate them to continue making such contributions in the future.  The Plan is intended to provide performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), and the provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted to effectuate such intent. 
    
  The Management Planning and Development Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) shall administer the Plan under the provisions herein and of the 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  ICP ) and shall have authority, without limitation, to determine the Participants (as defined in Section III), to determine the terms and conditions of any Award (as defined in Section III) and to interpret the Plan.  Subject to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, delegate to officers of CVS Health the authority to perform administrative functions of the Plan as the Committee may determine and may appoint officers and others to assist it in administering the Plan. 
  II.      Plan Year 
  The Plan is a calendar year plan, which runs from January 1 to December 31 ( Plan Year ). 
    
  III.      Eligible Participants 
  Within 90 days after the start of the applicable Plan Year, the Committee shall designate the key executives of the Company who are eligible to participate in the Plan for the Plan Year (each, a  Participant ) and to receive an award under the terms of the Plan (an  Award ).  The Participants for the Plan Year shall be set forth in the Exhibit A to the Plan related to the Plan Year ( Exhibit A ).  Except as the Committee may otherwise determine, it is intended that the Participants for any Plan Year shall include all employees who are treated as  covered employees  within the meaning of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code for that Plan Year and whose compensation for such Plan Year consequently may be subject to the limit on deductible compensation imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code.  The Committee may designate a key executive as a Participant after the first 90 days of the applicable Plan Year, but only if the key executive is a new employee of the Company. 
    
  IV.      Bonus Pool 
  A.  For each Plan Year, the Company will establish a pool of funds for that Plan Year in an amount equal to 0.5% of the Company s Adjusted Net Income for the Plan year (the  Bonus Pool ).  For purposes of the Plan,  Adjusted Net Income  is defined as adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health as reported by the Company in its year-end earnings.  Within 90 days of the start of the Plan Year, the Committee may make provision for excluding from the calculation of the Bonus Pool the effect of extraordinary events and changes in accounting methods, practices or policies. 
    
  B.  Within 90 days of the start of each Plan Year, the Committee will designate a percentage of the Bonus Pool to be allocated to each Participant and a percentage to be reserved in the event the Committee wishes to allocate a percentage to a new Participant, if any, after the first 90 days of the applicable Plan Year.  The allocations will be set forth in the Exhibit A for the Plan Year.  The maximum allocation that may  
  
   Executive Incentive Plan                    Confidential   Proprietary 

be made to any Participant for a Plan Year will be 40%, and in no event shall the allocations, in the aggregate, exceed 100% of the Bonus Pool.  Regardless of the foregoing, in no event shall any Participant be entitled to receive more than his or her individual cap as set forth in Exhibit A for the Plan Year. 
    
  V.        Awards    
  A.      Following the completion of each Plan Year, the Committee shall certify in writing the amount of the Bonus Pool and the actual Award amount, if any, payable to each Participant for such Plan Year.   Subject to Section V.B, the actual Award amount payable to a Participant shall equal his or her allocable percentage of the Bonus Pool as certified by the Committee. 
    
  B.      The Committee in its sole and exclusive discretion may reduce (including a reduction to zero) the Award to a Participant otherwise payable under the Plan for the Plan Year at any time prior to the payment of the Award to the Participant.  The exercise of such negative discretion with respect to one Participant shall not result in an increase in the amount payable to any other Participant.   
    
           VI.   
    Payment of Awards 
     A.  Subject to Section V, a Participant shall receive payment of an Award if he or she remains employed by the Company through the final determination of incentive awards for the Plan Year; provided, however, that no Participant shall be entitled to payment of an Award hereunder until the Committee makes the certification provided for in Section V. The final determination of incentive awards generally occurs in February of the year following the Plan Year. 
    
  B.  Awards shall be paid in cash or in any other form prescribed by the Committee and shall be paid to Participants as soon as administratively feasible following the date that annual bonuses are determined and approved for Company employees generally, but in any case on or before March 15 of the year immediately following the Plan Year.  Awards may be subject to garnishments and other state or federal tax withholding requirements. 
    
  C.          Calculations for full and partial awards will be based on each Participant s annual base salary and individual target opportunity as of December 31st of the Plan Year. For purposes of proration, the 15   th    of the month will be used to determine if the month is included or excluded from the incentive calculation, as follows: 
           1. 
    If a Participant s employment is terminated on or before the 15   th    of the month and the employee is eligible for a prorated award under the Plan, then the full month will be excluded from incentive calculations. 
              2. 
    If a Participant s employment is terminated after the 15   th    of the month and the employee is eligible for a prorated award under the Plan, then the full month will be included in the incentive calculations.  
       
  VII.          Retirement and Death     
  A.  If a Participant is at least age 55 and has a minimum of 10 years of service with the Company   or   is at least age 60 and has a minimum of 5 years of service with the Company   and   the Participant retires before the end of the Plan Year, he/she may be eligible to receive a prorated Award based on the number of months worked during the Plan Year, provided he/she meets all other eligibility criteria for an Award.    Participants who do not meet the minimum retirement requirements under this section at the time of retirement and who retire before the end of the Plan Year will   not   be eligible for an Award. 
    
  B.  In the case of the death of a Participant before the end of the Plan Year, a prorated Award may be paid to the  Participant s spouse, if living; otherwise, a prorated Award may be paid in equal shares to  
  
   Executive Incentive Plan    2            Confidential   Proprietary 

surviving children of the Participant.  If there are no surviving children, a prorated Award may be paid to the Participant s estate.  If an Award is paid, the Award will be prorated based on the number of months the Participant worked during the Plan Year.  
    
  VIII.     Miscellaneous 
           A.  
    No Promise of Continued Employment 
     The Plan does not create an express or implied contract of employment between the Company and a Participant.  Both the Company and the Participant retain the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, at any time and for any reason. 
  B.        Rights are Non-Assignable 
  Neither the Participant, nor any beneficiary, nor any other person shall have any right to assign, in whole or in part, the right to receive payments under the Plan.  Payments are non-assignable and non-transferable, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. 
    
           C.   
    Compliance with Applicable Law 
       A Participant must comply with all applicable state and federal law and the policies of the Company to be eligible to receive an Award under the Plan. 
    
  The Company will comply with all applicable laws concerning incentive awards; the Plan and its administration are not intended to conflict with any applicable state or federal law.   
  D.        Change in Control 
  In the event of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the ICP, the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.  Any amendments, modifications, termination or dissolution of the Plan by the acquiring entity may only occur prospectively and will not affect incentive earnings or eligibility before the date of the change in control or such date as it may be modified or dissolved by the acquiring entity.   
    
  Provisions regarding the payment of annual incentive awards that are set forth in change in control agreements with Participants shall supersede those appearing in the Plan. 
  E.        Withholding 
  All required deductions will be withheld from the Awards prior to distribution. This includes all applicable federal, state, or local taxes, as well as any eligible 401(k) deductions and deferred compensation contributions as defined by the applicable plans.  Awards that are deferred will be taxed according to applicable federal and state tax law. Each Participant shall be solely responsible for any tax consequences of his or her Award hereunder. 
    
  F.        Amendment/Modification/Termination 
  The Company retains the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time on or before the last day of the Plan Year for any reason, with or without notice to Participants, provided that no changes shall be made that would not comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. 
    
           G.   
    Interpretation 
     All inquiries with respect to the Plan and any requests for interpretation of any provision in the Plan must be submitted to the Committee in writing.

  I.        Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code

  (B)    Manner of Exercise of Committee Authority  .    The express grant of any specific power to the Committee, and the taking of any action by the Committee, shall not be construed as limiting any power or authority of the Committee.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may delegate to officers or managers of the Company or any subsidiary, or committees thereof, the authority, subject to such terms as the Committee shall determine, to perform such functions, including administrative functions, as the Committee may determine.  The Committee may appoint agents to assist it in administering the PEP.

The Committee and each member thereof shall be entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to him or her by any Participant officer, other officer or employee of the Corporation or a subsidiary, the Company s independent auditors, consultants or any other agents assisting in the administration of the PEP. Members of the Committee and any officer or employee of the Company or a subsidiary acting at the direction or on behalf of the Committee shall not be personally liable for any action or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to the PEP, and shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company with respect to any such action or determination. 
    
  V.    Award.       Upon approval by the Committee, an Eligible Participant shall be notified that he or she has been selected to receive an Award, contingent upon the Eligible Participant s decision to invest in the PEP by completion of a PEP participant election form (an    Election Form   ).  The Award will stipulate the Grant Date and the amount the Eligible Participant may invest in the PEP.

Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Company Matching Options will vest as to one-third of the underlying shares of Stock on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Grant Date; provided, however, that the vesting of said Company Matching Option may be accelerated in accordance with the provisions of the PEP Section XIII(D).

An exercise shall be accomplished in accordance with Section 6(b) of the 2010 ICP.  At the time of exercise, the exercise price of the number of shares as to which the Company Matching Option is being exercised shall be tendered to the Company.  The exercise price of such Company Matching Option shall be paid in cash or by check or by surrender to the Company of shares of Stock (valued at their FMV as of the date of exercise) already owned by the Participant, other than shares acquired from the Company by exercise of an option during the preceding six months, or by a combination of cash, check, and surrender of such shares.

Except as provided below in this Section XIII, if, for any reason, a Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates prior to the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date, all Company Matching RSUs not yet vested and all Company Matching Options not yet exercised shall be immediately forfeited as of Participant s employment termination date. For purposes of this section,    Cause    shall have the same meaning as defined in the Company s standard change in control agreement. Participant s transfer of employment from the Company to a subsidiary of the Company, from a subsidiary of the Company to the Company or from one subsidiary of the Company to another subsidiary of the Company shall not be considered a termination of employment. 
           (A) 
    Involuntary Termination of Participant s Employment without Cause. 
     (i)   In the event that the Company terminates a Participant s employment with the Company and its subsidiaries and the Participant receives severance pay, the Participant s Award shall be treated as follows: 
  (a)   If Participant s employment with the Company and its subsidiaries terminates prior to the second (2   nd   ) anniversary of the Grant Date as a result of the Participant s voluntary termination of employment or involuntary termination by the Company or any subsidiary for Cause, the Participant Purchased RSUs shall be immediately forfeited as of the termination date.

Award agreement. All applicable taxes due at time of vesting shall be immediately paid by the Participant; 
  (c)   any Company Matching RSUs  not vested at the time of Participant s employment termination date but scheduled to vest during the severance period specified in the agreement providing for severance pay shall vest as of the Participant s employment termination date and settle in accordance with the regular schedule set forth in the applicable Award agreement. All applicable taxes due at time of vesting shall be immediately paid by the Participant;  
  (d)   any Company Matching Options not vested at the time of Participant s employment termination date but scheduled to vest during the severance period specified in the agreement providing for severance pay shall be exercisable at any time during the severance period and on or before the ninetieth (90   th   ) day following the last day of the severance period, as long as no government regulations or rules are violated by such continued vesting or exercise period; provided, however, that no Company Matching Option will be exercisable beyond its original term; and 
  (e)   any Company Matching RSUs and Company Matching Options not scheduled to vest during the specified severance period shall be forfeited as of the Participant s employment termination date.  
  (ii)    The Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to make any interpretations, determinations, and/or take any administrative actions with respect to whether any post-termination payments to the Participant shall be deemed severance pay, the duration of any severance period, and/or whether a termination was without Cause. 
           (B) 
    Retirement of Participant.       Qualified Retirement    shall mean termination of employment on or after attainment of age fifty-five (55) with at least ten (10) years of continuous service, or attainment of age sixty (60) with at least five (5) years of continuous service, provided that:  (i) if the Participant elects to terminate his or her employment voluntarily, the Participant has provided the Company with at least twelve (12) months advance notice of his or her retirement date  or such other term of advance notice as is determined by the Chief Human Resources Officer of the Company; or (ii) if the Company elects to terminate the Participant s employment, then such termination is without cause. As of the Participant s retirement date, any Participant Purchased Shares shall not be subject to any transfer or sale restrictions, and any Participant Purchased RSUs shall vest as of the Participant s retirement date and shall settle  in accordance with the regular schedule set forth in the applicable Award agreement. The Participant may exercise his or her vested Company Matching Option during the two-year period following the retirement date; any portion of the Company Matching Option which is not vested as of the retirement date shall be forfeited by the Participant as of the retirement date.  Any Company Matching RSU or Company Matching Option that is not vested as of the retirement date shall be forfeited by the Participant.  In the event the Participant s termination of employment qualifies as a Qualified Retirement and the Participant also enters into a severance agreement with the Company, the terms of Section XIII(A) shall apply with respect to the settlement of Participant Purchased RSUs and the vesting and settlement of Company Matching RSUs and Company Matching Options. 
              (C) 
    Disability of Participant.    In the event a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, by reason of total and permanent disability (as defined in the Company s Long-Term Disability Plan, or, if not defined in such plan, as defined by the Social Security Administration), any Participant Purchased Shares shall not be subject to any transfer or sale restrictions. In addition, any Participant Purchased RSUs and any Company Matching RSUs shall vest as of Participant s disability date and shall settle in accordance with the regular schedule set forth in the applicable Award agreement and any Company Matching Option shall vest and be exercisable during the twelve (12) month period following Participant s employment termination date, in each case on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Award in effect for the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall be deemed to have ceased employment due to a qualifying disability under this Section XIII (C) only if at the time of such cessation of employment the Participant is disabled within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code pursuant to the regulations thereunder. 
              (D) 
    Death of Participant.    In the event of a Participant s death while employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries, any Participant Purchased Shares shall not be subject to any transfer or sale restrictions.  In addition, all Participant Purchased RSUs and all Company Matching RSUs shall vest and settle on Participant s date of death and Company Matching Options shall become immediately vested in full.  The Company Matching Option may be exercised during the twelve (12) month period   

- 5 - 

following the Participant s date of death, or prior to the Company Matching Option expiration date, whichever occurs first, by the Participant s Beneficiary .  At the end of said one-year time period, all rights with respect to any Company Matching Option that is unexercised shall terminate and the unexercised Company Matching Option shall be cancelled. 
           (E) 
    Change In Control.    In the event of a Termination Without Cause or a Constructive Termination Without Cause, in each case within the two-year period following a Change in Control, any Participant Purchased Shares shall not be subject to any transfer or sale restrictions.  In addition, all of the Participant s outstanding Participant Purchased RSUs and all Company Matching RSUs shall vest and settle as of the Participant s termination date and Company Matching Options that are not then vested will become immediately vested and exercisable for the remainder of the term of the Company Matching Option but not beyond its original Expiration date provided in Section XII(D). All other terms and conditions governing such Company Matching RSUs, Participant Purchased RSUs and Company Matching Options will be subject to the provisions of the Company s 2010 ICP.  
              (F) 
    Coordination of Provisions.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, to the extent that the circumstances of the termination of a Participant s employment are within the description of more than one of the subparagraphs above in this Section XIII, each portion of a Participant s Company Matching RSU or Company Matching Option under any Award shall be entitled to the more favorable treatment explicitly applicable to such portion of the Participant s Company Matching RSU or Company Matching Option under the provisions of this Section XIII.  For example, if a Participant qualifies as Qualified Retiree at the time of the Participant s termination of employment but the Participant receives severance in connection with the Participant s termination as described in Section XIII (A), the Participant s unvested Matching Company Option shall continue to vest during the applicable severance period and any portion of the Company Matching Option that vests during the severance period shall be exercisable on or before the ninetieth (90   th   ) day following the last day of the severance period, while any portion of the Participant s Matching Company Option that is vested as of the Participant s termination may be exercised during the two-year period following the Retirement Date.  Similarly, by way of example, if a Participant experiences a termination of employment due to disability following a Change in Control, the treatment described in Section XIII (E) shall apply to the Participant s Awards to the extent that such treatment is more favorable to the Participant than the treatment applicable under Section XIII (C).  
              (G) 
    In any case, the settlement of Participant Purchased RSUs and Company Matching RSUs shall be subject to the settlement timing provisions of Section XIV(C)(ix) of the PEP. 
       
  XIV.         General Provisions. 
  (A)    Stock Dividends and Stock Splits  .  If the Company declares and pays a dividend or distribution in the form of Stock payable on Stock, or if there is a stock split of the Stock, and the record date is prior to the Settlement Date of Participant Purchased and/or Company Matching RSUs, the Company shall credit, as of the dividend payment date, distribution, or split, a number of additional Participant Purchased RSUs and Company Matching RSUs, as the case may be, to the Participant s account equal to the number of shares of Stock paid as a dividend or distribution per share of Stock or distributed as a result of the split per share of Stock multiplied by the number of Participant Purchased RSUs and Company Matching RSUs, as the case may be, credited to the Participant s account at the record date. 
  (B)    Treatment of Additional Participant Purchased RSUs and Company Matching RSUs Resulting from Dividends or Splits.    Additional Participant Purchased RSUs or Company Matching RSUs will be subject to the same terms, including the risk of forfeiture in the case of Company Matching RSUs, as the Participant Purchased RSUs or Company Matching RSUs in respect of which they were credited.  No such additional Company Matching RSUs will be credited to the Participant s account in respect of Company Matching RSUs forfeited on or before the payment date for the dividend, distribution, or split. 
    (C)        Other Terms  .  The following terms and provisions will be applicable to Participant Purchased Shares or RSUs, Company Matching RSUs and Company Matching Options, as applicable.

              (ii) 
    Nontransferability  .  Participant Purchased Shares or Participant Purchased RSUs, Company Matching RSUs, Company Matching Options, and all rights relating thereto, shall not be transferable or assignable by a Participant, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution (or pursuant to a beneficiary designation if and to the extent authorized by the Committee), and shall not be pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered in any  

- 6 - 

way or subject to execution, attachment, or similar process, and any such attempt to transfer such rights shall be considered null and void by the Company. 
           (iii) 
    Certain Other Terms  .  Additional terms applicable to Awards under the PEP are set forth in the 2010 ICP. 
              (iv) 
    No Partnership Rights or Rights to Participate  .  A Participant s participation in the PEP, investment in Participant Purchased Shares or Participant Purchased RSUs, and grant of an Award under the PEP confers no rights as a partner of a partnership.  No Participant has or will have any claim to participate in the PEP, except as selected by the Committee, and the Company will have no obligation to continue the PEP.  
              (v) 
    Changes to the PEP  .  The Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the PEP without the consent of any Participant; provided, however, that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such action shall materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant with respect to an outstanding Award. 
              (vi) 
    Limitation on Repurchase Obligation  .  All repurchases of Stock permitted to occur in the ordinary course pursuant to the terms established under the PEP are intended to qualify for the exemption from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act and, accordingly, such repurchases are authorized to occur with respect to all Awards under the PEP unless and until the repurchase rights and obligations relating to an Award are explicitly revoked by the Committee. 
              (vii) 
    Agreements and Other Documents  .  The Committee shall specify agreements or other documents to evidence rights and obligations under the PEP.

              (viii) 
    Governing Law  .  The validity, construction, and effect of the PEP, any rules and regulations and any award agreements or related documents hereunder shall be determined in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws and applicable federal law. 
              (ix) 
    Section 409A Compliance.    The Participant Purchased RSUs and Company Matching RSUs under the PEP are intended to qualify as nonqualified deferred compensation awards which comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the regulations thereunder. The vesting dates shall be the dates fixed under the terms of the PEP as of the Grant Date, subject to acceleration only upon the following permissible events under Section 409A of the Code as specified under the PEP or as otherwise provided by the Committee in its sole discretion: the Participant s death, the Participant s qualifying disability (under Section XIII (C)) or a Change in Control (within the meaning of the 2010 ICP, which includes a definition of change in control that complies with Section 409A of the Code). Any portion of a Participant Purchased RSU and Company Matching RSU that has become vested in accordance with the terms of the PEP shall be settled as provided under the PEP on a date selected by the Company occurring prior to the 15   th    day of the third calendar month following the applicable vesting date. In the event that a Participant experiences a termination of employment and is granted severance and is therefore permitted to continue to vest in one or more installments of a Participant Purchased RSU or Company Matching RSU Award pursuant to Section XIII (A), such installments shall continue to be subject to settlement only after the vesting date originally applicable to such installments and during the settlement period set forth above in this Section XIV (C). In the event that the Committee exercises its sole discretion to waive the forfeiture provisions applicable to any Participant Purchased RSUs or Company Matching RSUs, those RSUs shall be settled at the same time that they would otherwise have been settled if they had vested in due course under the terms of the PEP and the applicable Award.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the PEP or any Award to the contrary, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, any settlement amounts to which a Participant may become entitled under the PEP, which are subject to Section 409A of the Code (and not otherwise exempt from its application), that are payable within six months following the date of termination will be withheld until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date of termination. To the extent any provisions of the PEP or any RSU does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, the Company and any affected Participant will make such changes  

- 7 - 

with respect to such RSU as are mutually acceptable in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 
  XV. Recoupment Policy.   Except as may be specifically provided in the Award agreement, each Award under the PEP  shall be subject to the terms of the Company s Recoupment Policy as it exists from time to time, which may require the Participant to immediately repay to the Company the value of any pre-tax economic benefit that he or she may derive from the Award.  By accepting an Award under the PEP, Participant acknowledges that the Company s Recoupment Policy has been made available for the Participant s reference.

     The PBRS Plan shall be administered by the Management Planning and Development Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors, or its designee, under the provisions of the 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the  2010 ICP ).  The Committee shall have full and final authority, in each case, subject to and consistent with the provisions of the 2010 ICP and the PBRS Plan, to construe and interpret rules and regulations for the administration of the PBRS Plan, correct defects, supply omissions or reconcile inconsistencies therein, and to make all other decisions and determinations as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the PBRS Plan.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the 2010 ICP.

           V. 
    Plan Performance Measures 
       A.     Unless otherwise approved by the Committee, PBRS funding is based on consolidated Company performance, measured by Operating Profit, Pharmacy Benefit Management ( PBM ) Client Satisfaction, and Retail Customer Service as defined below.  Achievement of the Company s Operating Profit target will determine 80% of total funding; achievement of PBM Client Satisfaction targets will determine 10% of the total funding; and achievement of the Retail Customer Service target, as measured by  myCustomer Experience  scores, will determine the remaining 10% of the total funding. 
    
  1.      Operating Profit 
  Operating Profit is determined by reference to EBIT (see Exhibit A) and may be adjusted by the financial adjustments as approved by the Committee prior to the end of the first fiscal quarter of the Plan Year.   
    
  If Operating Profit is below the minimum threshhold of 96.9% (see Exhibit B), no formulaic funding will be made available for incentive awards, regardless of Retail Customer Service and PBM Client Satisfaction performance, and there shall be no  PBRS Awards paid. 
  2.      PBM Client Satisfaction 
  Achievement of the PBM Client Satisfaction component of incentive funding will be determined by the aggregate actual performance against target (see Exhibit B) of the weighted composite of the following surveys: 
             
    Client Relationship and Loyalty Survey (weight = 50%) 
                
    Mail Service Pharmacy and Customer Care Survey (weight = 25%) 
                
    Specialty Pharmacy Satisfaction Survey (weight = 25%) 
     PBM Client Satisfaction funding is subject to adjustment based on Operating Profit. 
  3.    Retail Customer Service 
  The Retail Customer Service component of the incentive funding will be determined using the myCustomer Experience actual performance against the target (see Exhibit B).  The myCustomer Experience score is derived based on Rx Score and Front Store score and assigned weightings. 
    
  Retail Customer Service funding is subject to adjustment based on Operating Profit.

           A. 
    Target PBRS Award 
     The target PBRS Award for each Participant is 25% of the base salary in effect as of the last day of the PBRS Plan Year. 
    
  B.    PBRS Award Determination and Vesting 
  After the achievement of at least threshold for Operating Profit has been confirmed, performance of PBM Client Satisfaction and Retail Customer Service compared to target for the Plan Year will be calculated.  Total funding for PBRS Awards will be fully based (100%) on consolidated Company performance. 
    
  The PBRS Award is equal to the Award Payout Percentage multiplied by the Participant s base salary as of the last day of the PBRS Plan Year, generally payable in RSUs.  The number of RSUs that the Participant will receive is equal to the PBRS Award divided by the closing price of Company common stock on the PBRS Award Date. 
    
  C.    Vesting 
  The RSUs issued in respect of any PBRS Award will vest in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the 2010 ICP and the applicable agreement for each PBRS Award.  PBRS Awards unvested as of a Participant s termination of employment shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement for each PBRS Award and the PBRS Plan in effect at the time of grant of each award. 
    
  VII.       Plan Administration 
    
  A.    Employment Rights 
  The PBRS Plan does not create any express or implied contract of employment between the Company and an Eligible Employee. Both the Company and an Eligible Employee (whether or not a Participant) retain the right to terminate the employment relationship at any time and for any reason. 
    
  B.    Rights are Non-Assignable 
  Neither a Participant nor any beneficiary nor any other person shall have any right to assign the right to receive payments hereunder, in whole or in part, which payments are non-assignable and non-transferable, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. 
    
  C.    Change in Control 
  In the event of a Change in Control, the PBRS Plan shall remain in full force and effect.  Any modifications to or dissolution of the PBRS Plan by the acquiring entity may only occur prospectively and will not affect entitlements, awards or eligibility before the date of the Change in Control. 
    
  D.    Plan Amendment/Modification/Termination 
  The Company retains the right to amend, modify, or terminate the PBRS Plan for any reason and at any time on or before December 31 of the PBRS Plan Year, with or without notice to Eligible Employees.  No representative of the Company or its subsidiaries has the authority to modify the terms of this PBRS Plan without written consent of the Chief Human Resources Officer or his or her designee. 
    
  E.    Withholding 
  The Company may provide for the withholding from any benefits payable under the PBRS Plan all federal, state, city or other taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling. 
    
  F.    Section 409A of the Code 
  The Company intends that the PBRS Plan not violate any applicable provision of, or result in any additional tax or penalty under, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the  Code ), as amended, and the regulations and guidance thereunder (collectively,  Section 409A ) and that to the extent any provisions of the PBRS Plan do not comply with Section 409A the Company will make such changes as it deems reasonable in order to comply with Section 409A.  In all events, the provisions of CVS Health Corporation s Universal 409A Definitions Document are hereby incorporated by reference and, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award to the contrary, to the extent required to avoid a violation of the applicable rules under Section 409A by reason of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, payment of any amounts subject to  
  
   4 

Section 409A shall be delayed until the first business day of the seventh month immediately following the date of termination of employment. For purposes of any provision of the PBRS Plan providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits in connection with a termination of employment, references to an Eligible Employee s  termination of employment  (and corollary terms) shall be construed to refer to the Eligible Employee s  separation from service  with the Company as determined under Section 409A. 
    
  G.    Request for     Plan Interpretation 
  Any dispute or request for interpretation of any provision in the PBRS Plan must be submitted to the appropriate Human Resources Business Partner by the Eligible Employee or his or her manager in writing.   
    
  H.    Compliance with Applicable Regulations 
  In order to be eligible to receive a PBRS Award under the PBRS Plan, a Participant must comply with all applicable state and federal regulations and Company policies. 
    
  I.   Governing Law 
  The validity, construction and effect of the PBRS Plan, and any rules and regulations under the Plan shall be determined in accordance with Delaware law, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws and applicable federal law. 
    
    J.   Recoupment 
  Except as may be specifically provided in the PBRS Award, each PBRS Award under the PBRS Plan shall be subject to the terms of the Company s Recoupment Policy as it exists from time to time, which may require the Participant to immediately repay to the Company the value of any pre-tax economic benefit that he or she may derive under the PBRS Plan.

  GRANT DATE  :    APRIL __, ____ 
    
           1. 
    Pursuant and subject to the provisions of the 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the    ICP   ) of CVS Health Corporation (the    Company   ), on the date set forth above (the    Grant Date   ), the Company has awarded and hereby evidences the Restricted Stock Unit (   RSU   ) Award to the person named below (the    Participant   ), subject to the terms and conditions set forth and incorporated in this Restricted Stock Unit agreement (the    Agreement   ).  The ICP is hereby made a part hereof and Participant agrees to be bound by all the provisions of the ICP.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term(s) in the ICP.  Except as expressly provided below in Sections 4 and 7, upon termination of employment the treatment of RSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed under and subject to the terms of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between the Company and the Participant dated December 22, 2008, as amended December 21, 2012 (the    Employment Agreement   ).  On the Grant Date specified above, the Fair Market Value (the  FMV ), which is the Closing Price of the Company s common stock on the Grant Date, of each RSU equals   $XXX.XX. 
       
                 Participant: 
    Larry J. Merlo 
      Employee ID: 
    XXXXXX 
      RSUs (#): 
    XXXXX 

2. 
    Each RSU represents a right to a future payment of one share (   Share   ) of Common Stock ($0.01 par value) of the Company, subject to required tax withholding. 
       
           3. 
    (a)    To the extent dividends are paid on Shares while the RSUs remain outstanding and prior to the Settlement Date (as defined below), subject to Section 5(b), Participant shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equivalent to the cash dividends with respect to the number of Shares covered by the RSUs; provided, however, that no dividends shall be payable with respect to any RSUs forfeited on or prior to the dividend record date. 
       
  (b)    Participant hereby agrees that the Company may withhold from the dividend equivalent amounts referred to in Paragraph 3(a) above amounts sufficient to satisfy the applicable tax withholding in respect of such dividend equivalent payments. 
    
           4. 
    Subject to the terms and conditions of the ICP and this Agreement and subject to Participant s continued employment, Participant shall be entitled to receive (and the Company shall deliver to Participant) the Shares on the Vesting Date(s) set forth herein, or as soon as administratively practicable, but within 30 days thereafter, (or in the Employment Agreement, as the case may be), unless delivery of the Shares has been deferred in accordance with Section 5 below (the date of such delivery of the Shares being hereafter referred to as the    Settlement Date   ).  Each    Vesting Date    , except as otherwise provided in Section 7,  shall be in accordance with the schedule set forth below:  
       
           (a) 
    50% of the RSUs shall vest on the third anniversary of the Grant Date ( Tranche A  
              (b) 
    50% of the RSUs shall vest on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date ( Tranche B  
       
  Provided, however, that a fraction of the Shares in Tranche A and Tranche B shall vest earlier on the effective date of the Participant s Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreement) so long as: 
  
   1 

(i) 
    Participant provides at least 12 months  advance notice to the Committee of his intent to take Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement,  
              (ii) 
    Participant fully cooperates with the Company in transitioning his duties during the period between the disclosure to the Committee of his intent to take Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement and his retirement date,  
              (iii) 
    Participant continues to be employed by the Company through the Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement date, and  
              (iv) 
    the Committee approves such vesting terms (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), and, in the case of an Approved Early Retirement, approves such retirement.   
       
  If the foregoing conditions are satisfied, the number of RSUs that vest on the Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement date shall be calculated as follows:  (A) the number of Shares from Tranche A that vest shall be the total number of Shares in Tranche A multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the whole number of months worked from the Grant Date through the Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement date and the denominator is thirty-six (36);  (B) the number of Shares from Tranche B that vest shall be the total number of Shares in Tranche B multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the whole number of months worked from the Grant Date through the Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement date and the denominator is sixty (60).  For purposes of this calculation, the number of months in the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall include any partial month in which Participant has worked.  The Vesting Date shall be the effective date of the Participant s termination of employment as a result of Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement. Any Shares represented by RSUs that vest under this Section 4 shall settle in accordance with the original schedule set forth above. 
    
           5. 
    (a)    In accordance with rules promulgated by the Management Planning and Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the    Committee   ), Participant, to the extent eligible under the CVS Health Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, may elect to defer delivery of Shares in settlement of RSUs covered by this Agreement.  Any such deferred delivery date elected by Participant shall become the Settlement Date for purposes of this RSU Agreement. 
       
  (b)    Notwithstanding Section 3(a), to the extent dividends are paid on such deferred Shares following the Vesting Date and prior to the Settlement Date, Participant shall be entitled to receive  a number of additional deferred Shares equal to: (x) the amount of dividend per Share as declared by the Company s Board of Directors on the Company s common stock multiplied by (y) the number of deferred Shares held by Participant on the record date of such dividend, divided by (z) the FMV of a Share on such dividend payment date.   
    
           6. 
    On the Settlement Date the number of Shares to be delivered by the Company to Participant shall be reduced by the smallest number of Shares having a FMV at least equal to the dollar amount of Federal, state and local tax withholding required to be withheld by the Company with respect to such RSUs on such date.   
       
           7. 
    (a)     Except as provided in Paragraphs 7(b)   (e) below, if, for any reason other than Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement, Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates, all RSUs not then vested in accordance with Section 4 above shall be treated in accordance with the Employment Agreement.  In the event of a conflict between the Employment Agreement and the provisions in Sections 7(b)   (e) of this Agreement, this Agreement shall control. 
       
  (b)    In the event Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company, terminates for Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or as a result of voluntary termination (as described in Section 10(d) of the Employment Agreement), all RSUs not then vested shall be immediately forfeited.  
    
           (c) 
    (i)    In the event Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates prior to the third anniversary of the Grant Date, by reason of total and permanent disability (as defined in the Company s Long-Term Disability Plan, or, if not defined in such Plan, as defined by the Social Security Administration),  the RSUs shall vest on a pro rata basis as follows:  the total number of RSUs vested as of the termination date, which is the last date that the Participant is employed by the Company and any subsidiary of the Company, shall be equal to the number of RSUs granted on the Grant Date multiplied by the following fraction:  (A) the numerator shall be the whole number of months elapsed Participant s termination date and (B) the denominator shall be thirty-six (36).  For purposes of  
     
   2 

this calculation, the number of months in the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall include any partial month in which Participant has worked.  For example, if the time elapsed between the Grant Date and the termination date is eight months and five days, the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall be nine.  The Vesting Date shall be the effective date of the Participant s termination of employment. Any Shares represented by RSUs that vest under this section shall settle on the Settlement Date that would have applied under the original schedule set forth in Section 4 of this RSU Agreement. 
  (ii)    In the event the Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates on or after the third anniversary, but prior to the fifth anniversary, of the Grant Date, by reason of total and permanent disability (as defined in the Company s Long-Term Disability Plan, or, if not defined in such Plan, as defined by the Social Security Administration), the remaining unvested RSUs shall vest on a pro rata basis according to the following formula:  50% of the RSUs granted on the Grant Date multiplied by the following fraction:  (C) the numerator shall be the whole number of months elapsed as of the termination date since the Grant Date as of Participant s termination date and (D) the denominator shall be sixty (60).  For purposes of this calculation, the number of months in the numerator in sub-section (C) above shall include any partial month in which Participant has worked.  For example, if the time elapsed between the Grant Date and the termination date is fifty-four months and five days, the numerator in sub-section (C) above shall be fifty-five.  The Vesting Date shall be the effective date of the Participant s termination of employment. Any Shares represented by RSUs that vest under this section shall settle on the Settlement Date that would have applied under the original schedule set forth in Section 4 of this RSU Agreement. 
    
  (d)    Notwithstanding the above, (i) the provisions of Section 10 of the ICP shall apply in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in such Section 10) and (ii) the provisions of Section 7(e)(iv) of the ICP shall apply. 
    
  (e)    For purposes of this Section 7, transfer of Participant s employment from the Company to a subsidiary of the Company, transfer among or between subsidiaries of the Company, or transfer from a subsidiary of the Company to the Company shall not be treated as termination of employment. 
    
           8. 
    An RSU does not represent an equity interest in the Company and carries no voting rights.  Participant shall have no rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs until the Shares have been delivered to Participant. 
       
           9. 
    Neither the execution and delivery hereof nor the granting of the award evidenced hereby shall constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, on the part of the Company or its subsidiaries to employ Participant for any specific period. 
       
  10.   Any notice required to be given hereunder to the Company shall be in writing addressed to:  CVS Health Corporation, Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, One CVS Drive, Woonsocket, RI 02895. Any notice required to be given hereunder to Participant shall be addressed to such Participant at the address shown on the records of the Company, subject to the right of either party hereafter to designate, in writing, to the other, some other address. 
    
  11.   All decisions and interpretations made by the Board of Directors or the Committee with regard to any question arising hereunder or under the ICP shall be binding and conclusive on all persons.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the provisions of the ICP, the ICP shall govern.  
    
  12.   By accepting this Award, Participant acknowledges that a copy of the ICP has been made available by the Company for Participant s reference and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the ICP as in effect from time to time. 
    
  13.   By accepting this Award, Participant further acknowledges that the Federal securities laws and/or Company s policies regarding trading in its securities may limit or restrict Participant s right to trade Shares, including without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in connection with RSUs.  Participant agrees to comply with such Federal securities law requirements and Company policies as such laws and policies may be amended from time to time. 
    
  14.    The Company intends that this Agreement not violate any applicable provision of, or result in any additional tax or penalty under, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the  Code ), as amended, and that to the extent any provisions of this Agreement do not comply with Code Section 409A the Company will make such  
  
   3 

changes in order to comply with Code Section 409A to the extent it considers reasonable.  In all events, the provisions of CVS Health Corporation s 409A Universal Definitions Document are hereby incorporated by reference and to the extent required to avoid a violation of the applicable rules under all Section 409A by reason of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, payment of any amounts subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed until the first business day of the seventh month immediately following the employment termination date.  For purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment, references to a  termination of employment  (and corollary terms) shall be construed to refer to a  separation from service  (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations as to the tax treatment or consequences of any payment made hereunder, and Participant, by accepting this Award, acknowledges that Participant shall be solely responsible for same. 
    
  15.    The Award subject to this RSU Agreement under the ICP shall be subject to the terms of the Company s Recoupment Policy as it exists from time to time, which may require the Participant to immediately repay to the Company the value of any pre-tax economic benefit that he  may derive from the Award. By accepting this Award Participant acknowledges that the Company s Recoupment Policy has been made available for the Participant s reference. 
    
  16.   This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Delaware, without giving effect to its choice of law provisions. 
    
  17.    This Agreement shall be fully effective only upon the Participant s formal acceptance of the terms and conditions set forth above as required by the Company.

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION 
  BUSINESS PLANNING COMMITTEE 
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT   ANNUAL GRANT 
  GRANT DATE  :    APRIL 1, 2016 

1. 
    Pursuant and subject to the provisions of the 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the    ICP   ) of CVS Health Corporation (the    Company   ), on the date set forth above (the    Grant Date   ), the Company has awarded and hereby evidences the Restricted Stock Unit (   RSU   ) Award to the person named below (the    Participant   ), subject to the terms and conditions set forth and incorporated in this Restricted Stock Unit agreement (the    Agreement   ). The ICP is hereby made a part hereof and Participant agrees to be bound by all the provisions of the ICP.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term(s) in the ICP. On the Grant Date specified above, the Fair Market Value (the  FMV ), which is the Closing Price of the Company s common stock on the Grant Date, of each RSU equals   $104.82. 
       
                 Participant: 
    Jonathan C. Roberts 
      Employee ID: 
    XXXXX 
      RSUs (#): 
    21,465 

2. 
    Each RSU represents a right to a future payment of one share (   Share   ) of Common Stock ($0.01 par value) of the Company, subject to required tax withholding. 
       
           3. 
    (a)    To the extent dividends are paid on Shares while the RSUs remain outstanding and prior to the Settlement Date (as defined below), subject to Section 5(b), Participant shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equivalent to the cash dividends with respect to the number of Shares covered by the RSUs; provided, however, that no dividends shall be payable with respect to any RSUs forfeited on or prior to the dividend record date. 
       
  (b)    Participant hereby agrees that the Company may withhold from the dividend equivalent amounts referred to in Paragraph 3(a) above amounts sufficient to satisfy the applicable tax withholding in respect of such dividend equivalent payments. 
    
           4. 
    Subject to the terms and conditions of the ICP and this Agreement and subject to Participant s continued employment, Participant shall be entitled to receive (and the Company shall deliver to Participant) the Shares on the Vesting Date(s) set forth herein, or as soon as administratively practicable, but within 30 days thereafter, unless delivery of the Shares has been deferred in accordance with Section 5 below (the date of such delivery of the Shares being hereafter referred to as the    Settlement Date   ).  Each    Vesting Date  ,  except as otherwise provided in Section 7, shall be in accordance with the schedule set forth below:  
       
  (a) 50% of the RSUs shall vest on the third anniversary of the Grant Date; 
  (b) 50% of the RSUs shall vest on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date. 

5. 
    (a)    In accordance with rules promulgated by the Management Planning and Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the    Committee   ), Participant, to the extent eligible under the CVS Health Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, may elect to defer delivery of Shares in settlement of RSUs covered by this Agreement.  Any such deferred delivery date elected by Participant shall become the Settlement Date for purposes of this RSU Agreement. 
       
  (b)    Notwithstanding Section 3(a), to the extent dividends are paid on such deferred Shares following the Vesting Date and prior to the Settlement Date, Participant shall be entitled to receive  a number of additional deferred Shares equal to: (x) the amount of dividend per Share as declared by the Company s Board of Directors on the Company s common stock multiplied by (y) the number of deferred Shares held by Participant on the record date of such dividend, divided by (z) the FMV of a Share on such dividend payment date.   
    
           6. 
    On the Settlement Date the number of Shares to be delivered by the Company to Participant shall be reduced by the smallest number of Shares having a FMV at least equal to the dollar amount of Federal, state and local tax withholding required to be withheld by the Company with respect to such RSUs on such date.  
       
           7. 
    (a)     Except as provided in Paragraphs 7 (b)   (f) below, if, for any reason, Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates, all RSUs not then vested in accordance with Section 4 above shall be immediately forfeited. 
       
  (b)  In the event Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates by reason of death, RSUs not then vested in accordance with Section 4 will become immediately vested and the Vesting Date shall be the date of death. 
    
  (c)  (i) In the event Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates prior to the third anniversary of the Grant Date by reason of a    Qualified Retirement   , the following shall apply:  
    
  (1) RSUs that are unvested as of the Participant s retirement date, which is the last day that the Participant is employed by the Company and any subsidiary of the Company, shall vest as of the Participant s retirement date on a pro rata basis as follows:  the total number of RSUs vesting as of the retirement date shall be equal to the number of RSUs granted on the Grant Date multiplied by the following fraction:  (A) the numerator shall be the whole number of months elapsed as of the retirement date since the Grant Date and (B) the denominator shall be thirty-six (36).  For purposes of this calculation, the number of months in the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall include any partial month in which Participant has worked.  For example, if the time elapsed between the Grant Date and the retirement date is eight months and five days, the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall be nine, and any Shares represented by RSUs that so vest shall settle in accordance with the original schedule set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement; and  
    
  (2) Provided that Participant has executed and complies in all respects with the    Restrictive Covenant Agreement   , upon his Qualified Retirement and his compliance with the Restrictive Covenant Agreement through the expiration of its term, Participant shall vest in any RSUs that are unvested as of his retirement date, as determined after the application of the provisions of subsection (1) above, on the last day of the three-year restrictive period, and the RSUs shall settle on that same day.  

(ii) In the event Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates on or after the third anniversary, but prior to the fifth anniversa  ry of the Grant Date   by reason of a    Qualified Retirement   , the following shall apply:  
    
  (1) RSUs that are unvested as of the Participant s retirement date, which is the last day that the Participant is employed by the Company and any subsidiary of the Company, shall vest as of the Participant s retirement date on a pro rata basis as follows:  the total number of RSUs vesting as of the retirement date shall be equal to 50% of the RSUs granted on the Grant Date multiplied by the following fraction:  (A) the numerator shall be the whole number of months elapsed as of the retirement date since the Grant Date and (B) the denominator shall be sixty (60).  For purposes of this calculation, the number of months in the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall include any partial month in which Participant has worked.  For example, if the time elapsed between the Grant Date and the retirement date is eight months and five days, the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall be nine, and any Shares represented by RSUs that so vest shall settle in accordance with the original schedule set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement; and  
    
  (2) Provided that Participant has executed and complies in all respects with the    Restrictive Covenant Agreement   , upon his Qualified Retirement and his compliance with the Restrictive Covenant Agreement through the expiration of its term, Participant shall vest in any RSUs that are unvested as of his retirement date, as determined after the application of the provisions of subsection (1) above, on the last day of the three-year restrictive period, and the RSUs shall settle on that same day.  
    
     Restrictive Covenant Agreement    shall mean the restrictive covenant agreement in the form required by the Company in connection with the grant hereunder, attached hereto as Exhibit A, that sets forth restrictive covenants, such as non-competition, non-disclosure, and/or non-solicitation obligations, for a three-year period immediately following Participant s employment termination, as well as any later restrictive covenant agreement that may be required by the Company.  
    
     Qualified Retirement    shall mean termination of employment on or after attainment of age fifty-five (55) with at least ten (10) years of continuous service or attainment of age sixty (60) with at least five (5) years of continuous service, provided that:  (i) if Participant elects to terminate his  employment voluntarily, Participant has provided the Company with at least twelve (12) months advance written notice of his  retirement and retirement date or (ii) if the Company elects to terminate Participant s employment, such termination is without cause; and (iii) in either case, such retirement and retirement date have been approved by the Committee. In the event Participant s termination of employment qualifies as a Qualified Retirement and Participant also enters into a severance agreement with the Company, the terms of this Section 7(c) shall apply.  
    
  (d)        (i)  In the event Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates prior to the third anniversary of the Grant Date  by reason of total and permanent disability (as defined in the Company s Long-Term Disability Plan, or, if not defined in such Plan, as defined by the Social Security Administration), the RSUs shall vest as of the employment termination date on a pro rata basis as follows:  the total number of RSUs vested as of the termination date, which is the last date that the Participant is employed by the Company and any subsidiary of the Company, shall be equal to the number of RSUs granted on the Grant Date multiplied by the following fraction:  (A) the numerator shall be the whole number of months elapsed as of Participant s termination date since the Grant Date and (B) the denominator shall be thirty-six (36).  For purposes  

of this calculation, the number of months in the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall include any partial month in which Participant has worked.  For example, if the time elapsed between the Grant Date and the termination date is eight months and five days, the numerator in sub-section (A) above shall be nine.  Any Shares represented by RSUs that vest under this section shall settle on the Settlement Date that would have applied under the original schedule set forth in Section 4 of this RSU Agreement. 
    
  (ii)  In the event the Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates after the third anniversary, but prior to the fifth anniversary, of the Grant Date,  by reason of total and permanent disability (as defined in the Company s Long-Term Disability Plan, or, if not defined in such Plan, as defined by the Social Security Administration), the remaining unvested RSUs shall vest as of the employment termination date on a pro rata basis according to the following formula:  50% of the RSUs granted on the Grant Date multiplied by the following fraction:  (C) the numerator shall be the whole number of months elapsed as of the termination date since the Grant Date as of Participant s termination date and (D) the denominator shall be sixty (60).  For purposes of this calculation, the number of months in the numerator in sub-section (C) above shall include any partial month in which Participant has worked.  For example, if the time elapsed between the Grant Date and the termination date is fifty-four months and five days, the numerator in sub-section (C) above shall be fifty-five. Any Shares represented by RSUs that vest under this section shall settle on the Settlement Date that would have applied under the original schedule set forth in Section 4 of this RSU Agreement. 
    
  (e)    In the event Participant s employment with the Company and any subsidiary of the Company terminates and Participant receives severance pay, RSUs not vested at the time of Participant s employment termination date but scheduled to vest during the severance period specified in the agreement providing for severance pay shall vest as of the Participant s employment termination date and settle in accordance with the original schedule set forth in Section 4 of this RSU Agreement. All RSUs not scheduled to vest during the specified severance period shall be forfeited as of the last day of the Participant s severance period. In the event that Participant returns to employment with the Company or any subsidiary prior to the expiration of the severance period specified in a severance agreement with the Company, Participant shall be treated as if his employment with the Company or any subsidiary of the Company had continued through the severance period for purposes of determining eligibility for continued vesting. In the event Participant s termination of employment qualifies as a Qualified Retirement the terms of Section 7(c) shall apply.  
    
  (f)    Notwithstanding the above, (i) the provisions of Section 10 of the ICP shall apply in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in such Section 10) and (ii) the provisions of Section 7(e)(iv) of the ICP shall apply. 
    
  (g)    For purposes of this Section 7, transfer of Participant s employment from the Company to a subsidiary of the Company, transfer among or between subsidiaries of the Company, or transfer from a subsidiary of the Company to the Company shall not be treated as a termination of employment. 
    
  (h)    Participant will be responsible for any applicable withholding or other taxes that may become due as a result of RSUS that vest as of Participant s employment termination date or thereafter. 
    
           8. 
    An RSU does not represent an equity interest in the Company and carries no voting rights.  Participant shall have no rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs until the Shares have been delivered to Participant. 

9. 
    Neither the execution and delivery hereof nor the granting of the award evidenced hereby shall constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, on the part of the Company or its subsidiaries to employ Participant for any specific period. 
       
           10. 
    Any notice required to be given hereunder to the Company shall be addressed in writing to:  CVS Health Corporation, Senior Vice President, Compensation   Benefits, One CVS Drive, Woonsocket, RI 02895. Any notice required to be given hereunder to Participant shall be addressed to such Participant at the address shown on the records of the Company, subject to the right of either party hereafter to designate, in writing, to the other, some other address. 
       
           11. 
    All decisions and interpretations made by the Board of Directors or the Committee with regard to any question arising hereunder or under the ICP shall be binding and conclusive on all persons.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the provisions of the ICP, the ICP shall govern.  
       
           12. 
    The award of RSUs pursuant to this Agreement is expressly subject to and contingent upon the requirement that the Participant shall have fully executed and delivered to the Company the Restrictive Covenant Agreement attached as Exhibit A.   
       
  Participant agrees to execute and deliver such agreement by the deadline set forth by the Company, which shall be no less than ten days from the date it is provided to Participant.  
    
  Participant agrees that failure to execute and return the Restrictive Covenant Agreement by the deadline set forth by the Company shall result in the immediate and irrevocable forfeiture of the RSU Award hereunder and any right to receive dividend equivalents or Shares with respect thereto.  Further, if Participant violates any provision of the Restrictive Covenant Agreement, any unvested RSUs will be immediately and irrevocably forfeited, and no payment of any kind, including dividend equivalents or Shares, shall be payable with respect thereto.  This Section shall not constitute the Company s exclusive remedy for Participant s violation of the Restrictive Covenant Agreement, and the Company may seek all available legal or equitable remedies in the event of Participant s violation or threatened of the Restrictive Covenant Agreement, including injunctive relief.  
    
  13.   By accepting this Award, Participant acknowledges that a copy of the ICP has been made available by the Company for Participant s reference and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the ICP as in effect from time to time, including the requirement that Participant sign and return the Restrictive Covenant Agreement, as required by the Company as set forth in Section 12.  
    
  14.   By accepting this Award, Participant further acknowledges that the Federal securities laws and/or Company s policies regarding trading in its securities may limit or restrict Participant s right to trade Shares, including without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in connection with RSUs.  Participant agrees to comply with such Federal securities law requirements and Company policies as such laws and policies may be amended from time to time. 
    
  15.   The Company intends that this Agreement not violate any applicable provision of, or result in any additional tax or penalty under, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the  Code ), as amended, and that to the extent any provisions of this Agreement do not comply with Code Section 409A the Company will make such changes in order to comply with Code Section 409A to the extent it considers reasonable.  In all events, the provisions of CVS Health Corporation s 409A Universal Definitions Document are hereby incorporated by reference, and to the extent required to avoid a violation of the applicable rules under Section 409A by reason of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the  

Code, payment of any amounts subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed until the first business day of the seventh month immediately following the employment termination date.  For purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment, references to a  termination of employment  (and corollary terms) shall be construed to refer to a  separation from service  (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations as to the tax treatment or consequences of any payment made hereunder, and Participant, by accepting this Award, acknowledges that Participant shall be solely responsible for same. 
    
  16.   The Award subject to this RSU Agreement under the ICP shall be subject to the terms of the Company s Recoupment Policy as it exists from time to time, which may require the Participant to immediately repay to the Company the value of any pre-tax economic benefit that he or she may derive from the Award. By accepting this Award, Participant acknowledges that the Company s Recoupment Policy has been made available for the Participant s reference. 
    
  17.   This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Delaware, without giving effect to its choice of law provisions. 
    
  18.   This Agreement shall be fully effective only upon the Participant s formal acceptance of the terms and conditions set forth above as required by the Company.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.45 

CVS Pharmacy, Inc. 
  Restrictive Covenant Agreement 
    
  I, Jonathan C. Roberts, enter into this Restrictive Covenant Agreement ( Agreement ) with CVS Pharmacy, Inc. ( CVS ), which is effective as of the date I sign the Agreement (the  Effective Date ).  In consideration of the mutual promises in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows: 
    
  1.  Consideration for Agreement  .  I am entering into this Agreement in consideration of:  (a) the Corporation s award of restricted stock units as set forth in the  Restricted Stock Unit Agreement - Annual Grant dated April 1, 2016  (the  2016 RSU Agreement ) to which this Agreement is attached, contingent on my execution of this Agreement and compliance with its terms; and (b) in connection with my duties and responsibilities at CVS Health Corporation or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, the  Corporation ), the Corporation will provide me with Confidential Information and/or access to the Corporation s customers and clients and the opportunity to develop and maintain relationships and goodwill with them.  
  2.  Non-Competition  .  During my employment by the Corporation and during the Non-Competition Period following the termination of my employment for any reason, I will not, directly or indirectly, engage in Competition or provide Consulting or Audit Services within the Restricted Area. 
  a.      Competition  .  Engaging in  Competition  means providing services to a Competitor of the Corporation (whether as an employee, independent contractor, consultant, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, investor, or shareholder, except as a shareholder of less than one percent of a publicly traded company) that: (i) are the same or similar in function or purpose to the services I provided to the Corporation during the last two years of my employment by the Corporation, or (ii) will likely result in the disclosure of Confidential Information to a Competitor or the use of Confidential Information on behalf of a Competitor.  If a representative of the Corporation, during my employment or the Non-Competition Period, requests that I identify the company or business to which I will be or am providing services, or with which I will be or am employed, and requests that I provide information about the services that I am or will be providing to such entity, I shall provide the Corporation with a written statement detailing the identity of the entity and the nature of the services that I am or will be providing to such entity with sufficient detail to allow the Corporation to independently assess whether I am or will be in violation of this Agreement.  Such statement shall be delivered to the Corporation s Chief Human Resources Officer or her authorized delegate via personal delivery     or overnight delivery within five calendar days     of my receipt of such request. 
    
  b.      Com  petitor  .  A  Competitor  for purposes of this Agreement shall mean any person, corporation or other entity that competes with one or more of the business offerings of the Corporation.

The Parties acknowledge that both the Corporation s products and services and the entities that compete with the Corporation s products and services evolve and that an entity will be considered a Competitor if it provides products or services competitive with the products and services provided by the Corporation within the last two years of my employment. 
    
  Given my role in the Corporation, I agree to this enterprise-wide definition of non-competition that will prevent me from providing services to the Corporation s PBM, retail and MinuteClinic Competitors during the relevant time period.

  f.      Acknowledgment.    I acknowledge and agree that the geographic scope and duration of the restrictions set forth in this Section 2 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Corporation, including the Corporation s Confidential Information and good will, in light of the very senior position I hold with the Corporation and the highly sensitive information with which I have been and will be entrusted.

  d.      Acknowledgment.    I acknowledge and agree that the geographic scope and duration of the restrictions set forth in this Section 3 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Corporation, including the Corporation s Confidential Information and good will, in light of the very senior position I hold with the Corporation and the highly sensitive information with which I have been and will be entrusted.

  4.  Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information  . 
    a.    Subject to Section 7 below, I will not at any time, whether during or after the termination of my employment, disclose to any person or entity any of the Corporation s Confidential Information, except as may be appropriately required in the ordinary course of performing my duties as an employee of the Corporation.

I shall not use or attempt to use any Confidential Information on behalf of any person or entity other than the Corporation, or in any manner which may injure or cause loss or may be calculated to injure or cause loss, whether directly or indirectly, to the Corporation.  For employees residing in Connecticut, these restrictions on use or disclosure of Confidential Information will only apply for three (3) years after the end of my employment where information that does not qualify as a trade secret is concerned; however, the restrictions will continue apply to trade secret information for as long as the information at issue remains qualified as a trade secret.

During my employment, I shall not make, use, or permit to be used, any materials of any nature relating to any matter within the scope of the business of the Corporation or concerning any of its dealings or affairs other than for the benefit of the Corporation.

I agree that all the items described in this Section are the sole property of the Corporation  . 
  6.  Rights to Inventions, Works  . 
    a.      Assignment of Inventions.    All inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, improvements, designs, discoveries, ideas, trademarks or trade secrets, whether patentable or otherwise protectable under similar law, made, conceived or developed by me, whether alone or jointly with others, from the date of my initial employment by the Corporation and continuing until the end of any period during which I am employed by the Corporation, relating or pertaining in any way to my employment with or the business of the Corporation (collectively referred to as  Inventions ) shall be promptly disclosed in writing to the Corporation.  I hereby assign to the Corporation, or its designee, all of my rights, title and interest to such Inventions.  All original works of authorship which are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of my employment with the Corporation and which are protectable by copyright are  works made for hire,  as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act and as such are the sole property of the Corporation. The decision whether to commercialize or market any Invention developed by me solely or jointly with others is within the Corporation s sole discretion and for the Corporation s sole benefit and no royalty will be due to me as a result of the Corporation s efforts to commercialize or market any such Invention. 
  b.       Inventions Retained and Licensed.    I have attached hereto as Exhibit A, a list describing all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, improvements, and trade secrets which were made by me prior to my employment with the Corporation ( Prior Inventions ), which belong to me and are not assigned to the Corporation hereunder.  If no such list is attached, I represent that there are no such Prior Inventions.  I will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, any Prior Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest into a Corporation product, process or machine without the Corporation s prior written consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if, in the course of my employment with the Corporation, I incorporate into a Corporation product, process or machine a Prior Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest, the Corporation is hereby granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Prior Invention as part of or in connection with such product, process or machine.  
    
  c.      Patent and Copyright Registrations.    I will assist the Corporation, or its designee, at the Corporation s expense, in every proper way to secure the Corporation s rights in the Inventions and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto, including, but not limited to, the disclosure to the Corporation of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments and all other instruments which the Corporation shall deem necessary in order to apply for and obtain such rights and in order to assign and convey to the Corporation, its successors, assigns, and nominees the sole and exclusive rights, title and interest in and to such Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto.  My obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue after my employment ends for any reason and/or after the termination of this Agreement.  If the Corporation is unable because of my mental or physical incapacity or for any other reason to secure my signature to apply for or to pursue any application for any United States or foreign patents or copyright registrations covering Inventions or original works of authorship assigned to the Corporation as above, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Corporation and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent or copyright registrations thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.  
    
  d.      Exception to Assignments  .  I understand that if I am an employee in Illinois, Kansas, North Carolina, Utah or Minnesota, I should refer to Exhibit B (incorporated herein for all purposes) for important limitations on the scope of the provisions of this Agreement concerning assignment of Inventions.  I will advise the Corporation promptly in writing of any inventions that I believe meet the criteria in Exhibit B and that are not otherwise disclosed on Exhibit A. 
    
  7.  Cooperation  . 
    a.      In the event that I receive a subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order to testify or produce Confidential Information or any other information or property of the Corporation, I shall promptly: (a) notify the Corporation of the item, document, or information sought by such subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order; (b) furnish the Corporation with a copy of said subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order; and (c) provide reasonable cooperation with respect to any procedure that the Corporation may initiate to protect Confidential Information or other interests.  If the Corporation objects to the subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, process, or order, I shall cooperate to ensure that there shall be no disclosure until the court or other applicable entity has ruled upon the objection, and then only in accordance with the ruling so made.  If no such objection is made despite a reasonable opportunity to do so, I shall be entitled to comply with the subpoena, deposition, notice, interview request, or other process or order provided that I have fulfilled the above obligations  . 
    b.      I will cooperate fully with the Corporation, its affiliates, and their legal counsel in connection with any action, proceeding, or dispute arising out of matters with which I was directly or indirectly involved while serving as an employee of the Corporation, its predecessors, subsidiaries or affiliates.  This cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited to, meeting with, and providing information to, the Corporation and its legal counsel, maintaining the confidentiality of any past or future privileged communications with the Corporation s legal counsel (outside and in-house), and making myself available to testify truthfully by affidavit, in depositions, or in any other forum on behalf of the Corporation.  The Corporation agrees to reimburse me for any reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated with my cooperation. 
  8.  Limitation on Restrictions.    Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall interfere with my right to file charges or participate in a proceeding with any appropriate federal, state or local government agency, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, or to prohibit me from communicating or cooperating with any such agency in its investigation. 
  9.  Eligibility for Severance Pay  .  If my employment with the Corporation terminates under circumstances in which I am eligible for severance under the Corporation s Severance Plan for Non-Store Employees (the  Severance Plan ), the Corporation will offer me severance in accordance with the Severance Plan and the length of the Non-Competition Period will match the length of the severance period.  I acknowledge that the Severance Plan sets forth pre-requisites I must meet in order to receive severance, including but not limited to execution of the Corporation s standard separation agreement and release of claims.  In the event that the Corporation fails to comply with its obligations to offer me severance according to the Severance Plan, then Section 2 of this Agreement shall be of no further effect.  I agree that if I decline the Corporation s offer of severance, I shall continue to be subject to the restrictions in Section 2. 
  10.  Injunctive Relief  .  Any breach of this Agreement by me will cause irreparable damage to the Corporation and, in the event of such breach, the Corporation shall have, in addition to any and all remedies of law, the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent the violation of my obligations hereunder, and without providing a bond to the extent permitted by the applicable rules of civil procedure. 
  11.  No Right of Continued Employment  .  This Agreement does not create an obligation on the Corporation or any other person or entity to continue my employment. 
  12.  No Conflicting Agreements  .  I represent that the performance of my job duties with the Corporation and my compliance with all of the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to my employment by the Corporation. 
  13.  Entire Agreement/No Reliance/No Modifications  .  This Agreement and any compensation, benefit or equity plan or agreement referred to herein including the CVS Health Corporation Change in Control Agreement ( CIC Agreement ), to the extent those other agreements apply to me, set forth the entire agreement between the parties hereto and fully supersede any and all prior and/or supplemental understandings, whether written or oral, between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if I am a party to the CIC Agreement, then I understand that in the event of a Change in Control, as that term is defined in the CIC, Paragraph 2 of this Agreement shall be null and void.  I agree and acknowledge that I have not relied on any representations, promises or agreements of any kind in connection with my decision to accept the terms of this Agreement, except for the representations, promises and agreements herein.  Any modification to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by me and the Corporation s Chief Human Resources Officer or her authorized representative. 
  14.  No Waiver  .  Any waiver by the Corporation of a breach of any provision of this Agreement, or of any other similar agreement with any other current or former employee of the Corporation, shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or any other provision hereof. 
  15.  Severability  .  The parties hereby agree that each provision herein shall be treated as a separate and independent clause, and the unenforceability of any one clause shall in no way impair the enforceability of any of the other clauses herein.  Moreover, if one or more of the provisions of this Agreement are for any reason held to be excessively broad as to scope, activity, duration, subject or otherwise so as to be unenforceable at law, the parties consent to such provision or provisions being modified or limited by the appropriate judicial body (where allowed by applicable law), so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with the applicable law. 
  16.  Survival of Employee s Obligations  .  My obligations under this Agreement shall survive the termination of my employment regardless of the manner of such termination and shall be binding upon my heirs, personal representatives, executors, administrators and legal representatives. 
  17.  Corporation s Right to Assign Agreement  .  The Corporation has the right to assign this Agreement to its successors and assigns without the need for further agreement or consent by me, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by said successors or assigns. 
  18.  Non-Assignment  .  I shall not assign my rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the Corporation, and any such assignment contrary to the terms hereof shall be null and void and of no force or effect. 
  19.  Governing Law; Headings  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Rhode Island.  The headings of the sections contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be deemed to control or affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. 
  20.  Tolling.    In the event I violate one of the time-limited restrictions in this Agreement, I agree that the time period for such violated restriction shall be extended by one day for each day I have violated the restriction, up to a maximum extension equal to the length of the original period of the restricted covenant.  
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Agreement as a sealed instrument as of the date set forth below.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements that are included in this Annual Report. 

Overview of Our Business 
    
  CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively  CVS Health,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ), is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health. At the forefront of a changing health care landscape, the Company has an unmatched suite of capabilities and the expertise needed to drive innovations that will help shape the future of health care. 
    
  We are currently the only integrated pharmacy health care company with the ability to impact consumers, payors, and providers with innovative, channel-agnostic solutions. We have a deep understanding of their diverse needs through our unique integrated model, and we are bringing them innovative solutions that help increase access to quality care, deliver better health outcomes, and lower overall health care costs.  
    
  Through more than 9,700 retail locations, more than 1,100 walk-in health care clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with nearly 90 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year, expanding specialty pharmacy services and a leading stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, we enable people, businesses, and communities to manage health in more affordable, effective ways. We are delivering break-through products and services, from advising patients on their medications at our CVS Pharmacy        locations, to introducing unique programs to help control costs for our clients at CVS Caremark       , to innovating how care is delivered to our patients with complex conditions through CVS Specialty   TM   , to improving pharmacy care for the senior community through Omnicare       , or by expanding access to high-quality, low-cost care at CVS MinuteClinic       .    
    
  We have three reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. 

Overview of Our Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  Our Pharmacy Services business generates revenue from a full range of pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. 
    
  Our clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part D plans, Managed Medicaid plans, plans offered on the public and private exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States. A portion of covered lives primarily within the Managed Medicaid, health plan and employer markets have access to our services through public and private exchanges.  
    
  As a pharmacy benefits manager, we manage the dispensing of prescription drugs through our mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, long-term care pharmacies and national network of more than   68,000   retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately   41,000   chain pharmacies (which includes our CVS Pharmacy        pharmacies) and   27,000   independent pharmacies, to eligible members in the benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems to perform, among other things, safety checks, drug interaction screenings and brand-to-generic substitutions. 
    
  Our specialty pharmacies support individuals who require complex and expensive drug therapies. Our specialty pharmacy business includes mail order and retail specialty pharmacies that operate under the CVS Caremark       , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , Navarro        Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts ( ACS Pharmacy ) names. Substantially all of our mail service specialty pharmacies have been accredited by The Joint Commission, which is an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies health care organizations and programs in the United States. We also offer specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition services through Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ). With Specialty Connect       , which integrates our specialty pharmacy mail and retail capabilities, we provide members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to any CVS Pharmacy location. Whether submitted through our mail order pharmacy or at a CVS Pharmacy, all prescriptions are filled through the Company s specialty mail order pharmacies, so all revenue from this specialty prescription services program is recorded within the Pharmacy  
  
   1 

Services Segment. Members then can choose to pick up their medication at their local CVS Pharmacy or have it sent to their home through the mail. 
    
  We also provide health management programs, which include integrated disease management for   18   conditions, through our Accordant        rare disease management offering. The majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. 
    
  In addition, through our SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. As of December 31, 2016, we provided Medicare Part D plan benefits to approximately 5.5 million beneficiaries through SilverScript, including our individual and employer group waiver plans. 
    
  The Pharmacy Services Segment operates under the CVS Caremark        Pharmacy Services, Caremark       , CVS Caremark   TM   , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , Accordant       , SilverScript       , Coram       , CVS Specialty   TM   , NovoLogix       , Navarro        Health Services and ACS Pharmacy names. As of December 31, 2016, the Pharmacy Services Segment operated   23   retail specialty pharmacy stores,   13   specialty mail order pharmacies,   four   mail order dispensing pharmacies, and   84   branches for infusion and enteral services, including approximately   73   ambulatory infusion suites and   three   centers of excellence, located in   41   states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. 

Overview of Our Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  Our Retail/LTC Segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, personal care products, convenience foods, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise and greeting cards. With the acquisition of Omnicare's long-term care ( LTC ) operations, the Retail/LTC Segment now also includes the distribution of prescription drugs, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings, as well as commercialization services which are provided under the name RxCrossroads       . Our Retail/LTC Segment derives the majority of its revenues through the sale of prescription drugs, which are dispensed by our more than 32,000 pharmacists. The role of our retail pharmacists is expanding from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services, including flu vaccinations as well as face-to-face patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies, closing gaps in care, and more cost-effective drug therapies. Our integrated pharmacy services model enables us to enhance access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes. 
    
  Our Retail/LTC Segment also provides health care services through our MinuteClinic        health care clinics. MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions, and deliver vaccinations. We believe our clinics provide high quality services that are affordable and convenient.  
    
  Our proprietary loyalty card program, ExtraCare       , has about 65 million active cardholders, making it one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty card programs in the country.  
    
  As of December 31, 2016, our Retail/LTC Segment included   9,709   retail stores (of which   7,980   were our stores that operated a pharmacy and   1,674   were our pharmacies located within Target stores) located in   49   states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy       , CVS       , CVS Pharmacy y m s       , Longs Drugs       ,     Navarro Discount Pharmacy        and Drogaria Onofre   TM    names,   38   onsite pharmacies primarily operating under the CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , CarePlus        and CVS Pharmacy        names, and   1,139   retail health care clinics operating under the MinuteClinic        name (of which 1,132 were located in our retail pharmacy stores or Target stores), and our online retail websites, CVS.com       , Navarro.com     and Onofre.com.br. LTC operations are comprised of   152   spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders, of which   32   are also hub pharmacies that use proprietary automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC operates primarily under the Omnicare        and NeighborCare        names. 

Overview of Our Corporate Segment 
    
  The Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of our executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments.

Results of Operations 
    
  Summary of our Consolidated Financial Results 

Net revenues   increased   $24.2 billion   in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased $13.9 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. As you review our performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information: 

During 2016, net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased   19.5%   and net revenues in our Retail/LTC Segment increased   12.6%   compared to the prior year. The Retail/LTC Segment benefited from the 2015 acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. 

During 2015, net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased by 13.5% and net revenues in our Retail/LTC Segment increased 6.2% compared to the prior year. 

In 2016 and 2015, the Pharmacy Services Segment continued to grow from net new business and specialty. The increase in our generic dispensing rates in both of our operating segments continued to have a negative effect on net revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015, as well as in 2015 as compared to 2014.  
       
  Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about our net revenues. 
    
  Gross profit   increased $2.3 billion, or 8.8% in 2016, to   $28.9 billion  , as compared to $26.5 billion in 2015. Gross profit increased $1.2 billion, or 4.6% in 2015, to $26.5 billion, as compared to $25.4 billion in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined to 16.3%, as compared to 17.3% in 2015 and 18.2% in 2014. 

During 2016, gross profit in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment increased by   12.9%   and   7.9%  , respectively, compared to the prior year. For the year ended   December 31, 2016  , gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment was   4.9%   and   29.3%  , respectively. 

During 2015, gross profit in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment increased by 9.6% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment was 5.2% and 30.5%, respectively.

The increased weighting toward the Pharmacy Services Segment, which has a lower gross profit than the Retail/LTC Segment, resulted in a decline in consolidated gross profit as a percent of net revenues in 2016 as compared to 2015. In addition, gross profit for 2016 and 2015 has been negatively impacted by price compression in the Pharmacy Services Segment and reimbursement pressure in the Retail/LTC Segment.  

Our gross profit continued to benefit from the increased utilization of generic drugs, which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs, in both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments for 2016 and 2015, partially offsetting the negative impacts described above.  
       
  Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about our gross profit. 
    
  Operating expenses   increased $1.4 billion, or 8.5%, in the year ended   December 31, 2016  , as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenues declined to 10.4% in the year ended   December 31, 2016   compared to 11.1% in the prior year. The increase in operating expense dollars in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses in December 2015, the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015 and incremental store operating costs associated with a higher store count, partially offset by lower legal settlement costs in the year ended December 31, 2016. The improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 is primarily due to expense leverage from net revenue growth. 
    
  Operating expenses increased $506 million, or 3.0%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenues declined to 11.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 11.9% in the prior year. The increase in operating expense dollars in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to incremental store operating costs associated with a higher store count, the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015, the acquisition of the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses in December 2015 and a $90 million legal charge in 2015 related to a disputed 1999 legal settlement. The improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2015 is primarily due to expense leverage from net revenue growth. 
    
  Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about operating expenses. 
    
  Interest expense, net   for the years ended December 31 consisted of the following: 

Net interest expense increased $220 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the $15 billion debt issuance in July 2015, the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target, and the debt assumed from the Omnicare acquisition. See Note 5  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. During 2015, net interest expense increased by $238 million, to $838 million compared to 2014, primarily due to the amortization of bridge facility fees of $52 million for the unsecured bridge facility that was entered into on May 2015 and was amortized to interest expense over the period the facility was outstanding, the $15 billion debt issuance in July 2015, and the debt assumed in the Omnicare acquisition. 
    
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt   - During the year ended December 31, 2016,  the Company purchased approximately $4.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain of its senior notes pursuant to its tender offer for such senior notes and option to redeem the outstanding senior notes (see Note 5  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements). The Company paid a premium of $583 million in excess of the debt principal, wrote off $54 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $6 million in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $643 million. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company completed a $2.0 billion tender offer and repurchase of certain Senior Notes. The Company paid a premium of $490 million in excess of the debt principal in connection with the repurchase of the Senior Notes, wrote off $26 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $5 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $521 million. See Note 5,  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Income tax provision   - Our effective income tax rate was 38.4%, 39.3% and 39.5% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the resolution of income tax matters in open tax years through 2012, as well as other permanent items. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to certain permanent items in 2014.  

Income (loss) from discontinued operations   -     In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens  n Things, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The Company s loss from discontinued operations includes lease-related costs required to satisfy its Linens  n Things lease guarantees. We incurred a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $1 million in both 2016 and 2014. The Company s income from discontinued operations in 2015 of $9 million, net of tax, was related to the release of certain store lease guarantees due to the settlement of a dispute with a landlord.  
    
  See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies - Discontinued Operations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about discontinued operations and Note 11  Commitments and Contingencies  for additional information about our lease guarantees. 

Segment Analysis 
    
  We evaluate the performance of our Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments based on net revenues, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate Segment based on operating expenses before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains, and certain intersegment activities. The following is a reconciliation of the Company s business segments to the consolidated financial statements: 

(1) 
    Net revenues of the Pharmacy Services Segment include approximately   $10.5 billion  ,   $8.9 billion   and   $8.1 billion   of Retail/LTC Co-Payments for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Retail/LTC Co-Payments.  
              (2) 
    Intersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services Segment and the Retail/LTC Segment. These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients ( members ) fill prescriptions at our retail pharmacies to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice         elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of our retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at our long-term care pharmacies. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis. 
              (3) 
    The Retail/LTC Segment gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes   $46 million   of acquisition-related integration costs. The integration costs are related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. 
              (4) 
    The Pharmacy Services Segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the reversal of an accrual of   $88 million   in connection with a legal settlement. 
              (5) 
    The Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for the 2016 and 2015 include   $281 million   and   $64 million  , respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs. The integration costs are related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 also includes a   $34 million   asset impairment charge in connection with planned store closures in 2017 related to our enterprise streamlining initiative. 
              (6) 
    The Corporate Segment operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes integration costs of   $10 million   related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Corporate Segment operating loss includes   $156 million   of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target and a   $90 million   charge related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 legal settlement by MedPartners of various securities class actions and a related derivative claim.

Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  The following table summarizes our Pharmacy Services Segment s performance for the respective periods: 

(1)    
    Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail facility, which includes specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect        claims filled at retail, as well as prescriptions filled at our retail pharmacies under the Maintenance Choice        program.  
              (2) 
    Pharmacy network net revenues, claims processed and generic dispensing rates do not include Maintenance Choice, which are included within the mail choice category. Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including our retail pharmacies and long-term care pharmacies, but excluding Maintenance Choice activity. 
              (3) 
    The Pharmacy Services Segment operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the reversal of an accrual of   $88 million   in connection with a legal settlement. 
       
  Net revenues   in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased $19.6 billion, or   19.5%  , to   $120.0 billion   for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased pharmacy network claims, growth in specialty pharmacy, including the growth in Medicare Part D, addition of ACS Pharmacy through the acquisition of Omnicare, and inflation, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression.  
    
  Net revenues increased $11.9 billion, or 13.5%, to $100.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, driven by new clients, increased volume from new products and the addition of ACS Pharmacy through the acquisition of Omnicare, as well as inflation and increased pharmacy network claims. Conversely, the increase in our generic dispensing rate had a negative impact on our revenue in 2015, as it did in 2014. 
    
  As you review our Pharmacy Services Segment s revenue performance, we believe you should also consider the following important information about the business: 

Our mail choice claims processed increased 4.4% to   89.5 million   claims in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to   85.7 million   claims in the prior year. The increase in mail choice claims was driven by growth in specialty pharmacy claims, increase in net new business, and continuing adoption of our Maintenance Choice offerings. During 2015, our mail choice claims processed increased 4.0% to 85.7 million claims. The increase in mail choice claims was driven by net new business, specialty and continuing adoption of our Maintenance Choice offerings. 

6 

Our mail choice generic dispensing rate was   78.2%  , 76.4% and 74.6% in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our pharmacy network generic dispensing rate increased to   85.9%   in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 84.4% in the prior year. During 2015, our pharmacy network generic dispensing rate increased to 84.4% compared to our pharmacy network generic dispensing rate of 83.0% in 2014. These continued increases in mail choice and pharmacy network generic dispensing rates were primarily due to the impact of new generic drug introductions, and our continuous efforts to encourage plan members to use generic drugs when they are available. We believe our generic dispensing rates will continue to increase in future periods, albeit at a slower pace. This increase will be affected by, among other things, the number of new brand and generic drug introductions and our success at encouraging plan members to utilize generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate. 
       
  Gross profit   in our Pharmacy Services Segment includes net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues includes (i) the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed, either directly through our mail service and specialty retail pharmacies or indirectly through our pharmacy network, (ii) shipping and handling costs and (iii) the operating costs of our mail service dispensing pharmacies, customer service operations and related information technology support. 
    
  Gross profit increased $674 million, or   12.9%  , to   $5.9 billion   in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to   4.9%   for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 5.2% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, growth in Medicare Part D lives, higher generic dispensing and favorable purchasing economics, partially offset by price compression. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to changes in the mix of our business and continued price compression, partially offset by favorable generic dispensing and purchasing economics. 
    
  Gross profit increased $456 million, or 9.6% to $5.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 5.4% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to volume increases and higher generic dispensing, as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics, partially offset by price compression. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to price compression, partially offset by favorable generic dispensing, as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics. 
    
  As you review our Pharmacy Services Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information about the business: 

Our efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates and/or discounts we received from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on our gross profit dollars and gross profit as a percentage of net revenues. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused us and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, market dynamics and regulatory changes have limited our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network  differential  or  spread,  and we expect these trends to continue. The  differential  or  spread  is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.  

Our gross profit as a percentage of revenues benefited from the increase in our total generic dispensing rate, which increased to   85.4%   and 83.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, compared to our generic dispensing rate of 82.2% in 2014. These increases were primarily due to new generic drug introductions and our continual efforts to encourage plan members to use clinically appropriate generic drugs when they are available. We expect these trends to continue, albeit at a slower pace. The increased use by patients of generic drugs has also resulted in third party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments for prescriptions. This trend, which we expect to continue, reduces the benefit we realize from brand to generic product conversions.  
     
   7 

Operating expenses   in our Pharmacy Services Segment, which include selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization related to selling, general and administrative activities and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs, decreased to 1.0% of net revenues in 2016, compared to 1.2% in 2015 and 1.4% in 2014. 
    
  As you review our Pharmacy Services Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information about the business: 

Operating expenses decreased $9 million or 0.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating expense dollars is primarily due to an $88 million reversal of an accrual in connection with a legal settlement, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the growth of our business. 

Operating expenses decreased $19 million or 1.5%, to $1.2 billion, in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating expense dollars is primarily due to lower integration costs from the Coram acquisition which occurred in January 2014, partially offset by the addition of ACS Pharmacy from the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues improved slightly from 1.4% in 2014 to 1.2% in 2015.  

Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  The following table summarizes our Retail/LTC Segment s performance for the respective periods: 

(1) 
    Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes   $46 million   of acquisition-related integration costs related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.  
              (2) 
    Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include   $235 million   and   $64 million  , respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also includes a   $34 million   asset impairment charge in connection with planned store closures in 2017 related to our enterprise streamlining initiative. 
              (3) 
    Includes the adjustment to convert 90-day, non-specialty prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. 
              (4) 
    Same store sales and prescriptions exclude revenues from MinuteClinic, and revenue and prescriptions from stores in Brazil, from LTC operations and from commercialization services. 
              (5) 
    Front store same store sales would have been approximately   520   basis points higher for the year ended December 31, 2015 if tobacco and the estimated associated basket sales were excluded from the year ended December 31, 2014. 

8 

Net revenues   increased approximately $9.1 billion, or   12.6%  , to   $81.1 billion   for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisitions of the pharmacies and clinics of Target and new stores, which accounted for approximately 640 basis points of our total net revenue percentage increase during the year, the acquisition of Omnicare s LTC operations and a same store sales increase of   1.9%  . Net revenues increased approximately $4.2 billion, or 6.2%, to $72.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of LTC, a same store sales increase of 1.7%, and net revenues from new and acquired stores, which accounted for approximately 160 basis points of our total net revenue percentage increase during the year.      
    
  As you review our Retail/LTC Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information about the business: 

Front store same store sales declined   1.5%   in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by softer customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, partially offset by an increase in basket size.  

Pharmacy same store sales rose   3.2%   in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. Pharmacy same store sales were positively impacted by same store script growth of   3.6%  , as well as approximately 20 basis points due to an additional day in 2016 related to leap year for the year ended December 31, 2016. Due to marketplace changes in the latter half of 2016, we expect script growth to be negatively impacted for the next several quarters by restricted network relationships that exclude CVS Pharmacy. 

Pharmacy revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the conversion of brand name drugs to equivalent generic drugs, which typically have a lower selling price. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 360 and 390 basis points for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to recent generic introductions. The generic dispensing rate grew to   85.7%   for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 84.5% in the prior year. In addition, our pharmacy revenue growth has also been negatively affected by the mix of drugs sold, continued reimbursement pressure and the lack of significant new brand name drug introductions. 

Pharmacy revenue continued to benefit from the increased utilization by Medicare Part D beneficiaries, our ability to attract and retain managed care customers, the increased use of pharmaceuticals by an aging population and as the first line of defense for individual health care.   
       
  Gross profit   in our Retail/LTC Segment includes net revenues less the cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period and the related purchasing costs, warehousing costs, delivery costs and actual and estimated inventory losses. 
    
  Gross profit increased $1.7 billion, or   7.9%  , to approximately   $23.7 billion   in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to   29.3%   in year ended December 31, 2016, from 30.5% in 2015. Gross profit increased $715 million, or 3.4%, to approximately $22.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 30.5% in year ended December 31, 2015, from 31.4% in 2014.  
    
  The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily driven by the addition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target and LTC, as well as same store sales, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by a decline in pharmacy margins due to continued reimbursement pressure and the mix effect of lower margins from the acquisitions of the pharmacies and clinics of Target and LTC, partially offset by increased front store margins. Front store margins increased due to changes in the mix of products sold and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies. The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily driven by the addition of LTC, same store sales and new store sales, increased generic dispensing, as well as favorable purchasing economics, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure.

As you review our Retail/LTC Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information about the business: 

Front store revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 23.6%, 26.5% and 28.8%, respectively. On average, our gross profit on front store revenues is generally higher than our gross profit on pharmacy revenues. Pharmacy revenues as a percentage of total net revenues increased approximately 210, 220 and 120 basis points in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This was due to pharmacy revenues growing faster than front store revenues, largely driven by the acquisitions of the pharmacies and clinics of Target and LTC. The mix effect from a higher proportion of pharmacy sales had a negative effect on our overall gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This negative effect was partially offset by an increase in generic drugs dispensed, an improved front store gross margin rate, which includes efforts to rationalize promotional strategies. 

During 2016 and 2015, our front store gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased compared to the prior year. In both years, the increase reflects a change in the mix of products sold, including store brand products, as a result of our efforts to rationalize promotional strategies. The increase in 2015 was also partially due to the removal of tobacco products from our stores in late 2014. 

Our pharmacy gross profit rates have been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of our business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC Segment. In the event the reimbursement pressure accelerates, we may not be able to sustain our current rate of revenue growth and gross profit dollars could be adversely impacted. The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted our gross profit but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which we expect to continue, reduces the benefit we realize from brand to generic product conversions. 
        
  Operating expenses   in our Retail/LTC Segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses. 
    
  Operating expenses increased $1.6 billion, or 10.7% to   $16 billion  , or   20.3%   as a percentage of net revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $14.9 billion, or 20.6% as a percentage of net revenues, in the prior year. Operating expenses increased $347 million, or 2.4%, to $14.9 billion, or 20.6% as a percentage of net revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $14.5 billion, or 21.4% as a percentage of net revenues, in the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 improved primarily due to expense leverage from net revenue growth. The increase in operating expense dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the addition of the pharmacies and clinics within Target stores and LTC, including acquisition-related integration costs of   $235 million  , and incremental store operating costs associated with operating more stores. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, includes a gain from a legal settlement with certain credit card companies of $32 million and an asset impairment charge of $34 million in connection with planned store closures in 2017 related to our enterprise streamlining initiative. Additionally, in April 2016, the Retail/LTC Segment made a charitable contribution of $32 million to the CVS Foundation to fund future charitable giving. The CVS Foundation is a non-profit entity that focuses on health, education and community involvement programs. The charitable contribution was recorded as an operating expense in the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved primarily due to higher legal costs in the prior year and leverage gained from the addition of LTC net revenues. The increase in operating expense dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to the addition of LTC, including acquisition-related integration costs of $64 million, and incremental store operating costs associated with operating more stores. 

Corporate Segment 
    
  Operating expenses   decreased   $143 million  , or 13.8%, to   $894 million   in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses increased $241 million, or 30.3%, to $1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating expenses within the Corporate Segment include executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance related costs. The decrease in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to acquisition-related transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Omnicare that occurred in August 2015, and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target that occurred in December 2015. Acquisition-related integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were   $10 million  . The increase in operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to acquisition-related transaction and integration costs of   $156 million   associated with the acquisitions of Omnicare and pharmacies and clinics of Target, as well as a $90 million charge related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 settlement by MedPartners of various securities class actions and a related derivative claim.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to meet our cash needs in the short-term. Over the long-term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. We believe our operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, sale-leaseback program, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. 
    
  The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 

Net cash provided by operating activities   increased by   $1.7 billion   in 2016 and $275 million in 2015. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to the timing of payments for our Medicare Part D operations. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to increased net income partially offset by various changes in working capital.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities   decreased by   $11.0 billion   in 2016 and increased by $9.4 billion in 2015. The decrease in 2016 and increase in 2015 were primarily due to the $9.6 billion paid for the acquisition of Omnicare and the $1.9 billion paid for the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target in 2015, compared to the $2.1 billion paid for the Coram acquisition in 2014. 
    
  In 2016, gross capital expenditures totaled approximately   $2.2 billion  , a decrease of approximately   $143 million   compared to the prior year. During 2016, approximately 31% of our total capital expenditures were for new store construction, 20% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements and 49% were for technology and other corporate initiatives. Gross capital expenditures totaled approximately $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion during 2015 and 2014, respectively. During 2015, approximately 36% of our total capital expenditures were for new store construction, 21% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements and 43% were for technology and other corporate initiatives. 
    
  Proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions totaled   $230 million   in 2016. This compares to   $411 million   in 2015 and   $515 million   in 2014. Under the sale-leaseback transactions, the properties are generally sold at net book value, which generally approximates fair value, and the resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. The specific timing and amount of future sale-leaseback transactions will vary depending on future market conditions and other factors. 
    
  Below is a summary of our store development activity for the respective years: 

(1)         Relocated stores are not included in new or closed store totals.  
  (2)         Includes retail drugstores, certain onsite pharmacy stores, specialty pharmacy stores and pharmacies within Target stores. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities   was   $6.7 billion   in 2016 versus net cash provided by financing activities of   $5.0 billion   in 2015. The difference of   $11.7 billion   is primarily due to lower long-term borrowings and higher net repayments of short and long-term debt in 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.0 billion in 2015 versus net cash used in financing  
  
   11 

activities of $5.7 billion in 2014. The difference of $10.7 billion was primarily due to higher net borrowings in 2015, including the $14.8 billion in net proceeds received from the July 2015 debt issuance, partially offset by an increase in share repurchases in 2015 of $1.0 billion. 
    
  Share repurchase programs     The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2016 and 2014 Repurchase Programs may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.  
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective August 29, 2016, the Company entered into   two   fixed dollar ASRs with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ) for a total of   $3.6 billion  . Upon payment of the   $3.6 billion   purchase price on January 6, 2017, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $3.6 billion   notional amount of the ASRs or approximately   36.1 million   shares at a price of   $80.34   per share, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2017. At the conclusion of the ASRs, the Company may receive additional shares equal to the remaining   20%   of the   $3.6 billion   notional amount. The ultimate number of shares the Company may receive will fluctuate based on changes in the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock over a period beginning on January 6, 2017 and ending on or before July 6, 2017. If the mean daily volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock, less a discount (the  forward price ), during the ASRs falls below   $80.34   per share, the Company will receive a higher number of shares from Barclays. If the forward price rises above   $80.34   per share, the Company will either receive fewer shares from Barclays or, potentially have an obligation to Barclays which, at the Company's option, could be settled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASRs, the maximum number of shares that could be received or delivered is   90.1 million  . 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a   $725 million   fixed dollar ASR with Barclays. Upon payment of the   $725 million   purchase price on December 14, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR or approximately   6.2 million   shares. The initial   6.2 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in December 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of   $580 million   and a forward contract of   $145 million  . The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet. On January 28, 2016, the Company received   1.4 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   1.4 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in January 2016 and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2013 Repurchase Programs, effective January 2, 2015, the Company entered into a   $2.0 billion   fixed dollar ASR agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( JP Morgan ). Upon payment of the   $2.0 billion   purchase price on January 5, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately   16.8 million   shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2015. On May 1, 2015, the Company received approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   3.1 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by JP Morgan were placed into treasury stock in May 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of   $1.6 billion   and a forward contract of   $0.4 billion  . The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was initially recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet and was reclassified to treasury stock upon the settlement of the ASR in May 2015.  
    
  In the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude the ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.  
  
   12 

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased an aggregate of   47.5 million   shares of common stock for approximately   $4.5 billion   under the 2014 Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2016, there remained an aggregate of approximately   $18.2 billion   available for future repurchases under the 2016 and 2014 Repurchase Programs,   $3.6 billion   of which was used for the ASR effective January 6, 2017 described previously. As of December 31, 2015, the 2013 Repurchase Program was complete. 
    
  Short-term borrowings   - The Company had approximately   $1.9 billion   of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of   1.22%   as of December 31, 2016. In connection with its commercial paper program, the Company maintains a   $1.0 billion  ,   five  -year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on May 23, 2018, a   $1.25 billion  ,   five  -year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on July 24, 2019, and a   $1.25 billion  ,   five  -year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on July 1, 2020. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately   0.03%  , regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2016, there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the back-up credit facilities.  
    
  On January 3, 2017, the Company entered into a   $2.5 billion   revolving credit facility. The credit facility allows for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately   0.03%  , regardless of usage. The maximum available under the credit facility decreases by   $750 million   on both March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 and by   $500 million   on September 30, 2017. The credit facility expires on December 31, 2017.  
  On May 20, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Omnicare, the Company entered into a   $13 billion   unsecured bridge loan facility. The Company paid approximately   $52 million   in fees in connection with the facility. The fees were capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility was outstanding. The bridge loan facility expired on July 20, 2015 upon the Company s issuance of unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal of   $15 billion   as discussed below. The bridge loan facility fees became fully amortized in July 2015. 
    
  Long-term borrowings   - On May 16, 2016, the Company issued   $1.75 billion   aggregate principal amount of   2.125%   unsecured senior notes due June 1, 2021 and   $1.75 billion   aggregate principal amount of   2.875%   unsecured senior notes due June 1, 2026 (collectively, the  2016 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $3.5 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2016 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company's option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repay certain corporate debt. 
    
  On May 16, 2016, the Company announced tender offers for (1) any and all of its   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2017, its   6.60%   Senior Notes due 2019 and its   4.75%   Senior Notes due 2020 (collectively, the  Any and All Notes ) and (2) up to   $1.5 billion   aggregate principal amount of its   6.25%   Senior Notes due 2027, its   6.125%   Senior Notes due 2039, its   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2041, the   5.00%   Senior Notes due 2024 issued by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Omnicare, Inc.

On May 31, 2016, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the tender offers for the Maximum Tender Offer Notes to   $2.25 billion  . The Company purchased approximately   $835 million   aggregate principal amount of the Any and All Notes and   $2.25 billion   aggregate principal amount of the Maximum Tender Offer Notes pursuant to the tender offers, which expired on June 13, 2016. The Company paid a premium of   $486 million   in excess of the debt principal in connection with the purchase of the Notes, wrote off   $50 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred   $6 million   in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of   $542 million   which was recorded in income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.  
    
  On June 27, 2016, the Company notified the holders of the remaining Any and All Notes that the Company was exercising its option to redeem the outstanding Any and All Notes pursuant to the terms of the Any and All Notes and the Indenture dated as of August 15, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. Approximately   $1.1 billion   aggregate principal amount of Any and All Notes was redeemed on July 27, 2016. The Company paid a premium of   $97 million   in excess of the debt principal and wrote off   $4 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $101 million   during the year ended December 31, 2016.

On July 20, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of   $2.25 billion   of   1.9%     unsecured senior notes due 2018   ( 2018 Notes ), an aggregate of   $2.75 billion   of   2.8%     unsecured senior notes due 2020   ( 2020 Notes ), an aggregate of   $1.5 billion   of   3.5%     unsecured senior notes due 2022   ( 2022 Notes ), an aggregate of   $3 billion   of   3.875%     unsecured senior notes due 2025   ( 2025 Notes ), an aggregate of   $2 billion   of   4.875%     unsecured senior notes due 2035   ( 2035 Notes ), and an aggregate of   $3.5 billion   of   5.125%     unsecured senior notes due 2045   ( 2045 Notes  and, together with the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2035 Notes, the  Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $14.8 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The Notes pay interest semi-annually and contain redemption terms which allow or require the Company to redeem the Notes at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest at the redemption date. The net proceeds of the Notes were used to fund the Omnicare acquisition and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
    
  Upon the closing of the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015, the Company assumed the long-term debt of Omnicare that had a fair value of approximately   $3.1 billion  ,   $2.0 billion   of which was previously convertible into Omnicare shares that holders were able to redeem subsequent to the acquisition. During the period from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015, all but   $5 million   of the   $2.0 billion   of previously convertible debt was redeemed and repaid and approximately   $0.4 billion   in Omnicare term debt assumed was repaid for total repayments of Omnicare debt of approximately   $2.4 billion   in 2015.  
    
  The remaining principal of the Omnicare debt assumed was comprised of senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $700 million   (  $400 million   of   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and   $300 million   of   5% senior notes due 2024  ). In September 2015, the Company commenced exchange offers for the   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and the   5% senior notes due 2024   to exchange all validly tendered and accepted notes issued by Omnicare for notes to be issued by the Company. This offer expired on October 20, 2015 and the aggregate principal amounts of   $388 million   of the   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and   $296 million   of the   5% senior notes due 2024   were validly tendered and exchanged for notes issued by the Company. The Company recorded this exchange transaction as a modification of the original debt instruments. Consequently, no gain or loss on extinguishment was recognized in the Company's consolidated income statement as a result of this exchange transaction and the issuance costs of the new debt were expensed as incurred.   
    
  On August 7, 2014, the Company issued   $850 million   of   2.25%   unsecured senior notes due August 12, 2019 and   $650 million   of   3.375%   unsecured senior notes due August 12, 2024 (collectively, the  2014 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $1.5 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2014 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company s option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2014 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repay certain corporate debt. 
    
  On August 7, 2014, the Company announced tender offers for any and all of the   6.25%   Senior Notes due 2027, and up to a maximum amount of the   6.125%   Senior Notes due 2039, the   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2041 and the   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2017, for up to an aggregate principal amount of   $1.5 billion  . On August 21, 2014, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the tender offers to   $2.0 billion   and completed the repurchase for the maximum amount on September 4, 2014. The Company paid a premium of   $490 million   in excess of the debt principal in connection with the tender offers, wrote off   $26 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred   $5 million   in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of   $521 million  . The loss was recorded in income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased the remaining   $41 million   of outstanding Enhanced Capital Advantage Preferred Securities ( ECAPS ) at par. The fees and write-off of deferred issuance costs associated with the early extinguishment of the ECAPS were immaterial.   
    
  Our credit facilities and unsecured senior notes (see Note 5  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. 
    
  These covenants do not include a requirement for the acceleration of our debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in our credit rating. We do not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2016, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. 
    
  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no outstanding derivative financial instruments. 
    
  Debt Ratings   - As of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt was rated  Baa1  by Moody s with a stable outlook and  BBB+  by Standard   Poor s with a stable outlook, and our commercial paper program was rated  P-2  by Moody s and  A-2  by Standard   Poor s. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody s and Standard   Poor s considered, among  
  
   14 

other things, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information. Although we currently believe our long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, we cannot guarantee the future actions of Moody s and/or Standard   Poor s. Our debt ratings have a direct impact on our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. 
    
  Quarterly Cash Dividend Increase   - In December 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an 18% increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.50 per share effective in 2017. This increase equates to an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share. In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a 21% increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.425 per share. This increase equated to an annual dividend rate of $1.70 per share. In December 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a 27% increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.35 per share. This increase equated to an annual dividend rate of $1.40 per share.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  In connection with executing operating leases, we provide a guarantee of the lease payments. We also finance a portion of our new store development through sale-leaseback transactions, which involve selling stores to unrelated parties and then leasing the stores back under leases that generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. We do not have any retained or contingent interests in the stores, and we do not provide any guarantees, other than a guarantee of the lease payments, in connection with the transactions. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our operating leases are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Between 1991 and 1997, we sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob s Stores, Linens  n Things, Marshalls, Kay-Bee Toys, This End Up and Footstar. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the store s lease obligations. When the subsidiaries were disposed of, the Company s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser agreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries were to become insolvent and failed to make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy these obligations. 
    
  As of December 31, 2016, we guaranteed approximately   87   such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens  n Things), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through   2047  . Management believes the ultimate disposition of any of the remaining lease guarantees will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or future cash flows. Please see  Income (loss) from discontinued operations  previously in this document for further information regarding our guarantee of certain Linens  n Things  store lease obligations. 
    
  Below is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: 

(1) 
    The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target. See Note 6  Leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the lease arrangements with Target. Amounts related to the operating and capital leases with Target are reflected within the operating leases and capital lease obligations above. Amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic lives of the buildings are reflected herein assuming equivalent stores continue to operate through the term of the arrangements. 
              (2) 
    Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated on outstanding balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered, support the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. 
    
  Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies  to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  Our Pharmacy Services Segment sells prescription drugs directly through our mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through our retail pharmacy network. We recognize revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment from prescription drugs sold by our mail service dispensing pharmacies and under retail pharmacy network contracts where we are the principal using the gross method at the contract prices negotiated with our clients. Net revenue from our Pharmacy Services Segment includes: (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to us, net of any volume-related or other discounts paid back to the client, (ii) the price paid to us ( Mail Co-Payments ) or a third party pharmacy in our retail pharmacy network ( Retail Co-Payments ) by individuals included in our clients  benefit plans, and (iii) administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts where we are not the principal. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 
    
  We recognize revenue in the Pharmacy Services Segment when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Pharmacy Services Segment. 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription is delivered. At the time of delivery, the Pharmacy Services Segment has performed substantially all of its obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments. 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Pharmacy Services Segment s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Pharmacy Services Segment s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Pharmacy Services Segment s online claims processing system. 
       
  We determine whether we are the principal or agent for our retail pharmacy network transactions on a contract by contract basis. In the majority of our contracts, we have determined we are the principal due to us: (i) being the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) having latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) having discretion in supplier selection, (iv) having involvement in the determination of product or service specifications, and (v) having credit risk. Our obligations under our client contracts for which revenues are reported using the gross method are separate and distinct from our obligations to the third party pharmacies included in our retail pharmacy network contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, we are contractually required to pay the third party pharmacies in our retail pharmacy network for products sold, regardless of whether we are paid by our clients. Our responsibilities under these client contracts typically include validating eligibility and coverage levels, communicating the prescription price and the co-payments due to the third party retail pharmacy, identifying possible adverse drug interactions for the pharmacist to address with the physician prior to dispensing, suggesting clinically appropriate generic alternatives where appropriate and approving the prescription for dispensing. Although we do not have credit risk with respect to Retail Co-Payments or inventory risk related to retail network claims, we believe that all of the other indicators of gross revenue reporting are present. For contracts under which we act as an agent, we record revenues using the net method. 
    
  We deduct from our revenues the manufacturers  rebates that are earned by our clients based on their members  utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. We estimate these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and our estimates of the manufacturers  rebates earned by our clients. We base our estimates on the best available data at period-end and

recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. We adjust our rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. We record any cumulative effect of these adjustments against revenues as identified, and adjust our estimates prospectively to consider recurring matters. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with our clients or manufacturers, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates or whether the product was included in the applicable formulary. We also deduct from our revenues pricing guarantees and guarantees regarding the level of service we will provide to the client or member as well as other payments made to our clients. Because the inputs to most of these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility, the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual amounts have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. 
    
  We participate in the federal government s Medicare Part D program as a PDP through our SilverScript subsidiary. Our net revenues include insurance premiums earned by the PDP, which are determined based on the PDP s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with CMS. The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, but which is subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially deferred as accrued expenses and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits. 
    
  In addition to these premiums, our net revenues include co-payments, coverage gap benefits, deductibles and co-insurance (collectively, the  Member Co-Payments ) related to PDP members  actual prescription claims. In certain cases, CMS subsidizes a portion of these Member Co-Payments and we are paid an estimated prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy, each month. The prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amounts received from CMS are also included in our net revenues. We assume no risk for these amounts, which represented 5.9%, 6.3% and 6.4% of consolidated net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If the prospective Member Co-Payment subsidies received differ from the amounts based on actual prescription claims, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable or accrued expenses. We account for fully insured CMS obligations and Member Co-Payments (including the amounts subsidized by CMS) using the gross method consistent with our revenue recognition policies for Mail Co-Payments and Retail Co-Payments. We have recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from our participation in the Medicare Part D program based on information in our claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from our participation in the Medicare Part D program include: (i) estimates of low-income cost subsidy, reinsurance amounts and coverage gap discount amounts ultimately payable to or receivable from CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation, (ii) an estimate of amounts payable to CMS under a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor and (iii) estimates for claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported. Actual amounts of Medicare Part D-related assets and liabilities could differ significantly from amounts recorded. Historically, the effect of these adjustments has not been material to our results of operations or financial position. 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  Retail Pharmacy   - We recognize revenue from the sale of front store merchandise at the time the merchandise is purchased by the retail customer and recognize revenue from the sale of prescription drugs when the prescription is picked up by the customer. Customer returns are not material. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 
    
  Long-term Care   - We recognize revenue when products are delivered or services are rendered or provided to our customers, prices are fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A significant portion of our revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products are reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. Payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges. We monitor our revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as other third party insurance payors, and record an estimated contractual allowance for sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date, to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total net revenues and receivables reported in our consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Since billing functions for a portion of our revenue systems are largely computerized, enabling on-line adjudication at the time of sale to record net revenues, our exposure in connection with estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims (typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor). For the remaining portion of our revenue systems, the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed, unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims. We evaluate several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis, including historical trends based on actual claims paid, current contract and reimbursement terms, and changes in customer base and payor/product mix. Contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled, and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments was not significant to our results of operations. Further, we do not expect the impact of  
  
   18 

changes in estimates related to unsettled contractual allowance amounts from Medicare, Medicaid and third party payors as of December 31, 2016 to be significant to our future consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
    
  Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of our normal billing procedures and subject to our normal accounts receivable collections procedures. 
    
  Health Care Clinics   - for services provided by our health care clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates. 
    
  Loyalty Program   - our customer loyalty program, ExtraCare       , is comprised of two components, ExtraSavings   TM    and ExtraBucks        Rewards. ExtraSavings coupons redeemed by customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed. ExtraBucks Rewards are accrued as a charge to cost of revenues when earned, net of estimated breakage. We determine breakage based on our historical redemption patterns. 
    
  Allowances for Doubtful Accounts 
    
  Accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies, governmental agencies and long-term care facilities), clients, members and private pay customers, as well as vendors and manufacturers. We provide a reserve for accounts receivable considered to be at increased risk of becoming uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We establish this allowance for doubtful accounts and consider such factors as historical collection experience, (i.e., payment history and credit losses) and creditworthiness, specifically identified credit risks, aging of accounts receivable by payor category, current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors. We regularly review our allowance for doubtful accounts for appropriateness. Judgment is used to assess the collectability of account balances and the economic ability of a customer to pay. 
    
  Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2016 was   $286 million  , compared with $161 million as of December 31, 2015. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represented   2.3%   and 1.3% of gross receivables (net of contractual allowance adjustments) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unforeseen future developments could lead to changes in our provision for doubtful accounts levels and future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages. For example, a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables as of December 31, 2016 would result in an increase to the provision of doubtful accounts of approximately $126 million. 
    
  Given our experience, we believe that our aggregate reserves for potential losses are adequate, but if any of our larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations, our overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate. In particular, if economic conditions worsen, the payor mix shifts significantly or reimbursement rates are adversely affected, we may adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly, and our accounts receivable collections, cash flows, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
    
  Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  Our Pharmacy Services Segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services Segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the results of operations. We account for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Pharmacy Services Segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services Segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of  Cost of revenues . 

19 

Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  Vendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC Segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract. 
    
  We have not made any material changes in the way we account for vendor allowances and purchase discounts during the past three years. 
    
  Inventory 
    
  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method.  
    
  We reduce the value of our ending inventory for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are properly stated. The accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends. 
    
  Our total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $283 million as of December 31, 2016. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help you assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimated inventory losses, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our total reserve for estimated inventory losses by about $28 million as of December 31, 2016. 
    
  Although we believe that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. 
    
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, client contracts and relationships, favorable leases and covenants not to compete. These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. 
    
  Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation techniques and management estimates. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 
    
  We evaluate the recoverability of certain long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, but excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are tested for impairment using separate tests, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We group and evaluate these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. When evaluating these long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an  
  
   20 

impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group s carrying value that exceeds the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). Our long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate each asset group s future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, we consider historical results and current operating trends and our consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. 
    
  These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns. 
    
  Goodwill and indefinitely-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
    
  Indefinitely-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. 
    
  Our indefinitely-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the fair value based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as the profitability of the Company. 
    
  Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis using a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the reporting unit s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flow valuation model and comparable market transaction models. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
    
  The determination of the fair value of our reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include, but are not limited to, the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates, terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating profit, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, we consider each reporting unit s historical results and current operating trends and our consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results, forecasts and industry trends. Our estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, our market capitalization, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increase member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns. 
    
  The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets covered by this critical accounting policy was   $38.2 billion   and   $13.5 billion   as of December 31, 2016, respectively. We did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill or other intangible assets during 2016, 2015 or 2014. During the third quarter of 2016, we performed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitely-lived trademarks. The goodwill impairment tests resulted in the fair values of our Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins. The fair values of our LTC and RxCrossroads reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 7% and 12%, respectively. The balance of goodwill for our LTC and RxCrossroads reporting units at December 31, 2016 was approximately $6.4 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. 
    
  Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to test for impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment tests. 
    
  We have not made any material changes in the methodologies utilized to test the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment during the past three years. 

21 

Closed Store Lease Liability 
    
  We account for closed store lease termination costs when a leased store is closed. When a leased store is closed, we record a liability for the estimated present value of the remaining obligation under the noncancelable lease, which includes future real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other charges, if applicable. The liability is reduced by estimated future sublease income. 
    
  The initial calculation and subsequent evaluations of our closed store lease liability contain uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the timing and duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future lump sum settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential future sublease income. When estimating these potential termination costs and their related timing, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. 
    
  Our total closed store lease liability covered by this critical accounting policy was $183 million as of December 31, 2016. This amount is net of $98 million of estimated sublease income that is subject to the uncertainties discussed above. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for sublease income, it is possible that actual results could differ. 
    
  In order to help you assess the risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimated sublease income, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our total closed store lease liability by about $10 million as of December 31, 2016. 
    
  We have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology used to record closed store lease reserves during the past three years. 
    
  During the year ending December 31, 2017, we intend to close approximately 70 retail stores and expect to take a charge of approximately $225 million associated with the remaining lease obligations of such stores.  
  Self-Insurance Liabilities 
    
  We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability, although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure. We are also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. 
    
  The estimate of our self-insurance liability contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. When estimating our self-insurance liability, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical claim experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions. On a quarterly basis, we review our self-insurance liability to determine if it is adequate as it relates to our general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability. Similar reviews are conducted semi-annually to determine if our self-insurance liability is adequate for our health and medical liability. 
    
  Our total self-insurance liability covered by this critical accounting policy was $670 million as of December 31, 2016. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for our self-insurance liability, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help you assess the risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimate for our self-insurance liability, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our self-insurance liability by about $67 million as of December 31, 2016. 
    
  We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three years. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain. 
  
   22 

Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions. We have established accruals for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the Company s ability to record, process, summarize and report a system of internal accounting controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets are prevented or timely detected and that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and receipts and expenditures are duly authorized. In order to ensure the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. 
    
  We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in   Internal Control-Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation, evaluation of the design effectiveness and testing of the operating effectiveness of controls. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by our internal auditors, written policies and procedures and a written Code of Conduct adopted by our Company s Board of Directors, applicable to all employees of our Company. In addition, we have an internal Disclosure Committee, comprised of management from each functional area within the Company, which performs a separate review of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls over financial reporting. 
    
  Based on our assessment, we conclude our Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements as of December 31, 2016.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of CVS Health Corporation 
    
  We have audited CVS Health Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). CVS Health Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  In our opinion, CVS Health Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria. 
    
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of CVS Health Corporation and our report dated February 9, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1    Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Description of business   - CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) is the largest integrated pharmacy health care provider in the United States based upon revenues and prescriptions filled. The Company currently has   three   reportable business segments, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate, which are described below. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment (the  PSS )   - The PSS provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management services including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. The Company s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part D, Managed Medicaid plans, plans offered on the public and private exchanges, and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States.  
    
  As a pharmacy benefits manager, the PSS manages the dispensing of pharmaceuticals through the Company s mail order pharmacies and national network of more than   68,000   retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately   41,000   chain pharmacies and   27,000   independent pharmacies, to eligible members in the benefits plans maintained by the Company s clients and utilizes its information systems to perform, among other things, safety checks, drug interaction screenings and brand to generic substitutions. 
    
  The PSS  specialty pharmacies support individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies. The specialty pharmacy business includes mail order and retail specialty pharmacies that operate under the CVS Caremark       , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , Navarro        Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts ( ACS Pharmacy ) names. In January 2014, the Company enhanced its offerings of specialty infusion services and began offering enteral nutrition services through Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ). In August 2015, the Company further expanded its specialty offerings with the acquisition of ACS Pharmacy which was part of the Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ) acquisition. See Note 2  Acquisitions.   
    
  The PSS also provides health management programs, which include integrated disease management for   18   conditions, through the Company s Accordant        rare disease management offering. 
    
  In addition, through the Company s SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, the PSS is a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. 
    
  The PSS generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs to plan members. Prescription drugs are dispensed by the mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies and national network of retail pharmacies. Net revenues are also generated by providing additional services to clients, including administrative services such as claims processing and formulary management, as well as health care related services such as disease management. 
    
  The PSS operates under the CVS Caremark        Pharmacy Services, Caremark       , CVS Caremark   TM   , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , Accordant       , SilverScript       , Coram       , CVS Specialty   TM   , NovoLogix       , Navarro        Health Services and ACS Pharmacy names. As of December 31, 2016, the PSS operated   23   retail specialty pharmacy stores,   13   specialty mail order pharmacies and   four   mail order dispensing pharmacies, and   84   branches for infusion and enteral services, including   73   ambulatory infusion suites and   three   centers of excellence, located in   41   states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment (the  RLS )   - The RLS sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, personal care products, convenience foods, photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise, and greeting cards, through the Company s CVS Pharmacy       , CVS       , CVS Pharmacy y m s       , Longs Drugs       , Navarro Discount Pharmacy        and Drogaria Onofre   TM    retail stores and online through CVS.com       , Navarro.com and Onofre.com.br.  
    
  The RLS also provides health care services through its MinuteClinic        health care clinics. MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions and deliver vaccinations. 
    
  With the acquisition of Omnicare, the RLS now provides long-term care ( LTC ) operations, which is comprised of providing the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings, as well as commercialization services which are provided under the name RxCrossroads       . With the December

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

2015 acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation ( Target ), the Company added   1,672   pharmacies and approximately   79   clinics. 
    
  As of December 31, 2016, the retail pharmacy business included   9,709   retail stores (of which   7,980   were our stores that operated a pharmacy and   1,674   were our pharmacies located within a Target store) located in   49   states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy, CVS, CVS Pharmacy y m s       , Longs Drugs, Navarro Discount Pharmacy and Drogaria Onofre names, the online retail websites, CVS.com, Navarro.com and Onofre.com.br, and   1,139   retail health care clinics operating under the MinuteClinic name (of which   1,053   were located in our retail pharmacy stores,   79   were located in Target stores and   seven   were located in corporate campuses or other locations). LTC operations is comprised of   152   spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders and   32   hub pharmacies that use proprietary automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC operates primarily under the Omnicare        and NeighborCare        names. 
    
  Corporate Segment   - The Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of the Company s executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments. 
    
  Principles of consolidation   - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  The Company continually evaluates its investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a VIE. If the Company determines that it has a variable interest in a VIE, the Company then evaluates if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether the Company has the ability to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. 
    
  Assets and liabilities of VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company s consolidated financial statements. VIE creditors do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company. 
    
  Use of estimates   - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Fair value hierarchy   - The Company utilizes the three-level valuation hierarchy for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and liabilities within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy consist of the following: 

Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument. 

Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon management s best estimate of inputs market participants could use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk. 
       
  Cash and cash equivalents   - Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-term money market funds, commercial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. 
    
  Short-term investments   - The Company s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with initial maturities of greater than three months when purchased that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date. These investments, which were classified as available-for-sale within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, were carried at fair value, which approximated their historical cost at December 31, 2016 and 2015. 

35 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Fair value of financial instruments   - As of December 31, 2016, the Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, contingent consideration liability and short-term debt. Due to the nature of these instruments, the Company s carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of total long-term debt was   $25.7 billion   and   $26.5 billion  , respectively, as of December 31, 2016. The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was estimated based on quoted rates currently offered in active markets for the Company s debt, which is considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  Foreign currency translation and transactions   - For local currency functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
    
  For U.S. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for non-monetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income. 
    
  Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements were not material for all periods presented. 
    
  Accounts receivable   - Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The accounts receivable balance primarily includes amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies, governmental agencies and long-term care facilities), clients, members and private pay customers, as well as vendors and manufacturers. Charges to bad debt are based on both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. 
    
  The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for the years ended December 31 is as follows: 

Inventories   - Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and long-term care pharmacy and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical results and current trends. 
    
  Property and equipment   - Property, equipment and improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or when applicable, the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives generally range from   10   to   40   years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements and   3   to   10   years for fixtures, equipment and internally developed software. Repair and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Application development stage costs for significant internally developed software projects are capitalized and depreciated. 

36 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following are the components of property and equipment at December 31:  

The gross amount of property and equipment under capital leases was   $547 million   and   $528 million   as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accumulated amortization of property and equipment under capital lease was   $119 million   and   $97 million   as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of property and equipment under capital lease is included within depreciation expense. Depreciation expense totaled   $1.7 billion   in 2016,   $1.5 billion   in 2015 and   $1.4 billion   in 2014. 
    
  Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets   - Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment reviews annually, or more frequently if necessary. See Note 3  Goodwill and Other Intangibles  for additional information on goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets. 
    
  Intangible assets   - Purchased customer contracts and relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives between   9   and   20   years. Purchased customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to   10   years. Purchased leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the lease. See Note 3  Goodwill and Other Intangibles  for additional information about intangible assets. 
    
  Impairment of long-lived assets   - The Company groups and evaluates fixed and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group s carrying value that exceeds the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). 
    
  Redeemable noncontrolling interest   - As a result of the acquisition of Omnicare in August 2015, the Company obtained a   73%   ownership interest in limited liability company ( LLC ). Due to the change in control in Omnicare, the noncontrolling member of the LLC had the contractual right to put its membership interest to the Company at fair value. Consequently, the noncontrolling interest in the LLC was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at fair value. During 2016, the noncontrolling shareholder of the LLC exercised its option to sell its ownership interest and the Company purchased the noncontrolling interest in the LLC for approximately   $39 million  . 
    
  Below is a summary of the changes in redeemable noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31:

Revenue Recognition 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  The PSS sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through its retail pharmacy network. The PSS recognizes revenue from prescription drugs sold by its mail service dispensing pharmacies and under retail pharmacy network contracts where it is the principal using the gross method at the contract prices negotiated with its clients. Net revenues include: (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the PSS, net of any volume-related or other discounts paid back to the client (see  Drug Discounts  below), (ii) the price paid to the PSS by client plan members for mail order prescriptions ( Mail Co-Payments ) and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions ( Retail Co-Payments ), and (iii) administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts where the PSS is not the principal as discussed below. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 
    
  Revenue is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the PSS: 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription is delivered. At the time of delivery, the PSS has performed substantially all of its obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments. 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the PSS  retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the PSS  point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the PSS online claims processing system. 
       
  The PSS determines whether it is the principal or agent for its retail pharmacy network transactions on a contract by contract basis. In the majority of its contracts, the PSS has determined it is the principal due to it: (i) being the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) having latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) having discretion in supplier selection, (iv) having involvement in the determination of product or service specifications, and (v) having credit risk. The PSS  obligations under its client contracts for which revenues are reported using the gross method are separate and distinct from its obligations to the third party pharmacies included in its retail pharmacy network contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, the PSS is contractually required to pay the third party pharmacies in its retail pharmacy network for products sold, regardless of whether the PSS is paid by its clients. The PSS  responsibilities under its client contracts typically include validating eligibility and coverage levels, communicating the prescription price and the co-payments due to the third party retail pharmacy, identifying possible adverse drug interactions for the pharmacist to address with the prescriber prior to dispensing, suggesting generic alternatives where clinically appropriate and approving the prescription for dispensing. Although the PSS does not have credit risk with respect to Retail Co-Payments or inventory risk related to retail network claims, management believes that all of the other applicable indicators of gross revenue reporting are present. For contracts under which the PSS acts as an agent, revenue is recognized using the net method. 
    
  Drug Discounts   - The PSS deducts from its revenues any rebates, inclusive of discounts and fees, earned by its clients. Rebates are paid to clients in accordance with the terms of client contracts, which are normally based on fixed rebates per prescription for specific products dispensed or a percentage of manufacturer discounts received for specific products dispensed. The liability for rebates due to clients is included in  Claims and discounts payable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Medicare Part D   - The PSS, through its SilverScript subsidiary, participates in the federal government s Medicare Part D program as a Prescription Drug Plan ( PDP ). Net revenues include insurance premiums earned by the PDP, which are determined based on the PDP s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). The insurance premiums include a direct premium paid by CMS and a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, but which is subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members. Premiums collected in advance are initially deferred in accrued expenses and are then recognized in net revenues over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits. 
    
  In addition to these premiums, net revenues include co-payments, coverage gap benefits, deductibles and co-insurance (collectively, the  Member Co-Payments ) related to PDP members  actual prescription claims. In certain cases, CMS subsidizes a portion of these Member Co-Payments and pays the PSS an estimated prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amount each month. The prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amounts received from CMS are also included in net revenues. SilverScript assumes no risk for these amounts. If the prospective Member Co-Payment subsidies received differ  
  
   38 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

from the amounts based on actual prescription claims, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable or accrued expenses. 
    
  The PSS accounts for CMS obligations and Member Co-Payments (including the amounts subsidized by CMS) using the gross method consistent with its revenue recognition policies for Mail Co-Payments and Retail Co-Payments (discussed previously in this document). 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment    
    
  Retail Pharmacy   - The retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Customer returns are not material. Revenue generated from the performance of services in the RLS  health care clinics is recognized at the time the services are performed. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 
    
  Long-term Care   - Revenue is recognized when products are delivered or services are rendered or provided to the customer, prices are fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A significant portion of the revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products are reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. Payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as other third party insurance payors, and record an estimated contractual allowance for sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date, to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total net sales and receivables reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Since billing functions for a portion of the Company's revenue systems are largely computerized, enabling on-line adjudication at the time of sale to record net revenues, the Company's exposure in connection with estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims (typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor). For the remaining portion of the Company's revenue systems, the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed, unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims. The Company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis, including historical trends based on actual claims paid, current contract and reimbursement terms, and changes in customer base and payor/product mix. Contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled, and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments was not significant to our results of operations for any of the periods presented.  
    
  Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of our normal billing procedures and subject to our normal accounts receivable collections procedures. 
    
  Health Care Clinics   - For services provided by our health care clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates. 
    
  Loyalty Program   - The Company s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare       , is comprised of   two   components, ExtraSavings   TM    and ExtraBucks        Rewards. ExtraSavings coupons redeemed by customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed. ExtraBucks Rewards are accrued as a charge to cost of revenues when earned, net of estimated breakage. The Company determines breakage based on historical redemption patterns. 
    
  See Note 12  Segment Reporting  for additional information about the revenues of the Company s business segments. 
    
  Cost of revenues 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment   - The PSS  cost of revenues includes: (i) the cost of prescription drugs sold during the reporting period directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through its retail pharmacy network, (ii) shipping and handling costs, and (iii) the operating costs of its mail service dispensing pharmacies and client service operations and related information technology support costs including depreciation and amortization. The cost of prescription drugs sold component of cost of revenues includes: (i) the cost of the prescription drugs purchased from manufacturers or distributors and shipped to members in clients  benefit plans from the PSS  mail service dispensing pharmacies, net of any volume-related or other discounts (see  Vendor allowances and purchase discounts  below) and (ii) the cost of prescription drugs sold (including Retail Co-Payments) through the PSS  retail pharmacy network under contracts where it is the principal, net of any volume-related or other discounts. 

39 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Retail/LTC Segment   - The RLS  cost of revenues includes: the cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period and the related purchasing costs, warehousing and delivery costs (including depreciation and amortization) and actual and estimated inventory losses.  
    
  See Note 12  Segment Reporting  for additional information about the cost of revenues of the Company s business segments. 
    
  Vendor allowances and purchase discounts 
    
  The Company accounts for vendor allowances and purchase discounts as follows: 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment   - The PSS receives purchase discounts on products purchased. The PSS  contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the PSS to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices, or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within   30   days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the PSS  results of operations. The PSS accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The PSS also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined annual purchase volumes. In addition, the PSS receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of  Cost of revenues . 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment   - Vendor allowances received by the RLS reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract. The total amortization of these upfront payments was not material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Insurance   - The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability. The Company obtains third party insurance coverage to limit exposure from these claims. The Company is also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. The Company s self-insurance accruals, which include reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, are calculated using standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions and the Company s historical claims experience. 
    
  Facility opening and closing costs   - New facility opening costs, other than capital expenditures, are charged directly to expense when incurred. When the Company closes a facility, the present value of estimated unrecoverable costs, including the remaining lease obligation less estimated sublease income and the book value of abandoned property and equipment, are charged to expense. The long-term portion of the lease obligations associated with facility closings was   $181 million   and   $217 million   in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Advertising costs   - Advertising costs are expensed when the related advertising takes place. Advertising costs, net of vendor funding (included in operating expenses), were   $216 million  ,   $221 million   and   $212 million   in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
    
  Interest expense, net   - The following are the components of net interest expense for the years ended December 31: 

40 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Capitalized interest totaled   $13 million  ,   $12 million   and   $19 million   in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   
    
  Shares held in trust   - The Company maintains grantor trusts, which held approximately   one million   shares of its common stock at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These shares are designated for use under various employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted shares outstanding. 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive income   - Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of changes in the net actuarial gains and losses associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans, losses on derivatives from cash flow hedges executed in previous years associated with the issuance of long-term debt, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Company s pension and postretirement plans was   $284 million   pre-tax (  $173 million   after-tax) as of December 31, 2016 and   $305 million   pre-tax (  $186 million   after-tax) as of December 31, 2015. The net impact on cash flow hedges totaled   $9 million   pre-tax (  $5 million   after-tax) and   $14 million   pre-tax (  $7 million   after-tax) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were   $127 million   and   $165 million  , respectively. 
    
  Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component are shown below: 

(1) 
    All amounts are net of tax.  
              (2) 
    The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income for cash flow hedges are recorded within interest expense, net on the consolidated statement of income. The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income for pension and other postretirement benefits are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of income. 
       
  Stock-based compensation   - Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable requisite service period of the stock award (generally   3   to   5   years) using the straight-line method. 
    
  Variable interest entity   - In July 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ( Cardinal ) established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ( Red Oak ), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own   50%  . The Red Oak arrangement has an initial term of   ten years  . Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak by either company and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. 
  
   41 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity because it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within the Retail/LTC Segment.  
    
  Cardinal is required to pay the Company   39   quarterly payments beginning in October 2014. As milestones are met, the quarterly payments increase. The Company received approximately   $163 million  ,   $122 million   and   $26 million   from Cardinal during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The payments reduce the Company s carrying value of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold. Revenues associated with Red Oak expenses reimbursed by Cardinal for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as well as amounts due to or due from Cardinal at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were immaterial. 
    
  Related party transactions   - The Company has an equity method investment in SureScripts, LLC ( SureScripts ), which operates a clinical health information network. The Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments utilize this clinical health information network in providing services to its client plan members and retail customers. The Company expensed fees of approximately   $39 million   in the year ended December 31, 2016, and   $50 million   in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, for the use of this network. The Company s investment in and equity in earnings of SureScripts for all periods presented is immaterial. 
    
  The Company has an equity method investment in Heartland Healthcare Services ( Heartland ). Heartland operates several long-term care pharmacies in   four   states. Heartland paid the Company approximately   $140 million   and   $25 million   for pharmaceutical inventory purchases during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the Company performs certain collection functions for Heartland and then passes those customer cash collections to Heartland. The Company s investment in and equity in earnings of Heartland as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is immaterial.  
    
  In 2016 and 2014, the Company made charitable contributions of   $32 million   and   $25 million  , respectively, to the CVS Foundation (the  Foundation ) to fund future giving. The Foundation is a non-profit entity managed by employees of the Company that focuses on health, education and community involvement programs. The charitable contributions were recorded as operating expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014. 
    
  Income taxes   - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year or years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in the tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
    
  The Company recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. To the extent that the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.  
    
  The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 
    
  Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. 
    
  Discontinued operations   - In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Bob's Stores and Linens  n Things which filed for bankruptcy in 2016 and 2008, respectively. The Company's loss from discontinued operations in 2016 and 2014 includes lease-related costs which the Company believes it will likely be required to satisfy pursuant to its lease guarantees. The Company's income from discontinued operations in 2015 of   $9 million  , net of tax, was related to the release of certain store lease guarantees due to a settlement with a landlord. 

42 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Below is a summary of the results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31: 

Earnings per common share   - Earnings per share is computed using the two-class method. Options to purchase   6.7 million  ,   2.7 million   and   2.1 million   shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the options  exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. 
    
  New accounting pronouncements   - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net)  ,  which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and in April 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ,  which amends the guidance in those areas in the new revenue recognition standard. Both ASU's were issued in response to feedback received from the FASB-International Accounting Standards Board joint revenue recognition transition resource group. This new standard could impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized. The new revenue standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption of the standard in 2017 is permitted; however, the Company does not intend to early adopt the new standard. Companies have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the guidance. The Company formed a project team to assess and implement the new standard. While the Company is continuing to assess all of the potential impacts of the new standard including the potential impact from recent acquisitions, the Company does not expect the implementation of the standard will have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company intends to adopt the new standard on a modified retrospective basis.  
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory  , which amends ASU Topic 330. This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at  the lower of cost and net realizable value  rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. Upon transition, entities must disclose the accounting change. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Income Taxes   (Topic 740). The new guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The updated standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017 with early application permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. The Company elected to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2016 and has, accordingly, reclassified the current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities for all periods presented. The following is a reconciliation of the effect of the reclassification on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  :   

  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842). Lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such  
  
   43 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, a dual model was retained, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model (e.g., certain definitions, such as initial direct costs, have been updated) and the new revenue recognition standard. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company believes that the new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of this standard will have on the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which amends Accounting Standard Codification Topic 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  , in three areas. (1) The new guidance eliminates accounting for tax benefits and deficiencies through equity to the extent of previous windfalls, and then to the income statement. The new requirement is to record all tax benefits and deficiencies through the income statement. This amendment is required to be applied prospectively. The amendment also requires the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statements of cash flows as operating activities, a change which may be applied prospectively or retrospectively at the election of the Company. The amendment requires the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes as financing activities, a change which must be applied retrospectively. (2) The new guidance also permits companies to withhold an amount up to the employees' maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction without resulting in liability classification of the award. (3) Finally, the new guidance provides companies with an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated, as required today, or recognized when they occur. If elected, the change to recognize forfeitures when they occur needs to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   ASU 2016-15 is intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and to eliminate the diversity in practice related to such classifications. The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect on its consolidated statement of cash flows of adopting this new accounting guidance. 
    
  In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,   Statement of Cash Flows  , which amends ASU Topic 230. This ASU requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer be required to present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. When cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires a reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related captions in the balance sheet. Entities will also have to disclose the nature of their restricted cash and restricted cash equivalent balances. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to apply the guidance retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. 

2    Acquisitions 
    
  Omnicare Acquisition 
    
  On   August 18, 2015  , the Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding common shares and voting interests of Omnicare, for   $98   per share for a total of   $9.6 billion   and assumed long-term debt with a fair value of approximately   $3.1 billion  . Omnicare is a leading health care services company that specializes in the management of complex pharmaceutical care. Omnicare s long-term care ( LTC ) business is the nation s largest provider of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. In addition, Omnicare has a specialty pharmacy business operating primarily under the name of ACS Pharmacy, and provides commercialization services under the name of RxCrossroads       . The Company includes LTC and the commercialization services business in the Retail/LTC Segment, and includes the specialty pharmacy business in its Pharmacy Services Segment. The Company acquired Omnicare to expand its operations in dispensing prescription drugs to assisted-living and long-term care facilities, and to broaden its presence in the specialty pharmacy business as the Company seeks to serve a greater percentage of the growing senior patient population in the United States. 

44 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: 

The goodwill represents future economic benefits expected to arise from the Company s expanded presence in the pharmaceutical care market, the assembled workforce acquired, expected purchasing and revenue synergies, as well as operating efficiencies and cost savings. Goodwill of   $8.7 billion   was allocated to the Retail/LTC Segment and the remaining goodwill of   $0.4 billion   was allocated to the Pharmacy Services Segment. Approximately   $0.4 billion   of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets acquired include customer relationships and trade names of   $3.9 billion   and   $74 million  , respectively, with estimated weighted average useful lives of   19.1   and   2.9   years, respectively, and   18.8   years in total. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred transaction costs of   $70 million   associated with the acquisition of Omnicare that were recorded within operating expenses. 
    
  The Company s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, include   $2.6 billion   of net revenues and net income of   $61 million   associated with the operating results of Omnicare from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015. These Omnicare operating results include severance costs and accelerated stock-based compensation. 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of the Company s combined results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as if the Omnicare acquisition and the related financing transactions had occurred on January 1, 2014. The following pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as they would have been had the transactions been effected on the assumed date, nor is it necessarily an indication of trends in future results for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the pro forma information, basic shares outstanding and dilutive equivalents, cost savings from operating efficiencies, potential synergies, and the impact of incremental costs incurred in integrating the businesses. 

Pro forma income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, excludes   $135 million   related to severance costs, accelerated stock-based compensation and transaction costs incurred in connection with the Omnicare acquisition. Pro forma income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, includes a   $521 million   loss on the early extinguishment of debt recorded by CVS Health.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Target Pharmacy Acquisition 
    
  On   December 16, 2015  , the Company acquired the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target for approximately   $1.9 billion  , plus contingent consideration of up to   $60 million   based on future prescription growth over a   three   year period. The Company acquired Target s   1,672   pharmacies which operate in   47   states and will operate them through a store-within-a-store format, branded as CVS Pharmacy. The Company also acquired   79   Target clinic locations which were rebranded as MinuteClinic. The Company acquired the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses primarily to expand the geographic reach of its retail pharmacy business. 
    
  The fair values of the assets acquired at the date of acquisition were approximately as follows: 

Intangible assets acquired include customer relationships with an estimated useful life of   13   years. The goodwill represents future economic benefits expected to arise from the Company s expanded geographic presence in the retail pharmacy market, the assembled workforce acquired, expected purchasing and revenue synergies, as well as operating efficiencies and cost savings. The goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.   No   liability for any potential contingent consideration has been recorded based on current projections for future prescription growth over the relevant period.  
    
  In connection with the closing of the transaction, the Company and Target entered into pharmacy and clinic operating and master lease agreements. See Note 6  Leases  of the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of the Company s leasing arrangements. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred transaction costs of approximately   $26 million   associated with the acquisition that were recorded within operating expenses. The results of the Target pharmacies and clinics are included in the Company s Retail/LTC Segment beginning on   December 16, 2015  . Pro forma financial information for this acquisition is not presented as such results are immaterial to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

3    Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
    
  Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. 
    
  When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company first compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and a comparable market transaction model. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of its goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company performed its required annual goodwill impairment tests. The Company concluded there were   no   goodwill impairments as of the testing date.  

46 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Below is a summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: 

(1)  Other  represents immaterial purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions. 
    
  Indefinitely-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinitely-lived trademark using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company performed its annual impairment test of the indefinitely-lived trademark and concluded there was   no   impairment as of the testing date. The carrying amount of its indefinitely-lived trademark was   $6.4 billion   as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which have a weighted average useful life of   15.5   years. The weighted average useful life of the Company s customer contracts and relationships and covenants not to compete is   15.5   years. The weighted average life of the Company s favorable leases and other intangible assets is   15.9   years. Amortization expense for intangible assets totaled   $795 million  ,   $611 million   and   $518 million   in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The anticipated annual amortization expense for these intangible assets for the next five years is as follows: 

The following table is a summary of the Company s intangible assets as of December 31:

4    Share Repurchase Programs 
    
  The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2016 and 2014 Repurchase Programs may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.  
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective August 29, 2016, the Company entered into   two   fixed dollar ASRs with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ) for a total of   $3.6 billion  . Upon payment of the   $3.6 billion   purchase price on January 6, 2017, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $3.6 billion   notional amount of the ASRs or approximately   36.1 million   shares at a price of   $80.34   per share, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2017. At the conclusion of the ASRs, the Company may receive additional shares equal to the remaining   20%   of the   $3.6 billion   notional amount. The ultimate number of shares the Company may receive will fluctuate based on changes in the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock over a period beginning on January 6, 2017 and ending on or before July 6, 2017. If the mean daily volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock, less a discount (the  forward price ), during the ASRs falls below   $80.34   per share, the Company will receive a higher number of shares from Barclays. If the forward price rises above   $80.34   per share, the Company will either receive fewer shares from Barclays or, potentially have an obligation to Barclays which, at the Company's option, could be settled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASRs, the maximum number of shares that could be received or delivered is   90.1 million  . 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a   $725 million   fixed dollar ASR with Barclays. Upon payment of the   $725 million   purchase price on December 14, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR or approximately   6.2 million   shares. The initial   6.2 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in December 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of   $580 million   and a forward contract of   $145 million  . The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet. On January 28, 2016, the Company received   1.4 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   1.4 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in January 2016 and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2013 Repurchase Programs, effective January 2, 2015, the Company entered into a   $2.0 billion   fixed dollar ASR agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( JP Morgan ). Upon payment of the   $2.0 billion   purchase price on January 5, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately   16.8 million   shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2015. On May 1, 2015, the Company received approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   3.1 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by JP Morgan were placed into treasury stock in May 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of   $1.6 billion   and a forward contract of   $0.4 billion  . The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was initially recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet and was reclassified to treasury stock upon the settlement of the ASR in May 2015.  
    
  In the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude the ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.  

48

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

On January 3, 2017, the Company entered into a   $2.5 billion   revolving credit facility. The credit facility allows for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately   0.03%  , regardless of usage. The maximum available under the credit facility decreases by   $750 million   on both March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 and by   $500 million   on September 30, 2017. The credit facility expires on December 31, 2017.  
  On May 16, 2016, the Company issued   $1.75 billion   aggregate principal amount of   2.125%   unsecured senior notes due June 1, 2021 and   $1.75 billion   aggregate principal amount of   2.875%   unsecured senior notes due June 1, 2026 (collectively, the  2016 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $3.5 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2016 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company's option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repay certain corporate debt. 
    
  On May 16, 2016, the Company announced tender offers for (1) any and all of its   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2017, its   6.60%   Senior Notes due 2019 and its   4.75%   Senior Notes due 2020 (collectively, the  Any and All Notes ) and (2) up to   $1.5 billion   aggregate principal amount of its   6.25%   Senior Notes due 2027, its   6.125%   Senior Notes due 2039, its   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2041, the   5.00%   Senior Notes due 2024 issued by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ), the   4.75%   Senior Notes due 2022 issued by Omnicare, its   4.875%   Senior Notes due 2035 and its   3.875%   Senior Notes due 2025 (collectively, the  Maximum Tender Offer Notes  and together with the Any and All Notes, the  Notes ). On May 31, 2016, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the tender offers for the Maximum Tender Offer Notes to   $2.25 billion  . The Company purchased approximately   $835 million   aggregate principal amount of the Any and All Notes and   $2.25 billion   aggregate principal amount of the Maximum Tender Offer Notes pursuant to the tender offers, which expired on June 13, 2016. The Company paid a premium of   $486 million   in excess of the debt principal in connection with the purchase of the Notes, wrote off   $50 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred   $6 million   in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of   $542 million   which was recorded in income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.  
    
  On June 27, 2016, the Company notified the holders of the remaining Any and All Notes that the Company was exercising its option to redeem the outstanding Any and All Notes pursuant to the terms of the Any and All Notes and the Indenture dated as of August 15, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. Approximately   $1.1 billion   aggregate principal amount of Any and All Notes was redeemed on July 27, 2016. The Company paid a premium of   $97 million   in excess of the debt principal and wrote off   $4 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $101 million   during the year ended December 31, 2016. 
    
  The Company recorded a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of   $643 million   which was recorded in the income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
    
  On May 20, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Omnicare, the Company entered into a   $13 billion   unsecured bridge loan facility. The Company paid approximately   $52 million   in fees in connection with the facility. The fees were capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility was outstanding. The bridge loan facility expired on July 20, 2015 upon the Company s issuance of unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal of   $15 billion   as discussed below. The bridge loan facility fees became fully amortized in July 2015. 
    
  On July 20, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of   $2.25 billion   of   1.9%     unsecured senior notes due 2018   ( 2018 Notes ), an aggregate of   $2.75 billion   of   2.8%     unsecured senior notes due 2020   ( 2020 Notes ), an aggregate of   $1.5 billion   of   3.5%     unsecured senior notes due 2022   ( 2022 Notes ), an aggregate of   $3 billion   of   3.875%     unsecured senior notes due 2025   ( 2025 Notes ), an aggregate of   $2 billion   of   4.875%     unsecured senior notes due 2035   ( 2035 Notes ), and an aggregate of   $3.5 billion   of   5.125%     unsecured senior notes due 2045   ( 2045 Notes  and, together with the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2035 Notes, the  Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $14.8 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The Notes pay interest semi-annually and contain redemption terms which allow or require the Company to redeem the Notes at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest at the redemption date. The net proceeds of the Notes were used to fund the Omnicare acquisition and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
    
  Upon the closing of the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015, the Company assumed the long-term debt of Omnicare that had a fair value of approximately   $3.1 billion  ,   $2.0 billion   of which was previously convertible into Omnicare shares that holders were able to redeem subsequent to the acquisition. During the period from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015, all but   $5  
  
   51 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

million   of the   $2.0 billion   of previously convertible debt was redeemed and repaid and approximately   $0.4 billion   in Omnicare term debt assumed was repaid for total repayments of Omnicare debt of approximately   $2.4 billion   in 2015.  
    
  The remaining principal of the Omnicare debt assumed was comprised of senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $700 million   (  $400 million   of   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and   $300 million   of   5% senior notes due 2024  ). In September 2015, the Company commenced exchange offers for the   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and the   5% senior notes due 2024   to exchange all validly tendered and accepted notes issued by Omnicare for notes to be issued by the Company. This offer expired on October 20, 2015 and the aggregate principal amounts of   $388 million   of the   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and   $296 million   of the   5% senior notes due 2024   were validly tendered and exchanged for notes issued by the Company. The Company recorded this exchange transaction as a modification of the original debt instruments. Consequently, no gain or loss on extinguishment was recognized in the Company's consolidated income statement as a result of this exchange transaction and the issuance costs of the new debt were expensed as incurred.  
    
  On August 7, 2014, the Company issued   $850 million   of   2.25%   unsecured senior notes due August 12, 2019 and   $650 million   of   3.375%   unsecured senior notes due August 12, 2024 (collectively, the  2014 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $1.5 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2014 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company s option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2014 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repay certain corporate debt. 
    
  On August 7, 2014, the Company announced tender offers for any and all of the   6.25%   Senior Notes due 2027, and up to a maximum amount of the   6.125%   Senior Notes due 2039, the   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2041 and the   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2017, for up to an aggregate principal amount of   $1.5 billion  . On August 21, 2014, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the tender offers to   $2.0 billion   and completed the repurchase for the maximum amount on September 4, 2014. The Company paid a premium of   $490 million   in excess of the debt principal in connection with the tender offers, wrote off   $26 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred   $5 million   in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of   $521 million  . The loss was recorded in income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased the remaining   $41 million   of outstanding Enhanced Capital Advantage Preferred Securities ( ECAPS ) at par. The fees and write-off of deferred issuance costs associated with the early extinguishment of the ECAPS were immaterial.   
    
  The credit facilities, back-up credit facilities and unsecured senior notes contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. The covenants do not materially affect the Company s financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2016, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. 
    
  The following is a summary of the Company's required principal debt repayments, excluding unamortized debt discounts, deferred financing costs and debt premiums, due during each of the next five years and thereafter, as of December 31, 2016:  

6    Leases 
    
  The Company leases most of its retail and mail order locations,   11   of its distribution centers and certain corporate offices under noncancelable operating leases, typically with initial terms of   15   to   25   years and with options that permit renewals for additional periods. The Company also leases certain equipment and other assets under noncancelable operating leases, typically with initial terms of   3   to   10   years. In December 2015, in connection with the acquisition of the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target, the Company entered into lease agreements with Target for the pharmacy and clinic space within Target stores. Given  
  
   52 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

that the noncancelable contractual term of the pharmacy lease arrangement exceeds the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings being leased, the Company concluded for accounting purposes that the lease term was the remaining economic life of the buildings. Consequently, most of the individual pharmacy leases are capital leases. Approximately   $0.3 billion   of capital lease obligations were recorded in connection with this transaction. 
    
  Minimum rent on operating leases is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition to minimum rental payments, certain leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed when incurred. 
    
  The following table is a summary of the Company s net rental expense for operating leases for the years ended December 31:   

The following table is a summary of the future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases as of December 31, 2016:  

(1) 
    Future operating lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of   $176 million   due in the future under noncancelable subleases. 
              (2) 
    The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target. Amounts related to such capital and operating leases are reflected above. Amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings of approximately   $1.7 billion   are not reflected herein since the estimated economic life of the buildings is shorter than the contractual term of the lease arrangement. 
       
  The Company finances a portion of its store development program through sale-leaseback transactions. The properties are generally sold at net book value, which generally approximates fair value, and the resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. The operating leases that resulted from these transactions are included in the above table. The Company does not have any retained or contingent interests in the stores and does not provide any guarantees, other than a guarantee of lease payments, in connection with the sale-leaseback transactions. Proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions totaled   $230 million   in 2016,   $411 million   in 2015 and   $515 million   in 2014. 

7    Medicare Part D 
    
  The Company offers Medicare Part D benefits through SilverScript, which has contracted with CMS to be a PDP and, pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, must be a risk-bearing entity regulated under state insurance laws or similar statutes. 
    
  SilverScript is a licensed domestic insurance company under the applicable laws and regulations. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, SilverScript must file quarterly and annual reports with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) and certain state regulators, must maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus under a formula established by the NAIC and must, in certain circumstances, request and receive the approval of certain state regulators before making dividend payments or other capital distributions to the Company. The Company does not believe these limitations on dividends and distributions materially impact its financial position. 
  
   53 

The Company has recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from its participation in the Medicare Part D program based on information in its claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from its participation in this program include: (i) estimates of low-income cost subsidy, reinsurance amounts, and coverage gap discount amounts ultimately payable to or receivable from CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation that will occur in the following year; (ii) an estimate of amounts receivable from or payable to CMS under a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor and (iii) estimates for claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported.  

8    Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits 
    
  Defined Contribution Plans 
    
  The Company sponsors voluntary 401(k) savings plans that cover all employees who meet plan eligibility requirements. The Company makes matching contributions consistent with the provisions of the plans. 
    
  At the participant s option, account balances, including the Company s matching contribution, can be transferred without restriction among various investment options, including the Company s common stock fund under one of the defined contribution plans. The Company also maintains a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key employees. This plan provides participants the opportunity to defer portions of their eligible compensation and receive matching contributions equivalent to what they could have received under the CVS Health 401(k) Plan absent certain restrictions and limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company s contributions under the above defined contribution plans were   $295 million  ,   $251 million   and   $238 million   in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
    
  Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
    
  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company sponsored   seven   defined benefit pension plans.   Two   of the plans are tax-qualified plans that are funded based on actuarial calculations and applicable federal laws and regulations. The other   five   plans are unfunded nonqualified supplemental retirement plans. As of December 31, 2014, the Company sponsored   nine   defined benefit pension plans.   Four   of the plans were tax-qualified plans and the other   five   plans were unfunded nonqualified supplemental retirement plans. Most of the plans were frozen in prior periods.  
    
  On September 30, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved a resolution to merge the   four   tax-qualified defined benefit plans that existed in 2014 and terminate the resulting merged plan. The merger was effective September 30, 2015 and the merged plan termination was effective December 31, 2015. The settlement of the terminated plan is expected to occur around the third quarter of 2017. The pension liability for the terminated plan will be settled in either lump sum payments or purchased annuities. Since the amount of the settlement depends on a number of factors determined as of the liquidation date, including the annuity pricing interest rate environment, lump sum election rates, and asset experience, the Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate cost of the settlement. However, based on current market rates the one-time settlement charge at final liquidation is estimated to be in the range of approximately   $175 million   to   $225 million  . 
    
  The following tables outline the change in benefit obligations and plan assets over the comparable periods: 

54 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The components of net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31 are shown below:  

Pension Plan Assumptions 
    
  The Company uses a series of actuarial assumptions to determine the benefit obligations and the net benefit costs. The discount rate is determined by examining the current yields observed on the measurement date of fixed-interest, high quality investments expected to be available during the period to maturity of the related benefits on a plan by plan basis. The discount rate for the merged qualified plan that has been terminated is determined by examining the current assumed lump sum and annuity purchase rates. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the plan s target allocation and historical returns for each asset class on a plan by plan basis. Certain of the Company s pension plans use assumptions on expected compensation increases of plan participants. These increases are determined by an actuarial analysis of the plan participants, their expected compensation increases, and the duration of their earnings period until retirement. Each of these assumptions is reviewed as plan characteristics change and on an annual basis with input from senior pension and financial executives and the Company s external actuarial consultants.  
    
  The discount rate for determining plan benefit obligations was   4.0%   in 2016 and   4.25%   in 2015 for all plans except the terminated qualified plan. The discount rate for the terminated qualified plan was   3.09%   and   3.25%   in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The expected long-term rate of return for the plans ranged from   4.0%   to   5.5%   in 2016 and ranged from   5.75%   to   6.75%   in 2015. The rate of compensation increases for certain of the plans with active participants ranged from   4.0%   to   6.0%   in 2016 and 2015. 
    
  Return on Plan Assets 
    
  The Company's investment strategy is liability management driven. The qualified pension plan asset allocations targets are to hold fixed income investments based upon this strategy. As of December 31, 2016, investment allocations for the two qualified defined benefit plans range from   80%   to   100%   in fixed income and   0%   to   20%   in equities. The following tables show the fair value allocation of plan assets by asset category as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. 

55 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

As of December 31, 2016, the Company s qualified defined benefit pension plan assets consisted of   5%   equity,   94%   fixed income and   1%   money market securities of which   7%   were classified as Level 1 and   93%   as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company s qualified defined benefit pension plan assets as of December 31, 2015 consisted of   19%   equity,   79%   fixed income and   2%   money market securities of which   21%   were classified as Level 1 and   79%   as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The Company continued to have no investments in Level 3 alternative investments during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The Company contributed   $25 million  ,   $22 million   and   $42 million   to the pension plans during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company plans to make approximately   $39 million   in contributions to the pension plans during 2017. These contributions include contributions made to certain nonqualified benefit plans for which there is no funding requirement. The Company estimates the following future benefit payments which are calculated using the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016: 

(1) Excludes any payments associated with the ultimate settlement of the terminated plan discussed above. 
    
  Multiemployer Pension Plans 
    
  The Company also contributes to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following aspects: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. 
    
  None of the multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates are individually significant to the Company. Total Company contributions to multiemployer pension plans were   $15 million   in 2016 and   $14 million   in 2015 and 2014. 

56 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Other Postretirement Benefits 
    
  The Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees who meet eligibility requirements. The Company s funding policy is generally to pay covered expenses as they are incurred. For retiree medical plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company s other postretirement benefits have an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of   $24 million   and   $33 million  , respectively. Net periodic benefit costs related to these other postretirement benefits were   $1 million  ,   $2 million   and   $1 million   in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  
    
  Pursuant to various collective bargaining agreements, the Company also contributes to multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover certain union-represented employees. The plans provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain employees who meet eligibility requirements. Total Company contributions to multiemployer health and welfare plans were   $52 million  ,   $60 million   and   $58 million   in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

9    Stock Incentive Plans 
    
  Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the stock award (generally   three   to   five   years) using the straight-line method. The following table is a summary of stock-based compensation for each of the respective periods: 

(1) 
    Includes the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) 
     (2)    Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes   $38 million   associated with accelerated vesting of restricted stock replacement awards issued to Omnicare executives who were terminated subsequent to the acquisition. 
     
  The recognized tax benefit was   $22 million  ,   $26 million   and   $33 million   for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  
    
  The ESPP provides for the purchase of up to   30 million   shares of common stock. Under the ESPP in 2016, eligible employees could purchase common stock at the end of each six month offering period at a purchase price equal to   90%   of the lower of the fair market value on the first day or the last day of the offering period. Prior to 2016, the purchase price was equal to   85%   of the lower of the fair market value on the first day or the last day of the offering period. During 2016, approximately   1 million   shares of common stock were purchased under the provisions of the ESPP at an average price of   $84.68   per share. As of December 31, 2016, approximately   12 million   shares of common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP. 
    
  The fair value of stock-based compensation associated with the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant (the first day of the six month offering period) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
    
  The following table is a summary of the assumptions used to value the ESPP awards for each of the respective periods:  

(1) 
    The dividend yield is calculated based on semi-annual dividends paid and the fair market value of the Company s stock at the grant date. 
              (2) 
    The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s daily stock market prices over the previous six month period. 
              (3) 
    The risk-free interest rate is based on the Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected term of ESPP options (i.e.,   six   months). 
              (4) 
    The expected life is based on the semi-annual purchase period. 
       
  The terms of the Company s Incentive Compensation Plan ( ICP ) provide for grants of annual incentive and long-term performance awards to executive officers and other officers and employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company. Payment of such annual incentive and long-term performance awards will be in cash, stock, other awards or other property, at  
  
   57 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

the discretion of the Management Planning and Development Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. The ICP allows for a maximum of   74 million   shares to be reserved and available for grants. The ICP is the only compensation plan under which the Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to its employees, with the exception of the Company s ESPP. As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately   18 million   shares available for future grants under the ICP. 
    
  The Company s restricted awards are considered nonvested share awards and require no payment from the employee. Compensation cost is recorded based on the market price of the Company s common stock on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company granted   1,992,000  ,   2,695,000   and   2,708,000   restricted stock units with a weighted average fair value of   $103.26  ,   $100.81   and   $73.60   in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, there was   $327 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock units that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.29   years. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was   $218 million  ,   $164 million   and   $57 million  , respectively. 
    
  The following table is a summary of the restricted stock unit and restricted share award activity for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

All grants under the ICP are awarded at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock options granted generally become exercisable over a   four  -year period from the grant date. Stock options generally expire   seven years   after the grant date. 
    
  Excess tax benefits of   $72 million  ,   $127 million   and   $106 million   were included in financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flow during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised, which includes the ESPP, totaled   $224 million  ,   $299 million   and   $421 million   during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was   $244 million  ,   $394 million   and   $372 million   in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was   $298 million  ,   $334 million   and   $292 million  , respectively. 
    
  The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions at the time of grant:  

(1) 
    The dividend yield is based on annual dividends paid and the fair market value of the Company s stock at the grant date. 
              (2) 
    The expected volatility is estimated using the Company s historical volatility over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant after adjustments for infrequent events such as stock splits. 
              (3) 
    The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options being valued. 
              (4) 
    The expected life represents the number of years the options are expected to be outstanding from grant date based on historical option holder exercise experience. 
       
  As of December 31, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options totaled   $79 million  , which the Company expects to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.79   years. After considering anticipated forfeitures, the Company expects approximately   11 million   of the unvested stock options to vest over the requisite service period.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The Company has   $4.2 billion   of net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The following table is a summary of the components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31: 

The Company assesses positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not some portion of a deferred tax asset would not be realized. When it would not, a valuation allowance is established for such portion of a deferred tax asset.  
    
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

The Company and most of its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of numerous state and local jurisdictions. The Company is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process ( CAP ), which is a voluntary program offered by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) under which participating taxpayers work collaboratively with the IRS to identify and resolve potential tax issues through open, cooperative and transparent interaction prior to the filing of their federal income tax. The IRS is currently examining the Company s 2015 and 2016 consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are also currently under income tax examinations by a number of state and local tax authorities. As of December 31, 2016, no examination has resulted in any proposed adjustments that would result in a material change to the Company s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  
    
  Substantially all material state and local income tax matters have been concluded for fiscal years through 2010. Certain state exams will be concluded and certain state statutes will lapse in 2017, and the change in the balance of our uncertain tax positions will be immaterial. In addition, it is reasonably possible that the Company s unrecognized tax benefits could change within the next twelve months due to the anticipated conclusion of various examinations with the IRS for various years. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time. 
    
  The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense. The Company recognized interest of approximately   $10 million   in 2016,   $5 million   in 2015 and   $6 million   in 2014. The Company  
  
   60 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

had approximately   $30 million   and   $16 million   accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  There are no material uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016 the ultimate deductibility of which is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing. If there were, any such items would impact deferred tax accounting only, not the annual effective income tax rate, and would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to a period earlier than expected. 
    
  As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is approximately   $276 million  , after considering the federal benefit of state income taxes. 

11    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Lease Guarantees 
    
  Between 1991 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob s Stores, Linens  n Things, Marshalls, Kay-Bee Toys, Wilsons, This End Up and Footstar. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the store s lease obligations. When the subsidiaries were disposed of, the Company s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser has agreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries were to become insolvent and failed to make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy these obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the Company guaranteed approximately   87   such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens  n Things, which are discussed in Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies ), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through   2047  . 
    
  In April 2016, the parent entity of Bob s Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As described above, the Company, through one or more of its affiliates, is alleged to have guaranteed certain of the Bob s Stores  leases (the  Bob s Leases ). On June 20, 2016, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of substantially all of the assets of Bob s Stores and certain other assets to a new entity ( Buyer ), which designated Buyer s affiliate Bob s Stores, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( New Bob s ), to acquire substantially all of the assets of Bob s Stores. 
    
  The Company, through its subsidiary, CVS Pharmacy, Inc., and New Bob s entered into an agreement in October 2016, pursuant to which, in exchange for an immaterial payment to be made by CVS Pharmacy, Inc., New Bob s agreed to accept the assignment of the Bob s Leases and to be bound by certain restrictions regarding renewals, extensions and modifications to the Bob s Leases. The Company believed these restrictions would potentially reduce the Company's exposure to liability under guarantees of the Bob s Leases in the future. The bankruptcy court approved the assignment of the Bob s Leases to New Bob's on November 7, 2016, and all of the Bob s Leases were assigned to New Bob s.  
    
  On February 5, 2017, New Bob s and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the  Debtors ) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Certain documents filed in connection with the Debtors  bankruptcy case suggest that the Debtors may enter into an asset purchase agreement with Sports Direct Retail Ltd. ( Sports Direct ), for Sports Direct to serve as an initial bidder in an asset sale process to be conducted pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company will monitor the Debtors  bankruptcy proceedings. 
    
  Legal Matters 
    
  The Company is a party to legal proceedings, investigations and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including the matters described below. The Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability. None of the Company s accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company s financial position. 
    
  The Company s contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties, including, among other factors: (i) the procedural status of pending matters; (ii) whether class action status is sought and certified; (iii) whether asserted claims or allegations will survive dispositive motion practice; (iv) the extent of potential damages, fines or penalties, which are often unspecified or indeterminate; (v) the impact of discovery on the legal process; (vi) whether novel or unsettled legal theories are at issue; (vii) the settlement posture of the parties, and/or (viii) in the case of certain government agency investigations, whether a sealed  
  
   61 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

qui tam   lawsuit ( whistleblower  action) has been filed and whether the government agency makes a decision to intervene in the lawsuit following investigation. 
    
  Except as otherwise noted, the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, and is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for these matters. 

In re Pharmacy Benefit Managers Antitrust Litigation   (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania) (consolidating   North Jackson Pharmacy, Inc.   et al   v. Caremark Rx Inc.   et al. (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama)). Beginning in August 2003, various lawsuits were filed by pharmacies alleging that various PBMs were violating certain antitrust laws. In October 2003,   two   independent pharmacies, North Jackson Pharmacy, Inc. and C C, Inc. filed   three   putative class action complaints seeking treble damages and injunctive relief against Caremark (the term  Caremark  as used herein refers to one or more PBM subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable). In August 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring all related PBM antitrust cases, including the North Jackson Pharmacy cases, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated and consolidated proceedings with the cases originally filed in that court. The consolidated action is now known as   In re Pharmacy Benefit Managers Antitrust Litigation  . On January 18, 2017, the court denied the plaintiffs  motion for class certification filed against Caremark, denied a similar motion filed against another PBM, and decertified classes that had been previously certified against other PBMs. 

Indiana State District Council of Laborers and HOD Carriers Pension and Welfare Fund v. Omnicare, Inc.   et al. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky). In February 2006,   two   substantially similar putative class action lawsuits were filed and subsequently consolidated. The consolidated complaint was filed against Omnicare,   three   of its officers and   two   of its directors and purported to be brought on behalf of all open-market purchasers of Omnicare common stock from August 3, 2005 through July 27, 2006, as well as all purchasers who bought shares of Omnicare common stock in Omnicare s public offering in December 2005. The complaint alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and sought, among other things, compensatory damages and injunctive relief. After dismissals and appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the United States Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court. In October 2016, Omnicare filed an answer to plaintiffs  third amended complaint, and discovery commenced.  

Claims Processing Matter.   In December 2007, the Company received a document subpoena from the Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requesting information relating to the processing of Medicaid and certain other government agency claims on behalf of its clients (which allegedly resulted in underpayments from our pharmacy benefit management clients to the applicable government agencies) on one of the Company s adjudication platforms. In September 2014, the Company settled the OIG s claims, as well as related claims by the Department of Justice and private plaintiffs, without any admission of liability. The Company concluded its discussions with the OIG concerning other claim processing issues and resolved those additional matters on December 22, 2016 for the payment of an immaterial amount. 

FTC and Multi-State Investigation.   In March 2010, the Company learned that various State Attorneys General offices and certain other government agencies were conducting a multi-state investigation of certain of the Company s business practices similar to those being investigated at that time by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ).   Twenty-eight   states, the District of Columbia and the County of Los Angeles are known to be participating in this investigation. The prior FTC investigation, which commenced in August 2009, was officially concluded in May 2012 when the consent order entered into between the FTC and the Company became final. The Company has cooperated with the multi-state investigation. 

United States   ex rel.   Jack Chin v. Walgreen Company   et al. (U.S. District Court for the Central District of California). In March 2010, the Company received a subpoena from the OIG requesting information about programs under which the Company has offered customers remuneration conditioned upon the transfer of prescriptions for drugs or medications to the Company s pharmacies in the form of gift cards, cash, non-prescription merchandise or discounts or coupons for non-prescription merchandise. In October 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California unsealed a   qui tam   complaint, filed in April 2009 against CVS Pharmacy and other retail pharmacies, alleging that the Company violated the federal False Claims Act, and the false claims acts of several states, by offering such programs. The federal government has declined intervention in the case. 

United States   ex rel.   James Banigan and Richard Templin v. Organon USA Inc.   et al. (U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts). On October 29, 2010, the court unsealed a   qui tam   complaint, which had been under seal  
     
   62 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

since 2007, against Organon, Omnicare, Inc. and PharMerica Corporation. The suit was brought by   two   former employees of Organon, as relators on behalf of the federal government and several state and local governments. The action alleges civil violations of the federal False Claims Act based on allegations that Organon and its affiliates paid Omnicare and several other long-term care pharmacies rebates, post-purchase discounts and other forms of remuneration in return for purchasing pharmaceuticals from Organon and taking steps to increase the purchase of Organon s drugs in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to intervene in this action. The Company has tentatively agreed with the Department of Justice to resolve this matter for   $23 million   plus interest. These financial terms are contingent on approval by authorized officials at the Department of Justice, negotiation of terms of a settlement agreement, approval and releases from the OIG, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and the Department of Justice. While the Company believes that a final settlement will be reached, there can be no assurance that any final settlement agreement will be reached or as to the final terms of such settlement.  

United States   ex rel.   Anthony R. Spay v. CVS Caremark Corporation   et al. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In January 2012, the court unsealed a first amended   qui tam   complaint filed in August 2011 by an individual relator, Anthony Spay, who is described in the complaint as having once been employed by a firm providing pharmacy prescription benefit audit and recovery services. The complaint seeks monetary damages and alleges that Caremark s processing of Medicare claims on behalf of one of its clients violated the federal False Claims Act. The United States declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In September 2015, the Court granted Caremark's motion for summary judgment in its entirety, and entered judgment in favor of Caremark and against Spay. In October 2015, Spay filed a notice of appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit; that court heard oral arguments on the appeal in November 2016. 

State of Texas   ex rel.   Myron Winkelman and Stephani Martinson   et al.   v. CVS Health Corporation   (Travis County District Court). In February 2012, the Attorney General of the State of Texas issued Civil Investigative Demands and has issued a series of subsequent requests for documents and information in connection with its investigation concerning the Health Savings Pass program and other pricing practices with respect to claims for reimbursement from the Texas Medicaid program. In January 2017, the court unsealed a first amended petition. The amended petition alleges the Company violated the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act by submitting false claims for reimbursement to Texas Medicaid by, among other things, failing to use the price available to members of the CVS Health Savings Pass program as the usual and customary price. The amended petition was unsealed following the Company s filing of   CVS Pharmacy, Inc. v. Charles Smith   et al. (Travis County District Court), a declaratory judgment action against the State of Texas in December 2016 seeking a declaration that the prices charged to members of the Health Savings Pass program do not constitute usual and customary prices under the Medicaid regulation. 

California ReadyFill Subpoena.   In November 2012, the Company received a subpoena for documents from the OIG requesting information concerning automatic refill programs used by pharmacies to refill prescriptions for customers. The subpoena was issued in connection with an investigation conducted out of the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Central District of California. The Company produced documents and data. 

Pure Services Subpoena.   In 2013, Omnicare received a subpoena seeking information regarding Omnicare s May 2008 acquisition of Pure Service Pharmacy. In 2016, Omnicare reached an agreement regarding financial terms to resolve, for   $1.5 million   plus interest, the subpoena regarding the acquisition of Pure Service Pharmacy. These financial terms are contingent on approval by authorized officials at the Department of Justice, negotiation of terms of a settlement agreement, approval and releases from the OIG, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and the Department of Justice. While the Company believes that a final settlement will be reached, there can be no assurance that any final settlement agreement will be reached or as to the final terms of such settlement. 

Auto Label Subpoena.   In 2014, Omnicare received a subpoena seeking information regarding Omnicare s Auto Label Verification system. In 2016, Omnicare reached an agreement regarding financial terms to resolve, for   $8 million   plus interest, the subpoena regarding Omnicare s Auto Label Verification system. These financial terms are contingent on approval by authorized officials at the Department of Justice, negotiation of terms of a settlement agreement, approval and releases from the OIG, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and the Department of Justice. While the Company believes that a final settlement will be reached, there can be no assurance that any final settlement agreement will be reached or as to the final terms of such settlement. 

Subpoena Concerning PBM Administrative Fees.   In March 2014, the Company received a subpoena from the United States Attorney s Office for the     District of Rhode Island, requesting documents and information concerning bona fide service fees and rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in connection with certain drugs utilized under  
     
   63 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Part D of the Medicare Program, as well as the reporting of those fees and rebates to Part D plan sponsors. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the subpoena. 

ReadyFill Subpoena (Minnesota).   In May 2015, the Company received a subpoena from the OIG requesting information and documents concerning the Company s automatic refill programs, adherence outreach programs, and pharmacy customer incentives, particularly in connection with claims for reimbursement made to the Minnesota Medicaid program. The Company has been cooperating with the investigation and providing information in response to the subpoena. 

Corcoran   et al.   v. CVS Health Corporation   (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) and   Podgorny   et al.   v. CVS Health Corporation   (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois). These putative class actions were filed against the Company in July and September 2015. The cases were consolidated in United States District Court in the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a class of consumers who purchased certain prescription drugs under the consumer protection statutes and common laws of certain states. Several third-party payors filed similar putative class actions on behalf of payors captioned   Sheet Metal Workers Local No. 20 Welfare and Benefit Fund v. CVS Health Corp.   (U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island) and   Plumbers Welfare Fund, Local 130 v. CVS Health Corporation   (U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island) in February and August 2016. In all of these cases the plaintiffs allege the Company overcharged for certain prescription drugs by not submitting as the pharmacy s usual and customary price the price available to members of the CVS Health Savings Pass program. The Company is defending these actions. 

Omnicare DEA Subpoena.   In September 2015, Omnicare was served with an administrative subpoena by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ). The subpoena seeks documents related to controlled substance policies, procedures, and practices at   eight   pharmacy locations from May 2012 to the present. The Company has been cooperating and providing documents in response to this administrative subpoena. 

Omnicare Cycle Fill CID.   In October 2015, Omnicare received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting information and documents concerning Omnicare s cycle fill process for assisted living facilities. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand. 

PBM Pricing CID.   In October 2015, the Company received from the U.S. Department of Justice a Civil Investigative Demand requesting documents and information in connection with a False Claims Act investigation concerning allegations that the Company submitted, or caused to be submitted, to the Medicare Part D program prescription drug event data that misrepresented true prices paid by the Company s PBM to pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company s PBM. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand. 

United States   ex rel.   Sally Schimelpfenig and John Segura v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc.   (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In November 2015, the court unsealed a second amended   qui tam   complaint filed in September 2015. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to intervene in this action. The relators allege that the Company, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, and Dr. Reddy s Laboratories violated the federal and various state False Claims Acts by dispensing prescriptions in unit dose packaging supplied by Dr. Reddy s that was not compliant with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act and the Poison Preventive Packaging Act and thereby allegedly rendering the drugs misbranded under the Food, Drug   Cosmetic Act. The Company's motion to dismiss remains pending. 

Barchock   et al.   v. CVS Health Corporation   et al. (U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island). In February 2016, an ERISA class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, the Benefit Plans Committee of the Company, and Galliard Capital Management, Inc., by Mary Barchock, Thomas Wasecko, and Stacy Weller, purportedly on behalf of the 401(k) Plan and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of the Company (the  Plan ), and participants in the Plan. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiffs and the Plan by investing too much of the Plan s Stable Value Fund in short-term money market funds and cash management accounts. The Company has moved to dismiss the plaintiffs  amended complaint. 

State of California   ex rel.   Matthew Omlansky v. CVS Caremark Corporation   (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento). In April 2016, the court unsealed a first amended   qui tam   complaint filed in July 2013. The government has declined intervention in this case. The relator alleges that the Company submitted false  
     
   64 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

claims for payment to California Medicaid in connection with reimbursement for drugs available through the Health Savings Pass program as well as certain other generic drugs. The Company s motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. 

DEA Matters.   In October 2016, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of California to resolve alleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) for   $5 million  . The settlement is contingent on the negotiation of terms of a settlement agreement. The Company is also undergoing several audits by the DEA Administrator and is in discussions with the DEA and the U.S. Attorney s Office in several locations concerning allegations that the Company has violated certain requirements of the CSA. 

State of Mississippi v. CVS Health Corporation   et al. (Chancery Court of Desoto County, Mississippi, Third Judicial District). In July 2016, the Company was served with a complaint filed on behalf of the State of Mississippi alleging that CVS retail pharmacies in Mississippi submitted false claims for reimbursement to Mississippi Medicaid by not submitting as the pharmacy s usual and customary price the price available to members of the CVS Health Savings Pass program. The Company has responded to the complaint, filed a counterclaim, and moved to transfer the case to circuit court. 
       
  The Company is also a party to other legal proceedings, government investigations, inquiries and audits, and has received and is cooperating with subpoenas or similar process from various governmental agencies requesting information, all arising in the normal course of its business, none of which is expected to be material to the Company. The Company can give no assurance, however, that its business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected, or that the Company will not be required to materially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations as they may relate to the Company s business, the pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industries or to the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of the Company s business or the pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally; (iv) pending or future government enforcement actions against the Company; (v) adverse developments in any pending   qui tam   lawsuit against the Company, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future   qui tam   lawsuit that may be filed against the Company; or (vi) adverse developments in pending or future legal proceedings against the Company or affecting the pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally. 

12    Segment Reporting 
    
  The Company currently has   three   reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. The Retail/LTC Segment includes the operating results of the Company's Retail Pharmacy and LTC/RxCrossroads operating segments as the operations and economics characteristics are similar. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information for which operating results are evaluated on a regular basis by the Company s chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 
    
  The Company evaluates its Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments  performance based on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate Segment based on operating expenses before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources, therefore the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included. See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies  for a description of the Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate segments and related significant accounting policies. 
    
  In 2016, approximately   11.2%   of the Company s consolidated net revenues were from Aetna, a Pharmacy Services Segment client. In 2015 and 2014, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company s consolidated net revenues. More than   99%   of the Company s consolidated net revenues are earned and long-lived assets are located in the United States. 

65 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table is a reconciliation of the Company s business segments to the consolidated financial statements:  

(1) 
    Net revenues of the Pharmacy Services Segment include approximately   $10.5 billion  ,   $8.9 billion   and   $8.1 billion   of Retail Co-Payments for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Retail Co-Payments.  
              (2) 
    Intersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services Segment and the Retail/LTC Segment. These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients ( members ) fill prescriptions at the Company s retail pharmacies to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice         elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company s retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at the Company s long-term care pharmacies. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis.

Five-Year Financial Summary

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of CVS Health Corporation 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CVS Health Corporation at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), CVS Health Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated     Framework     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 9, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
