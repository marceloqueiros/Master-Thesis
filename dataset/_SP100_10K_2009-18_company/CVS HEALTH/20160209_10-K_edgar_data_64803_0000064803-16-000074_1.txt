PART I 
    Item 1. Business 
    
  Overview 
    
  CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively  CVS Health,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ), is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health. At the forefront of a changing health care landscape, the Company has an unmatched suite of capabilities and the expertise needed to drive innovations that will help shape the future of health. 
    
  We are currently the only integrated pharmacy health care company with the ability to impact consumers, payors, and providers with innovative, channel-agnostic solutions to complex challenges managing costs and care. We have a deep understanding of their diverse needs through our unique integrated model, and we are bringing them innovative solutions that help increase access to quality care, deliver better health outcomes, and lower overall health care costs.  
    
  Through our approximately 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with more than 75 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year, and expanding specialty pharmacy services, we enable people, businesses, and communities to manage health in more affordable, effective ways. We are delivering break-through products and services, from advising patients on their medications at our CVS Pharmacy        locations, to introducing unique programs to help control costs for our clients at CVS Caremark       , to innovating how care is delivered to our patients with complex conditions through CVS Specialty   TM   , to improving pharmacy care for the senior community through Omnicare       , or by expanding access to high-quality, low-cost care at CVS MinuteClinic   TM   . 
    
  We have three reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  The Pharmacy Services Segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) solutions, as described more fully below, to our clients consisting primarily of employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans, plans offered on the public and private exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. In addition, through our SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. The Pharmacy Services Segment operates under the CVS Caremark        Pharmacy Services, Caremark       , CVS Caremark       ,  CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , CVS Specialty   TM   , Accordant       , SilverScript       , NovoLogix       , Coram       , Navarro        Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts names. As of December 31, 2015, the Pharmacy Services Segment operated   24   retail specialty pharmacy stores,   11   specialty mail order pharmacies and   five   mail order dispensing pharmacies, and   83   branches for infusion and enteral services, including approximately   73   ambulatory infusion suites and   six   centers of excellence, located in   40   states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our PBM filled or managed approximately   1.0 billion   prescriptions. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Business Strategy   - Our business strategy centers on providing innovative tools and strategies, as well as quality client service in order to help improve clinical outcomes for our clients  health benefit plan members while assisting our clients and their plan members in better managing overall health care costs. Our goal is to produce superior results for our clients and their plan members by leveraging our expertise in core PBM services, including: plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. 
    
  In addition, as a fully integrated pharmacy services company, we are able to offer our clients and their plan members a variety of programs, tools and plan designs that benefit from our integrated systems and the ability of our more than 34,000 pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants to interact personally with the many plan members. Through our multiple member touch points (retail stores, mail order, infusion, long-term care and specialty pharmacies, retail medical clinics, call centers, prescription management services, proprietary websites and mobile devices), we seek to engage plan members in behaviors that help lower cost and improve health care outcomes. Examples of these programs and services include: Maintenance Choice       , a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our retail pharmacy stores for the same price as mail order; Pharmacy Advisor       , a program that facilitates face-to-face and telephone counseling by our pharmacists to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions;  
    3 

compliance and persistency programs designed to help ensure that patients take their medications in the proper manner; enhanced disease management programs that are targeted at managing chronic disease states; Specialty Connect   TM   , our integrated specialty pharmacy offering which integrates specialty mail and retail capabilities, providing members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a CVS Pharmacy location or submit it through our specialty mail order pharmacies; and an ExtraCare        Health Card program which offers discounts to eligible plan members on certain over-the-counter health care products sold in our CVS Pharmacy stores. In addition, MinuteClinic        is an important and differentiated part of the enterprise that offers certain capabilities to PBM clients and their members. For example, we offer plan sponsored co-pay reductions to encourage use of MinuteClinic, thereby reducing emergency room visits and helping to lower overall health care costs. Other ways we are working with our clients include partnerships with health plan clients sponsoring patient centered medical homes, biometric screenings for plan members, closing gaps in care, and onsite clinics at client corporate headquarters. 
    
  PBM Services   - Our PBM solutions are described more fully below. 
    
  Plan Design Offerings and Administration   - Our clients sponsor pharmacy benefit plans that facilitate the ability of eligible members in these plans to receive prescribed medications. We assist our clients in designing pharmacy benefit plans that help minimize the costs to the client while prioritizing the welfare and safety of the clients  members and helping improve health outcomes. We also administer these benefit plans selected by our clients and assist them in monitoring the effectiveness of these plans through frequent, informal communications, their use of our proprietary software, as well as through a formal annual client review. 
    
  We make recommendations to our clients helping them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lower cost, clinically appropriate drugs. We help our clients control costs by offering plan designs that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available. Our clients also have the option, through plan design, to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products on their drug lists or  formularies . 
    
  Formulary Management   - We utilize an independent panel of doctors, pharmacists and other medical experts, referred to as our Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, to select drugs that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on our formularies. Our formularies provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to ensure member access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the client s pharmacy benefit plan. To help improve clinical outcomes for members and clients, we conduct ongoing, independent reviews of all drugs, including, but not limited to, those appearing on the formularies and generic equivalent products, as well as our clinical programs. Many of our clients choose to adopt our template formulary offerings as part of their plan design. 
    
  Medicare Part D Services   - We participate in the administration of the drug benefit added to the Medicare program under Part D of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ) through the provision of PBM services to our health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as Medicare Part D prescription drug plans ( PDP ) and by offering Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits through SilverScript, a PDP approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). We also assist employer, union and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy made available under the MMA by collecting and submitting eligibility and/or drug cost data to CMS in order for them to obtain the subsidy. 
    
  Mail Order Pharmacy   - As of December 31, 2015, we operated   five   mail order dispensing pharmacies in the United States. Plan members or their prescribers submit prescriptions or refill requests, primarily for maintenance medications, to these pharmacies via mail, telephone, fax, e-prescribing or the Internet. We also operate a network of smaller mail order specialty pharmacies described below. Our staff pharmacists review mail order prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of our prescription management systems. This review may involve communications with the prescriber and, with the prescriber s approval when required, can result in generic substitution, therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to help reduce cost and/or improve quality of treatment. These pharmacies have been awarded Mail Order Pharmacy accreditation from Utilization Review Accreditation Commission ( URAC ), a Washington DC-based health care accrediting organization that establishes quality standards for the health care industry. 
    
  Specialty Pharmacy   - Our specialty pharmacies support individuals who require complex and expensive drug therapies. As of December 31, 2015, our specialty pharmacy operations included   11   specialty mail order pharmacies located throughout the United States that are used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases and disorders. Substantially all of these pharmacies have been accredited by the Joint Commission, which is an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies nearly 21,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. These pharmacies have also been awarded Specialty Pharmacy accreditation from URAC. As of December 31, 2015, the Company  
    4 

operated a network of   24   retail specialty pharmacy stores, which operate under the CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM    and Navarro        Health Services names. These stores average 1,100 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications, homeopathic remedies and vitamins. In January 2014, we enhanced our offerings of specialty infusion services and began offering enteral nutrition services through Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ), which we acquired on January 16, 2014. Coram is one of the nation s largest providers of comprehensive infusion services, caring for approximately 140,000 patients annually. In May 2014, we implemented Specialty Connect   TM   , which integrates our specialty pharmacy mail and retail capabilities, providing members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a CVS Pharmacy location. Whether submitted through our mail order pharmacy or at a CVS Pharmacy, all prescriptions are filled through our specialty mail order pharmacies, so all revenue from this specialty prescription services program is recorded within the Pharmacy Services Segment. Members then can choose to pick up their medication at their local CVS Pharmacy or have it sent to their home through the mail. In August 2015, with the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ), we expanded our specialty pharmacy to include the specialty pharmacy operations of Omnicare which operates under the name Advanced Care Scripts. 
    
  Retail Pharmacy Network     Management   - We maintain a national network of more than   68,000   retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately   41,000   chain pharmacies (which includes our CVS Pharmacy stores) and   27,000   independent pharmacies, in the United States, Puerto Rico, District of Columbia, Guam and the Virgin Islands. When a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the point-of-sale. This data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems, which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility, while also performing a drug utilization review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription. 
    
  Prescription Management Systems   - We dispense prescription drugs both directly, through one of our mail order or specialty pharmacies, or through a network of retail pharmacies, described above. All prescriptions processed through our systems, whether they are filled through one of our mail order or specialty dispensing pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network, are analyzed, processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems. These systems provide essential features and functionality to allow a plan member to apply their prescription drug benefit. These systems also streamline the process by which prescriptions are processed by staff and network pharmacists, by automating review of various items, including, but not limited to, plan eligibility, early refills, duplicate dispensing, appropriateness of dosage, drug interactions or allergies, over-utilization and potential fraud.   
    
  Clinical Services   - We offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner. Our programs are primarily designed to promote safety, and to help target inappropriate utilization and non-adherence to medication, each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact member health and client pharmacy and medical spend. In this regard, we offer various utilization management, medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement the client s plan design and clinical strategies. 
    
  Disease Management Programs   - Our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers and other third parties. Our Accordant        programs include integrated rare disease management programs, which cover diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson s disease, seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis. The majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ( NCQA ), a private, not-for-profit organization that evaluates, accredits and certifies a wide range of health care organizations. They have also been awarded Case Management Accreditation from URAC. 
    
  Medical Pharmacy Management   - We offer a technology platform that helps identify and capture cost savings opportunities for specialty drugs billed under the medical benefit by identifying outliers to appropriate dosages and costs, and helps to ensure appropriate clinical use of these drugs. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Information Systems   - We currently operate and support a small number of claim adjudication platforms to support our Pharmacy Services Segment. However, the majority of our clients have migrated to one destination platform. These information systems incorporate architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail order prescriptions, adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and delivering other solutions to our PBM clients. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Clients   - Our clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans and plans offered on public and private exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals located throughout the United States. We provide pharmaceuticals to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems, among other things, to help perform safety checks, drug  
    5 

interaction screening and identify opportunities for generic substitution. We generate substantially all of our Pharmacy Services Segment net revenue from dispensing and managing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients. No single PBM client accounts for 10% or more of our annual consolidated revenues. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Seasonality   - The majority of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenues are not seasonal in nature. However, our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D standard benefit design results in coverage that varies with a member's cumulative annual out-of-pocket costs. The benefit design generally results in plan sponsors sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early part of the year. As a result, the PDP plan pay percentage or benefit ratio generally decreases and operating profit generally increases as the year progresses.  
    
  Pharmacy Services Competition   - We believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include: (i) the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers; (ii) the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from, and access to, retail pharmacy networks; (iii) responsiveness to clients  needs; (iv) the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies; (v) the ability to develop and utilize preferred formularies; (vi) the ability to market PBM products and services; (vii) the commitment to provide flexible, clinically-oriented services to clients; (viii) the quality, scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members, and (ix) operational excellence in delivering services. The Pharmacy Services Segment has a significant number of competitors offering PBM services including large, national PBM companies (e.g., Express Scripts), PBMs owned by large national health plans (e.g., OptumRx) and smaller standalone PBMs (e.g., Prime Therapeutics and MedImpact). 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the Retail/LTC Segment included   9,655   retail stores (of which   7,897   were our stores that operated a pharmacy and   1,672   were our pharmacies located within Target Corporation ( Target ) stores), our online retail pharmacy websites, CVS.com       , Navarro.com   TM    and Onofre.com.br   TM   ,   32   onsite pharmacy stores, long-term care pharmacy operations and our retail health care clinics. The retail stores are located in   49   states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy       , CVS       , Longs Drugs       , Navarro Discount Pharmacy        and Drogaria Onofre   TM    names. We currently operate in 98 of the top 100 United States drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 93 of these markets. The CVS Pharmacy retail drugstores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of over-the-counter and personal care products, beauty and cosmetic products, and general merchandise, which we refer to as  front store  products. The pharmacies within Target stores sell prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs that are required to be held behind the counter. Existing retail stores range in size from approximately 5,000 to 30,000 square feet, although most new stores range in size from approximately 8,000 to 13,000 square feet and typically include a drive-thru pharmacy. The pharmacies within Target stores range in size from approximately 450 to 1,100 square feet. During 2015, we filled approximately 1.0 billion prescriptions (counting 90-day prescriptions as three prescriptions), and we held approximately 21.7% of the United States retail pharmacy market. In 2014, our CVS Pharmacy retail drugstores became the first pharmacies in the nation to receive Community Pharmacy Accreditation from URAC. 
    
  On August 18, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Omnicare, broadening our base of pharmacy care to a new dispensing channel, long-term care pharmacy. Omnicare's long-term care ( LTC ) operations include the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. Omnicare also provides commercialization services under the name RxCrossroads       . LTC is comprised of   143   spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders, of which   32   are also hub pharmacies that use automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC primarily operates under the Omnicare        and NeighborCare        names. With the addition of the LTC operations, we are enhancing our service offerings to address the needs of an aging population throughout the continuum of senior care. 
    
  On December 16, 2015, we completed our acquisition of the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target. In connection with the transaction, we acquired Target's   1,672   pharmacies across 47 states and will operate them through a store-within-a-store format, branded as CVS Pharmacy       . In addition, a CVS Pharmacy will be included in all new Target stores that offer pharmacy services. These pharmacies sell prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs that are required to be held behind the counter. The 79 Target clinic locations we acquired will be rebranded as MinuteClinic       , and we expect to open up to 20 new clinics in Target stores within the next three years. This acquisition expands our pharmacy and clinic presence in existing and new markets and it allows us to increase patient access and is an investment in our core business to drive growth. 
    
  Retail Pharmacy Business Strategy   - Our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes. In that regard, the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services, including  
    6 

flu vaccinations as well as face-to-face patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies, closing gaps in care and recommending more cost effective drug therapies. In addition, personalization is central to our retail strategy. Our customer-driven personalization through ExtraCare       , ExtraCare Beauty Club        and MyWeeklyAd   TM    are designed to help us connect directly with individual consumers to deliver a personalized experience. We also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service, innovation and convenience. One of the keys to our strategy is technology, which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services. We are leveraging digital to empower our customers and patients by making the full breadth of health care and pharmacy services available to them anytime, anywhere. We are introducing digital tools to make it easier for people to save time and money and to live healthier lives. We believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers  needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction. 
    
  Retail/LTC Products and Services   - A typical retail store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and proprietary brand merchandise. Front store categories include over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, personal care products, convenience foods, photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise and greeting cards. The stores within Target stores sell prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs that are required to be held behind the counter. The LTC operations include distribution of pharmaceuticals and related consulting and ancillary services. We purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not likely have a material effect on the business. Our clinics offer a variety of health care services by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. 
    
  Retail/LTC net revenues by major product group are as follows:  

(1) 
    Percentages are estimates based on store point-of-sale data for the stores and revenue system data for sales outside the stores. 
              (2) 
    In 2015, prescription drugs include LTC sales and sales in pharmacies within Target stores. 
       
  Pharmacy   - Pharmacy revenues represented more than two-thirds of Retail Pharmacy revenues in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to favorable industry trends, e.g., an aging American population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness, and the impact of expanded health insurance coverage through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively,  ACA ), the introduction of new pharmaceutical products, and Medicare Part D. We believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology, as well as our innovative partnerships with health plans, PBMs and providers. Given the nature of prescriptions, people want their prescriptions filled accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology, and ready when promised. Consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars. To assist our customers with these needs, we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier, easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs, improve health, and save lives. Examples include: our Patient Care Initiative, an enhanced medication adherence program; Maintenance Choice       , a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our retail pharmacy stores for the same price as mail order; and Pharmacy Advisor       , our program that facilitates pharmacist counseling, both face-to-face and over the telephone, to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions; Specialty Connect   TM   , our integrated specialty pharmacy offering which integrates specialty mail and retail capabilities, providing members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a CVS Pharmacy location or submit it through our specialty mail order pharmacies; as well as   ScriptSync , a new pharmacy service introduced in 2015 that enables patients with multiple medications to pick up their eligible maintenance prescriptions in a single monthly CVS Pharmacy visit  . Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy Advisor, Specialty Connect and ScriptSync are all programs that demonstrate our ability to enhance the customer experience through our integrated enterprise products and services. Further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology, such as our Drug Utilization Review system that helps check for harmful interactions between prescription drugs and patient identified over-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal remedies;  
    7 

our proprietary pharmacy system that integrates our product delivery and clinical workflows as well as advanced patient safety functionality such as drug utilization review, RxConnect; our prescription refill program, ReadyFill       ; and our online retail businesses, CVS.com, Navarro.com and Onofre.com.br. In December 2015, we expanded our pharmacy offering with the acquisition of the pharmacies within Target stores. Once the system integration is complete, we will offer all the same pharmacy services offered in our retail drugstores and online at our pharmacies within Target stores. 
    
  Front Store   - Front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services, using innovative personalized marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers  needs and preferences. A key component of our front store strategy is our ExtraCare        card program, which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base. The ExtraCare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the United States. The ExtraCare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices, customized coupons, ExtraBucks        rewards and other benefits. Similar to ExtraCare is the Beauty Club, another program that rewards our loyal customers with sales prices and customized coupons. We continue to launch and enhance new and exclusive brands like Nuance Salma Hayek   TM   , MakeUp Academy   TM    and NYX        to create unmatched offerings in beauty. Another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings, which include a full range of high-quality CVS Pharmacy        and proprietary brand products that are only available through CVS Pharmacy stores. We currently carry over 6,400 CVS Pharmacy and proprietary brand products, which accounted for approximately 21.3% of our front store revenues during 2015. These products include expanded offerings of healthy foods and vitamins. Furthermore, we are tailoring certain groups of stores, such as suburban area stores, to better meet the needs of our customers.  
    
  MinuteClinic -   As of December 31, 2015, we operated   1,135   MinuteClinic        locations in 33 states and the District of Columbia, of which   1,049   were located in CVS Pharmacy stores and   79   were located in Target stores. We opened 85 new clinics during 2015 and acquired 79 clinics from Target in December 2015. Our clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally established guidelines to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions, provide wellness services and deliver vaccinations. Insurers value our clinics because they provides convenient, high-quality, cost-effective care, in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more expensive sites of care. As a result, visits paid for by employers, health insurers or other third parties accounted for approximately 89% of MinuteClinic s total revenues in 2015. MinuteClinic is collaborating with our Pharmacy Services Segment to help meet the needs of CVS Caremark s client plan members by offering programs that can improve member health and lower costs. MinuteClinic is now affiliated with 63 major health systems and continues to build a platform that supports primary care.  
    
  Long-term Care   - Through our Omnicare business, we provide the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. LTC's customers consist of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, independent living communities, hospitals, correctional facilities, and other health care service providers. We provide pharmacy consulting, including monthly patient drug therapy evaluations, assist in compliance with state and federal regulations and provide proprietary clinical and health management programs. We also provide pharmaceutical case management services for retirees, employees and dependents who have drug benefits under corporate-sponsored health care programs.  
    
  Onsite Pharmacies   - We also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites, typically under the CarePlus       , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM    or CVS Pharmacy        name, which provide certain health plan members and customers with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions. 
    
  Retail Pharmacy Drugstore Development   - The addition of new stores has played, and will continue to play, a key role in our continued growth and success. Our store development program focuses on three areas: entering new markets, adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient sites. During 2015, we opened 161 new retail pharmacy stores, acquired 1,672 pharmacies within Target stores and 14 other locations, relocated 58 stores and closed 31 stores. During the last five years, we opened more than 1,100 new and relocated stores, and acquired 1,832 stores including the pharmacies acquired from Target. We believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in more accessible markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current health care environment. As a result, we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position given the changing health care landscape and to meet the increasing needs of our customers. 
    
  Retail/LTC Information Systems   - We have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver exceptional customer service, enhance safety and quality, and expand our patient care services while lowering operating costs. Leveraging our retail pharmacy fulfillment system, RxConnect and our proprietary WeCARE Workflow, supports our pharmacy teams by prioritizing work to meet customer expectations, facilitating prescriber outreach, and seamlessly integrating our clinical programs. This solution delivers improved efficiency and enhances the customer experience, as well as providing a framework to accommodate the evolution of pharmacy practice and the expansion of our clinical programs. Our Health Engagement  
    8 

Engine   TM    technology and proprietary clinical algorithms enable us to help identify opportunities for our pharmacists to deliver face-to-face counseling regarding patient health and safety matters, including adherence issues, gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions. Our digital strategy empowers the consumer to navigate their pharmacy experience and manage their condition through our on-line and mobile tools that offer utility and convenience. This will include the ability to schedule an appointment at MinuteClinic, get next-in line alerts or health reminders and appointment updates via text messages. Our integrated digital offerings help patients seamlessly manage retail, mail and specialty prescriptions dispensed by a CVS Pharmacy or long-term care location and enhance front store personalization to drive value for customers. We experienced strong adoption of our digital solutions with our mobile app receiving critical acclaim for ease of use and our text message program experiencing significant growth. LTC's Digital Technology suite, Omniview       , improves the efficiency of customers' operations with tools that include executive dashboards, pre-admission pricing, electronic ordering of prescription refills, proof-of-delivery tracking, access to patient profiles, receipt and management of facility bills, and real-time validation of Medicare Part D coverage, among others capabilities.  
    
  Retail/LTC Customers   - Managed care organizations, government-funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third party plans accounted for 98.8% of our 2015 pharmacy revenues. The loss of any one payor would not have a material effect on our business. No single Retail/LTC payor accounts for 10% or more of our annual consolidated revenues. However, the success of our retail drugstore and long-term care businesses is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms.  
    
  Retail/LTC Seasonality   - The majority of our revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, are generally not seasonal in nature. However, retail front store revenues tend to be higher during the December holiday season. In addition, both pharmacy and retail front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season. For additional information, we refer you to  Risks related to the seasonality of our business  in Item 1A. Risk Factors.  
    
  Retail/LTC Competition   - The retail drugstore business is highly competitive. We believe that we compete principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience, (ii) customer service and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety and (iv) price. In the markets we serve, we compete with other drugstore chains (e.g., Walgreens and Rite Aid), supermarkets, discount retailers (e.g., Wal-Mart), independent pharmacies, restrictive pharmacy networks, membership clubs, Internet companies, and retail health clinics, as well as other mail order pharmacies and PBMs. LTC pharmaceutical services are highly regional or local in nature and within a given geographic area of operation, highly competitive. Our largest competitor nationally is PharMerica. We also compete with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned by long-term care facilities and local retail pharmacies. Some states have enacted  freedom of choice  or  any willing provider  requirements as part of their state medicaid programs or in separate legislation, which may increase the competition that we face in providing services to long-term care facility residents in these states. 
    
  Corporate Segment 
    
  Our Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the overall operations of the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of our executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, corporate information technology and finance departments. 
    
  Generic Sourcing Venture 
    
  In July 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ( Cardinal ) established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ( Red Oak ), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own 50%. The Red Oak arrangement has an initial term of ten years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company.  
    
  Working Capital Practices 
    
  We fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper, proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and long-term borrowings. For additional information on our working capital practices, we refer you to the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources  in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015, which section is incorporated by reference herein. The majority of our non-pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards, while managed care and other third party insurance programs, which typically settle in less than 30 days, represented approximately 99.6% of our consolidated pharmacy revenues in 2015, including both Retail/LTC and Pharmacy Services. The remainder of consolidated pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards. Our customer returns are not significant. 
    9 

Colleague Development 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 243,000 colleagues, which included more than 34,000 pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The total included approximately 88,000 part-time colleagues who work less than 30 hours per week. To deliver the highest levels of service to our customers, we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards. We emphasize attracting and training knowledgeable, friendly and helpful associates to work in our organization. 
    
  Intellectual Property 
    
  We have registered and/or applied to register a variety of our trademarks and service marks used throughout our business, as well as domain names, and rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, in addition to contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value in our Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments. We are not aware of any facts that could materially impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property. 
    
  Government Regulation 
    
  Overview   - Much of our business is subject to federal and state laws and regulations. In addition, many of our PBM clients and our payors in the Retail/LTC Segment, including insurers and managed care organizations ( MCOs ), are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor. Similarly, our LTC clients, such as skilled nursing facilities, are also subject to many of the same government regulations to which we are subject. The application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty. Further, there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels, some of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted. We are unable to predict what federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general, or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on our business. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations as summarized below, or any adverse applications of, or changes in, the laws and regulations affecting our business, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and/or financial condition. See Item 3,  Legal Proceedings  for further information. 
    
  Although we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our various business lines, we cannot give any assurances that our business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected, or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations, including the laws and regulations described in this Government Regulation section, as they may relate to our business, the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or to the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally; (iv) institution of government enforcement actions against us; (v) adverse developments in any pending   qui tam   lawsuit against us, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future   qui tam   lawsuit that may be filed against us; or (vi) adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally. 
    
  Laws and Regulations Related to Each Operating Segment of Our Business 
    
  Laws Related to Reimbursement by Government Programs   - We are subject to various state and federal laws concerning our submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored health care programs. Potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, multiples damages, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act ( FCA ), various state false claims acts, the federal  Stark Law  and related state laws. In particular, the FCA prohibits intentionally submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. As part of ACA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended in 2010 to provide that any claim for government reimbursement violates the FCA where it results from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file   qui tam   or  whistleblower  lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government. Further, the federal Stark Law generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient prescription drugs, to any entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for  
    10 

reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral. Various states have enacted similar laws. 
    
  Anti-Remuneration Laws   - Federal law prohibits, among other things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject to certain exceptions and  safe harbors,  any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal health care programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment, criminal and civil fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored health care programs.  
    
  Antitrust and Unfair Competition   - The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTCA ) to investigate and prosecute practices that are  unfair trade practices  or  unfair methods of competition.  Numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies and/or PBMs under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging, among other things: (i) brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, (ii) the maintenance of retail pharmacy networks by PBMs, and (iii) various other business practices of PBMs and retail pharmacies. To the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or CVS Pharmacy plays a unique or expanded role in a PBM product offering, our business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anti-competitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties.  
    
  Privacy and Confidentiality Requirements   - Many of our activities involve the receipt, use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information ( PII ) as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws, which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information. In addition to PII, we use and disclose de-identified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted. Additionally, there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit     credit card information maintain a secure environment. Certain states have recently incorporated these requirements into state laws. 
    
  The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively,  HIPAA ) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, health care providers, health care clearinghouses (known as  covered entities ) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information ( PHI ). Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with HIPAA standards. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the  HITECH Act ), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, amended HIPAA to impose additional restrictions on third-party funded communications using PHI and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for PHI. It also extended HIPAA privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates. In addition to HIPAA, state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA. 
    
  Finally, the Health Insurance Marketplaces (formerly known as the  exchanges ) are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to PII, and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of PII as those the Health Insurance Marketplace has implemented for itself or non-Health Insurance Marketplace entities, which include insurers offering plans through the Health Insurance Marketplaces and their designated downstream entities, including PBMs and other business associates. These standards may differ from, and be more stringent than, HIPAA. 
    
  Consumer Protection Laws   - The federal government has many consumer protection laws, such as the FTCA, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. These laws have been the basis for investigations, lawsuits and multi-state settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs and health care services, pricing accuracy, expired front store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs and disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected. 
    
  Government Agreements and Mandates   - The Company and/or its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees, settlement agreements, and corporate integrity agreements with various federal, state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices, pseudoephedrine products, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, expired products, environmental and safety matters, marketing and advertising practices, PBM and pharmacy operations and various other business practices. These agreements contain certain ongoing reporting, monitoring or other compliance requirements for the Company. Failure to meet the Company s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies, financial penalties, administrative remedies, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. 
    11 

Environmental and Safety Regulation   - Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment, public health and employee safety, including, for example, regulations governing the management of hazardous substances, the cleaning up of contaminated sites, and the maintenance of safe working conditions in our stores, distribution centers and other facilities. Governmental agencies on the federal, state and local levels have, in recent years, increasingly focused on the retail and healthcare sectors  compliance with such laws and regulations, and have at times pursued enforcement activities. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities. 
    
  Health Reform Legislation   - Passed in 2010, ACA affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country. In addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage, ACA enacted a number of significant health care reforms. Many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients. As a result, these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices. Some significant ACA provisions are still being finalized (e.g., nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage), so the full impact of ACA on our Company is still uncertain. 
    
  Pharmacy and Professional Licensure and Regulation   - We are subject to a variety of intersecting state and federal statutes and regulations that govern the wholesale distribution of drugs; operation of retail, specialty, infusion, LTC and mail order pharmacies; licensure of facilities and professionals, including pharmacists, technicians and nurses; registration of facilities with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and analogous state agencies that regulate controlled substances; packaging, storing, shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals; repackaging of drug products; labeling, medication guides and other consumer disclosures; interactions with prescribers and healthcare professionals; compounding of prescription medications; dispensing of controlled and non-controlled substances; counseling of patients; transfers of prescriptions; advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services; security; inventory control; recordkeeping; reporting to Boards of Pharmacy, the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the DEA and related state agencies; and other elements of pharmacy practice. Pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with a wide variety of local, state and federal agencies, with various powers to investigate, inspect, audit or solicit information, including Boards of Pharmacy and Nursing, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Justice, the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and others. Many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers, conduct audits on a regular basis, can impose substantial fines and penalties, and may revoke the license, registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional.  
    
  Telemarketing and Other Outbound Contacts   - Certain federal and state laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. 
    
  Laws and Regulations Related to Our Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole, we are subject to federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our Pharmacy Services Segment specifically. Among these are the following: 
    
  PBM Laws and Regulation   - Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states. This legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect. 
    
  In addition, certain quasi-regulatory organizations, including the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBM activities. Similarly, credentialing organizations such as the NCQA and URAC may establish voluntary standards regarding PBM or specialty pharmacy activities. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting organizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for PBM or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients and/or the services we provide to them. 
     
  Medicare Part D   - The Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through private insurers, regulates all aspects of the provision of Medicare drug coverage, including enrollment, formularies, pharmacy networks, marketing, and claims processing. The Medicare Part D program has undergone significant  
    12 

legislative and regulatory changes since its inception, and continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny. The applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve. CMS has imposed restrictions and issued new requirements to protect Medicare Part D beneficiaries and has used its authority to sanction and impose civil monetary penalties on plans for non-compliance. 
    
  Network Access Legislation   - Medicare Part D and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Certain  any willing provider  legislation may require us or our clients to admit a non-participating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation. These laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network. 
    
  Also, a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability (and the health plans  ability) to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to us for payment. These laws could negatively impact our ability to recover overpayments in health care payments stemming from pharmacy audits. Lastly, several states have passed legislation regulating our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs ( MAC ). MAC methodology is a common cost management practice used to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs, including private and public payors. MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies, the kinds of drugs that a PBM can pay at a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could negatively impact our ability to establish MAC prices for generic drugs.  
    
  Contract Audits   - We are subject to audits of many of our contracts, including our PBM client contracts, our PBM rebate contracts, our contracts relating to Medicare Part D and the agreements our pharmacies enter into with payors. Because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies, audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs, including those which operate Medicaid fee for service plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare Part D plans or Medicare Advantage organizations.  
    
  Federal Employee Health Benefits Program   - We have a contractual arrangement with carriers for the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal workers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act ( FEHBA ) and as part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. These arrangements subjects us to certain aspects of FEHBA, and other federal regulations, such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation, that otherwise are not applicable to us. 
    
  State Insurance Laws   - PDPs and our PBM service contracts, including those in which we assume certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements, are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states. However, as a PDP, SilverScript is subject to state insurance laws limited to licensure and solvency. In addition, PBM offerings of prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis, or otherwise accepting material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits, may be subject to laws and regulations in various states. Such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer, establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability. Laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing MCOs and limited prepaid health service plans.   
     
  Some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company. These state laws vary, and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires, among other things, that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties. These laws vary from state to state in regard to scope, requirements and application. 
    
  ERISA Regulation   - The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ), provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans, including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide PBM services. In general, we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors. We do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of ERISA, except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility, such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims and/or the appeals of denied claims under a plan, and with respect to the Contraceptive Coverage Mandate, one of the health reforms included in ACA. 
    
    13 

In addition to its fiduciary provisions, ERISA imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received. These provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain. 
    
  Formulary and Plan Design Regulation   - A number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. HHS regulates how Medicare Part D formularies are developed and administered, including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories, subject to limited exceptions. Under ACA, CMS imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits, including plans offered through federal or state exchanges. Additionally, the NAIC and health care accreditation agencies like the NCQA and URAC have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements. Many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. The increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies, networks and other plan design features on behalf of our insurer, MCO and other clients. Similarly, some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive design features. This regulation could limit or preclude (i) limited networks, (ii) a requirement to use particular providers, (iii) copayment differentials among providers and (iv) formulary tiering practices. 
    
  Managed Care Reform   - In addition to health reforms enacted by ACA, proposed legislation has been considered at the state level, and legislation has been enacted in several states, aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans. This legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our PBM health plan clients and/or the services we provide to them. Both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly, and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain. 
    
  Disease Management Services Regulation   - We provide disease management programs to PBM plan members for rare medical conditions and arrange for them to receive disease management programs for common medical conditions. State laws regulate the practice of medicine, the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing. Clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of disease management services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice. 
    
  Third Party Administration and Other State Licensure Laws   - Many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations, such as preferred provider organizations, third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services. Several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs (also known as cash card or discount card programs).  
    
  Laws and Regulations Related to Our Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole, we are subject to federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our Retail/LTC Segment specifically. Among these are the following: 
    
  Specific FDA Regulation   - The FDA generally has authority to, among other things, regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and labeling of many products sold through retail pharmacies, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, medical devices (including mobile medical devices), cosmetics, dietary supplements and certain food items. 
    
  Retail Clinics   - States regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight, lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine. A number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight, signage, third party contracting requirements, bathroom facilities, and scope of services. These laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of our owned and managed retail clinics.

    Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  Our business is subject to various industry, economic, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial: 
    
  Risks of declining gross margins in the PBM, retail pharmacy and LTC pharmacy industries. 
    
  The PBM industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices, enhanced service offerings and/or higher service levels. In that regard, we maintain contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Manufacturer rebates often depend on a PBM s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements, including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer s products on the PBM s formularies. If we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Further, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail  differential  or  spread , which could negatively impact our future profitability. Further, changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, or to formulary management or other PBM services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive. In addition, changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing, including our ability to collect transmission fees, could adversely impact our profitability. 
    
  Both our retail pharmacy and LTC pharmacy businesses have also been affected by the margin pressures described above, including client demands for lower prices, generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure. In addition, as competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. Finally, the margins of our LTC business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements. These actions could also adversely affect the margins of our LTC business. 
    
  Efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices. 
    
  The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBMs, government entities, and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability. In particular, increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs) has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail, LTC and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in the generic profit rate. Historically, the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers. However, in recent years, there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry, and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased costs or to modify our activities to lessen the impact could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. 
    
  In addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels. Efforts to control health care costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuing at the federal and state government levels. Changing political, economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices. For example, we anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems, payment methodologies and operational requirements for health care providers, including LTC facilities and pharmacies. A change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability. 
    
  ACA made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and to reimbursement. One of these changes was to revise the definition of the Average Manufacturer Price, a pricing element common to most payment formulas, and the reimbursement  
    15 

formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs. This change will affect our reimbursement. In addition, ACA made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients, including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees. These ACA changes may not affect our business directly, but they could indirectly impact our services and/or business practices. 
    
  A highly competitive business environment. 
    
  Each of our retail pharmacy business, LTC pharmacy business, retail health clinic business and pharmacy services business currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment.  
    
  The competitive success of our retail pharmacy business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms. As a pharmacy retail business, we compete with other drugstore chains, supermarkets, on-line and other discount retailers, independent pharmacies, membership clubs, Internet companies, convenience stores and mass merchants, many of which are expanding into markets we serve. We also face competition from other retail health clinics, as well as other mail order pharmacies and PBMs. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. 
    
  The competitive success of our LTC pharmacy business is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operations. In the geographic regions we serve, we compete with PharMerica Corporation, our largest competitor, as well as with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned by LTC facilities and local retail pharmacies. 
    
  The competitive success of our pharmacy services business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some PBM clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks. Competitors in the PBM industry (e.g., Express Scripts, OptumRx, Catamaran, Prime Therapeutics, MedImpact and Humana), include large, national PBM companies, PBMs owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone PBMs. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. In addition, changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could adversely affect our claims volume and/or our competitiveness generally. 
    
  Competitors in each of our business areas may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer. Unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings, particularly in a rapidly changing health care industry, we may be unable to remain competitive. 
    
  Risks related to compliance with a broad and complex regulatory framework.    
    
  Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. See  Business - Government Regulation.  In addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels. Changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; or loss of registrations or licensure. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: the laws and regulations described in the Government Regulation section; accounting standards; securities laws and regulations; tax laws and regulations; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous materials and wastes; and laws and regulations of the FTC, the FCC, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products that we sell, such as Boards of Pharmacy. The FDA, DEA and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses, seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, our business interests outside of the United States are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. We are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates, including those described in the Government Regulation section. In that regard, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new  
    16 

government legislative, regulatory action and enforcement activity, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following: 

federal and state laws and regulations concerning the submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs, whether at retail, mail, specialty or LTC; 
                
    federal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, tracking, management, compounding, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services, whether at retail, mail, specialty or LTC, and applicable registration or licensing requirements; 
                
    heighted enforcement of controlled substances regulations; 
                
    the effect of the expiration of patents covering brand name drugs and the introduction of generic products; 
                
    the frequency and rate of approvals by the FDA of new brand name and generic drugs, or of over-the-counter status for brand name drugs; 
                
    rules and regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and the HITECH Act; and other federal and state laws affecting the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of health or other personal information, such as federal laws on information privacy precipitated by concerns about information collection through the Internet, state security breach laws and state laws limiting the use and disclosure of prescriber information; 
                
    consumer protection laws affecting our health care services, our loyalty programs, the products we sell, the informational calls we make and/or the marketing of our goods and services; 
                
    federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, including the management of hazardous substances, storage and transportation of hazardous materials, and various recordkeeping disclosure and procedure requirements promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that may apply to our operations; 
                
    health care reform, managed care reform and plan design legislation; 
                
    FDA regulation affecting the retail, LTC or PBM industry; 
                
    government regulation of the development, administration, review and updating of formularies and drug lists including requirements and/or limitations around formulary tiering and patient cost sharing; 
                
    federal and state laws and regulations establishing or changing prompt payment requirements for payments to retail pharmacies; 
                
    impact of network access legislation or regulations, including  any willing provider  laws, on our ability to manage pharmacy networks; 
                
    administration of Medicare Part D, including legislative changes and/or CMS rulemaking and interpretation; 
                
    Medicare and Medicaid regulations applicable to our LTC pharmacies and those of our client s facilities; 
                
    insurance licensing and other insurance regulatory requirements applicable to offering Medicare Part D programs and services or other health care services;  
                
    government regulation allowing     the importation of prescription drugs from Canada and elsewhere into the United States; and 
                
    direct regulation of pharmacies or PBMs by regulatory and quasi-regulatory bodies. 
       
  The health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve. 
    
  Our business is affected by the economy in general, including changes in consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns. It is possible that a worsening of the economic environment will cause a decline in drug utilization, and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores. Further economic conditions including, interest rate fluctuations, changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute sale-leaseback transactions under acceptable terms. These changes in conditions could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. 
    
  The possibility of client losses and/or the failure to win new business. 
    
  Our PBM business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. PBM client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration, so approximately one third of a PBM s client base typically is subject to renewal each year. In some cases, however, PBM clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract. In addition, the reputational impact of a service-related incident could negatively affect our ability to grow and retain our client base. Further, the PBM industry has been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future. In the event one or more of our PBM clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client, we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business. These circumstances, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Therefore, we continually face challenges in competing for new PBM business and  
    17 

retaining or renewing our existing PBM business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms. 
    
  Additionally, with respect to our LTC pharmacy business, reimbursement under Medicare Part D, as well as reimbursement from certain private third-party payors, is determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representatives. Likewise, reimbursement from skilled nursing facilities for prescriptions we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreements with those skilled nursing facilities. The termination of these agreements generally causes our ability to provide services to any of the residents of that facility to cease, resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those residents. 
    
  Risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products. 
    
  The profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products. Accordingly, our business could be impacted by a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals and/or generic alternatives (the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents). 
    
  The failure or disruption of our information technology systems, our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of     sensitive customer and business information. 
    
  Many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected, processed, stored, and handled by these systems. We rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, claims processing, ExtraCare customer loyalty program, finance, human resource and other processes. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain confidential information, including PII that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services, enroll in programs or services, register on our websites, interact with our personnel, or otherwise communicate with us. In addition, for these operations, we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card information breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities, including ones from a cybersecurity standpoint, designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations. Moreover, a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. 
    
  If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our PBM claims adjudication platforms, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience reputational damage, loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. In addition, compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. 
    
  Risks relating to the market availability, suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell. 
    
  We dispense significant volumes of brand-name and generic drugs from our retail, LTC and mail-order pharmacies and through our PBM s network of retail pharmacies. When increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur, or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances, physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced. 
    
  Additionally, adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs. On occasion, products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to over-the-counter products, which can result in lower prescription utilization. In addition, future FDA rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers. Our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes. 
    
    18 

Further, we acquire a substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacies  prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers. Our agreements with these suppliers are often short-term and easily cancelable by either party without cause. In addition, these agreements may limit our ability to provide services for competing drugs during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than ours. Certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels. A termination or modification to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, many products distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. In the event any products we distribute are in limited supply for significant periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
    
  Regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in Medicare Part D. 
    
  Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization and puts pressure on pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures. Further, as a result of ACA and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules, our PBM clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D business. In addition, if the cost and complexity of Medicare Part D exceed management s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; if changes to the regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; if the government alters Medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to Medicare participants; if CMS imposes restrictions on our Medicare Part D business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions; if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by CMS; or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees, or winning contract renewals or new contracts under Medicare Part D s competitive bidding process, our Medicare Part D services and the ability to expand our Medicare Part D services could be negatively impacted. 
    
  Reform of the United States health care system. 
    
  Congressional efforts to reform the United States health care system came to fruition in 2010 with the passage of ACA, which resulted in significant structural changes to the health insurance system. See  Business - Government Regulation . 
    
  Although many of the changes enacted by ACA have been implemented, some significant provisions have not yet been finalized (e.g., nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage). Therefore, uncertainty remains as to the full impact of ACA on our business. While these provisions may not affect our business directly, they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients. As a result, they could indirectly impact our services and business practices. We cannot predict the effect, if any, the remaining ACA changes may have on our retail pharmacy, LTC pharmacy and pharmacy services businesses, and it is possible that other unanticipated legislative or market-driven changes in the health care system could also occur. 
    
  Possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally. 
    
  It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace Average Wholesale Price ( AWP ) or Wholesale Acquisition Cost ( WAC ), which are the pricing references used for many of our PBM and LTC client contracts, pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. Future changes to the use of AWP, WAC or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs, the reimbursement we receive from PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs and retail pharmacies. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time. 
    
  Product liability, product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation; failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage. 
    
  The products that we sell could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling, recall or other damage. In addition, errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or  
    19 

personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our business involves the provision of professional services including by pharmacists, nurses and nurse practitioners that exposes us to professional liability claims. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and the demand for our products and services, including propriety brands. 
    
  The success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty, superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers, or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services. 
    
  We offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites. The sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls, our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties, and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell private-label products. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which, consequently, could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, that customer confidence is not diminished. Any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty. 
    
  Moreover, customer expectations and new technology advances from our competitors have required that our business evolve so that we are able to interface with our retail customers not only face-to-face in our stores but also online and via mobile and social media. Our customers are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online, as well as to provide public reactions concerning each facet of our operation. If we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectations and new technology developments, our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected. 
    
  Finally, our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients. As a result, the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations. 
    
  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit cards, debit cards, gift cards and potentially other technologies in the future. Acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment options, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and various other forms of electronic payment. If these companies are unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, our operations could be disrupted. The payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to, or exploit any weaknesses in, the payment systems. If we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements, or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse, we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition, our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our results of operations.

We may be unable to successfully integrate companies acquired by us. 
    
  Upon the closing of any acquisition we complete, we will need to successfully integrate the products, services and related assets into our business operations. If an acquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, its products, services and related assets into our company may also be complex and time-consuming and, if the integration is not fully successful, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following: 

Integrating personnel, operations and systems, while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent, high quality products and services; 
                
    Coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; 
                
    Disruption of management s attention from our ongoing business operations; 
                
    Retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; and 
                
    Managing inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations. 
       
  An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation, which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock after the completion of an acquisition. Furthermore, these acquisitions, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products, services or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them. 
    
  Our outstanding debt and associated payment obligations could, among other things, limit our ability to make incremental investments in our business. 
    
  Our current debt service costs associated with our increased debt levels may dampen incremental investments in our business and limit our     flexibility to respond to industry changes and market conditions. In addition, our debt level and related debt service obligations could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any required future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. 
    
  Risks related to the seasonality of our business. 
    
  Although the majority of our revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, are generally not seasonal in nature, front store revenues tend to be higher during the December holiday season. Uncharacteristic or extreme weather conditions can adversely impact consumer shopping patterns as well. This could lead to lost sales, as well as increased snow removal and other costs, thereby negatively affecting our short-term results of operations. In addition, both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which is susceptible to large fluctuations from year to year. 
    
  Risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings. 
    
  Pharmacy services, retail pharmacy and LTC pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries. We are currently subject to various litigation matters, investigations, audits, inspections, government inquiries, and regulatory and legal proceedings. Litigation, and particularly securities and collective or class action litigation, is often expensive and disruptive. Further, under the   qui tam   or  whistleblower  provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, private citizens may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of  false  claims to federal and/or state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters, and the costs incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, or we may be required to materially change our business practices, as a result of such proceedings. We refer you to Item 3,  Legal Proceedings  for additional information. 
    
  The foregoing is not a comprehensive listing of all possible risks and there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting the business. As such, we refer you to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  which includes our  Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements  at the end of such section, of our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015, which section is incorporated by reference herein.

PART II 
    
    Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
    
  Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  CVS.  The table below sets forth the high and low closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the quarterly cash dividends declared per share of common stock during the periods indicated. 

CVS Health has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Company s Board of Directors. As of February 3, 2016, there were 22,646 registered shareholders according to the records maintained by our transfer agent. 
    
  The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2014 Repurchase Program may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. The 2013 and 2012 Repurchase Programs have been completed, as described below. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a   $725 million   fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ). Upon payment of the   $725 million   purchase price on December 14, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR or approximately   6.2 million   shares. The initial   6.2 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in December 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $580 million and a forward contract for $145 million. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet. On January 28, 2016, the Company received   1.4 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   1.4 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in January 2016 and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2013 Repurchase Programs, effective January 2, 2015, the Company entered into a   $2.0 billion   fixed dollar ASR agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( JP Morgan ). Upon payment of the   $2.0 billion   purchase price on January 5, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately   16.8 million   shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2015. On May 1, 2015, the Company received approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   3.1 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by JP Morgan were placed into treasury stock in May 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for   $1.6 billion   and a forward contract for   $0.4 billion  . The forward contract was classified as  
    27 

an equity instrument and was initially recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet and was reclassified to treasury stock upon the settlement of the ASR in May 2015.  
    
  Each of the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude each ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.  
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repurchased an aggregate of   48.0 million   shares of common stock for approximately   $5.0 billion   under the 2013 and 2014 Repurchase Programs. As of December 31, 2015, there remained an aggregate of approximately   $7.7 billion   available for future repurchases under the 2014 Repurchase Program and the 2013 Repurchase Program was complete.

    Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures:   The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2015, have concluded that as of such date the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective at a reasonable assurance level and designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries would be made known to such officers on a timely basis. 
    
  Internal control over financial reporting:   We refer you to  Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  and  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  of our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which are incorporated by reference herein, for management s report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting and the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm s report with respect to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting:   On August 18, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Omnicare. On December 16, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. In conducting our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we have currently elected to exclude Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target from our evaluation for fiscal year 2015, as permitted under SEC rules. We are in the process of integrating the historical internal controls over financial reporting of Omnicare and the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses with the rest of the Company. Omnicare and the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses are included in the Company's 2015 consolidated financial statements and represent 18% of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2% of net revenues for the year then ended. 
    
  Other than the foregoing, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ARTICLE I    INTRODUCTION 
     CVS Health Corporation (the  Company ) hereby adopts the CVS Health Deferred Stock Compensation Plan as amended and restated as of October 1, 2015 (the  Plan ). 
     The purpose of the Plan is to provide certain eligible employees of the Company or an Affiliate authorized by the Committee to participate in the Plan with the opportunity to elect to defer receipt of shares of Stock under certain Stock-based compensation plans or arrangements. 
             1.3 
      Top Hat  Pension Benefit Plan. 
     The Plan is an  employee pension benefit plan  within the meaning of ERISA. However, the Plan is unfunded and maintained for a select group of management or highly compensated employees and, therefore, it is intended that the Plan will be exempt from Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA. The Plan is not intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code. 
     The Plan is unfunded. All benefits will be paid from the general assets of the Company. Participants in the Plan shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company. 
     The Plan was originally effective as of September 10, 1997, and amended and restated in its entirety effective as of October 1, 2015 to reflect certain design and administrative changes desired by the Company. 
     The Plan shall be administered by the Deferred Compensation Plans Committee, as defined in Article VII. 
     Wherever appropriate herein, words used in the singular shall be considered to include the plural and words used in the plural shall be considered to include the singular. The masculine gender, where appearing in the Plan, shall be deemed to include the feminine gender. The feminine gender, where appearing in the Plan, shall be deemed to include the masculine gender. 
     The headings of Articles and Sections herein are included solely for convenience, and if there is any conflict between such headings and the text of the Plan, the text shall control. 
      
    ARTICLE II    DEFINITIONS

              (a) 
    An Employee who is an Executive on October 1   st    of a calendar year (or such other date in the calendar year as designated by the Committee) shall be  eligible to participate in the Plan. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, designate other key employees of the Company or an Affiliate who are members of a select group of management or highly compensated employees as eligible to participate in the Plan. 
              (b) 
    Notwithstanding any Plan provision to the contrary, Employees must also be subject to the income tax laws of the United States in order to be eligible for participation in the Plan. 
              (c) 
    Subject to the provisions of Sections 3.3 and Section 4.1, an Eligible Executive shall remain eligible to continue participation in the Plan for each Plan Year following his or her initial year of participation in the Plan. 
                3.2 
    Commencement of Participation. 
     An Eligible Executive shall become a Participant effective as of the date that the Eligible Executive s first Deferred Stock Compensation Election becomes effective, provided that the Eligible Executive has provided such information as the Plan Administrator deems necessary to properly administer the Plan. 
             3.3 
    Termination of Participation. 
              (a)

              (b) 
    Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, a Participant shall only be eligible to make Deferred Stock Compensation Elections under the Plan for as long as he or she remains an Eligible Executive. 
              (c) 
    If a former Participant who has incurred a Termination of Employment with the Company and all Affiliates and whose participation in the Plan ceased under Section 3.3(a) is reemployed as an Executive, the former Participant may again become eligible to participate in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1.

In addition to any terms and conditions of deferral set forth under plans, programs or arrangements from which receipt of the Stock-denominated award is deferred, the Committee may impose limitations on the amounts permitted to be deferred and other terms and conditions of deferrals under the Plan.  Any such limitations, and other terms and conditions of deferral, shall be set forth in the rules relating to the Plan or election forms, other forms, or instructions published by the Committee and/or the Plan Administrator.

4.2 
    Filing Requirements of Deferred Stock Compensation Elections. 
     Subject to the following provisions of this Section, during an annual enrollment period established by the Plan Administrator in any Plan Year, an Eligible Executive described in Section 3.1 may elect, subject to Section 4.1 above, to defer Stock-denominated awards by submitting a Deferred Stock Compensation Election during such annual enrollment period.  Under no circumstances may a Participant defer Stock-denominated awards to which the Participant has attained, at the time of deferral, a legally enforceable right to current receipt of such Stock-denominated awards.   
  A Participant shall submit a Deferred Stock Compensation Election in the manner specified by the Plan Administrator and a Deferred Stock Compensation Election that is not timely filed shall be considered void and have no effect. If a Participant does not file a Deferred Stock Compensation Election applicable to his or her stock-denominated awards on or before the close of the applicable annual enrollment period (or such later date prescribed by the Plan Administrator), the Participant shall be deemed to have elected not to make a Deferred Stock Compensation Election for such awards.  
  Subject to the provisions of this Article, an Eligible Executive must file a new Deferred Stock Compensation Election for each award he or she elects to defer. 
             4.3 
    Modification or Revocation of Election by Participant. 
              (a) 
    Once a properly completed Deferred Stock Compensation Election form is received by the Company, the elections of the Participant shall be irrevocable:   provided however  , that subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee and/or Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, permit a Participant to elect a further deferral of amounts credited to a Deferral Account by filing a later election form in accordance with Section 6.7, below.  
              (b) 
    If a Participant ceases to be an Executive after the date a Deferred Stock Compensation Election becomes effective but continues to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate, he or she shall continue to be a Participant and his or her Deferred Stock Compensation Election currently in effect shall remain in force, but such Participant shall not be eligible to make any further Deferred Stock Compensation Elections until such time as he or she shall once again become an Eligible Executive. 
         
    ARTICLE V    DEFERRAL ACCOUNTS 
             5.1 
    Establishment; Crediting of Amounts Deferred. 
     One or more Deferral Accounts will be established for each Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator.  The amount of Stock-denominated awards deferred with respect to each Deferral Account will be credited to such Account as of the date on which such amounts would have been paid to the Participant but for the Participant s election to defer receipt hereunder.  Unless otherwise determined by the Plan Administrator, shares will be credited to the Participant s Deferral Account as units of Deferred Stock (as opposed to cash amounts valued by reference to the market price of Stock).  With respect to any fractional shares of Stock-denominated awards, the Plan Administrator shall either pay such fractional shares to the Participant in cash, credit the Deferral Account with cash in lieu of depositing fractional shares into the Deferral Account, or credit the Deferral Account with a fraction of a share calculated to at least three decimal places, as determined by the Plan Administrator. 
             5.2

       Page | 11  

Amounts credited as Deferred Stock to a Participant s Deferral Account may not be reallocated or deemed reinvested in any other investment vehicle, but shall remain as Deferred Stock until such time as the Deferral Account is settled in accordance with Article VI. 
             5.3 
    Dividend Equivalents.   
     Except as provided in Section 5.4, dividend equivalents will be credited on Deferred Stock credited to a Participant s Deferral Account as follows: 
           (a) 
    Cash and Non-Stock Dividends  .  If the Company declares and pays a dividend on Stock in the form of cash or property other than shares of Stock, then a number of additional shares of Deferred Stock shall be credited to a Participant s Deferral Account as of the payment date for such dividend equal to (A) the number of shares of Deferred Stock credited to the Deferral Account as of the record date for such dividend, multiplied by (B) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property other than shares actually paid as a dividend on each share at such payment date, divided by (C) the fair market value of a share of Stock at such payment date. 
              (b) 
    Stock Dividends and Splits  .  If the Company declares and pays a dividend on Stock in the form of additional shares of Stock, or there occurs a forward split of Stock, then a number of additional shares of Deferred Stock shall be credited to the Participant s Deferral Account as of the payment date for such dividend or forward Stock split equal to (A) the number of shares of Deferred Stock credited to the Deferral Account as of the record date for such dividend or split, multiplied by (B) the number of additional shares actually paid as a dividend or issued in such split in respect of each share of Stock. 
        The Committee may, in its discretion, establish one or more Trusts (including sub-accounts under such Trusts) and deposit therein shares of Stock equal in number to the number of shares of Deferred Stock then credited to a Participant s Deferral Account (or a specified subaccount). In such case, the provisions of Section 5.3 notwithstanding, the dividend equivalents payable on the Participant s Deferred Stock shall be equal to the actual dividends paid on the shares deposited in such Trust (which dividends shall be reinvested by the Trustee in additional shares of Stock), and shares may be delivered in settlement of the Participant s Deferred Stock from the assets in such Trusts.  The Participant s rights with respect to directing the voting of shares held in such Trust or otherwise relating to such shares shall be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion.

i. 
    Retirement  .  The distribution of the portion of a Participant s Deferral Account (or subaccount(s)) that is deferred to Retirement under this Section shall commence on the first business day in the January next following his or her Retirement, pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6, provided, however, that with respect to a Participant who is a Specified Employee as of the date of his or her Retirement, payment of any portion of his or her Deferral Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) that is subject to Section 409A of the Code will be delayed until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date such Retirement occurs. 
              ii. 
    S  pecific Future Year  . In the event a Participant elects to have the distribution of such deferrals made or commence as of a Specific Future Year, subject to rules established by the Plan Administrator, the deferral period must be at least five (5) Plan Years. The distribution of the portion of a Participant s Deferral Account (or subaccount(s)) that is deferred to a Specific Future Year shall commence on the first business day of January in that specific year pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6. 
                6.2 
    Disability Distributions. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant has a Termination of Employment because he or she has become Disabled, as determined by the Plan Administrator, such Participant will receive his or her entire Deferral Account in a single lump sum payment (including a Deferral Account with respect to which one or more installment payments have previously been made) which shall be made within seventy-five (75) days from the date of the Participant s Termination of Employment. 
             6.3 
    Distributions in the Event of Death. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Participant s death, the Participant s Beneficiary will receive a single lump sum payment in settlement of any Deferral Account (including a Deferral Account with respect to which one or more installment payments have previously been made) which shall be made within seventy-five (75) days following death.  
             6.4 
    Distributions Upon Termination of Employment Other Than Retirement, Death or Disability.  
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment from the Company and all Affiliates for any reason other than Retirement, death or Disability, said Participant will receive his or her entire Deferral Account in a single lump sum payment (including a Deferral Account with respect to which one or more installment payments have previously been made).  Such payment shall be made within seventy-five (75) days of the date the Participant s Termination of Employment occurs; provided, however, that with respect to a Participant who is a Specified Employee as of the date of his or her Termination of Employment for reasons other than death, payment of any portion of his or her Deferral Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.4 will be delayed until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date such Termination of Employment occurs. 
     Payments in settlement of any Deferral Account (including a Deferral Account with respect to which one or more installment payments have previously been made) shall be made in a single lump sum within forty-five (45) business days following a Change in Control. 
              (a) 
    Installments  .  Substantially equal annual installments, as elected by the Participant, from two (2) to ten (10) years. The initial installment of an annual payment stream will begin as of the first business day of the January (a) next following the Participant s date of Retirement  
       Page | 13  

or (b) of the Specific Future Year, as the case may be. Subsequent annual payments will be as of the first business day of each subsequent calendar year of the installment period. Each installment will be equal to a fraction of the Account balance (or subaccount(s) thereof) as of the date the installment is paid, with the numerator of the fraction being  1  and the denominator being the number of payments remaining in the payment schedule. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), if a Participant dies before receiving payment of the entire balance of his or her Deferral Account under the provisions of this Section, the remaining value of such Accounts shall be payable to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.8. 
           (b) 
    Lump sum  .  A Participant may elect distribution in the form of a single lump sum payment.  Except for Specified Employees, distribution shall be made as of the first business day of the January (a) next following the Participant s date of Retirement or (b) of the Specific Future Year, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of set forth in Section 6.1. 
              (c) 
    Distributions to a Participant made pursuant to Section 6.1 will occur pursuant to the Participant s payment elections at the time he or she submits the applicable Deferred Stock Compensation Election. A Participant may choose different forms of payment with respect to each Deferred Stock Compensation Election. In the absence of an election of the form of payment by a Participant on a Deferred Stock Compensation Election, the portion of the Participant s Account deferred pursuant to that Deferred Stock Compensation Election, adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Article V, shall be paid in a single lump sum. 
              (d) 
    A Participant shall not change his or her form of payment election, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7 below. 
                6.7 
    Change of Distribution Election. 
              (a) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to change his or her Specific Future Year election under Section 6.1(a)(ii) with respect to a portion of his or her Deferral Account to a later Specific Future Year by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new Specific Future Year election applicable to such Deferrals, subject to the following limitations: 
              i. 
    such election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the Specific Future Year then in effect with respect to that portion of his or her Deferral or Account (or subaccount(s) thereof), and such election will not become effective until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made; and 
              ii. 
    the new Specific Future Year shall be a calendar year that is not less than five (5) years from the Specific Future Year then in effect. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may elect to delay his or her distribution from an elected Specific Future Year to the later of Retirement or a new Specific Future Year that is at least five (5) years from the Specific Future Year then in effect, provided the election is made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7(a). A Participant may elect to delay his or her distribution from an elected Specific Future Year pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) more than once, provided that all such elections comply with the provisions of this Section 6.7(a). 
           (b) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to delay the payment of a portion of his or her Deferral Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) scheduled to be paid at his or her Retirement to his or her Retirement plus five  
       Page | 14  

(5) calendar years by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new Retirement election applicable to such deferrals; provided, however such election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to Retirement and shall not become effective until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made. 
           (c) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to change the form of payment election under Section 6.6 applicable to his or her distribution under Section 6.1(a)(i) or (ii) by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new form of payment election applicable to such deferrals, subject to the following limitations: 
              i. 
    such election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the Specific Future Year then in effect with respect to that portion of his or her Deferral Account (or subaccount(s) thereof), and such election will not become effective until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made; and 
              ii. 
    the distribution of that portion of his or her Deferral Account (or subaccount(s) thereof) shall be deferred for five (5) years from the date such amount would otherwise have been paid absent this election. 
              (d) 
    It is the Company's intent that the provisions of Sections 6.7(a), (b) and (c) comply with the subsequent election provisions in Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code, related regulations and other applicable guidance, and this Section 6.7 shall be interpreted accordingly. The Plan Administrator may impose additional restrictions or conditions on a Participant's ability to make an election pursuant to this Section 6.7. For avoidance of doubt, a Participant may not elect to alter the distribution of any portion of his or her Deferral Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) from Retirement to a Specific Future Year or, except as provided in paragraph (a) above, from a Specific Future Year to Retirement. 
                6.8 
    Designation of Beneficiary. 
     Each Participant shall have the right to designate a Beneficiary to receive payment of his or her Account in the event of death. Any such designation may be changed at any time by executing and submitting (either by hand or electronic submission) a new designation on a form prescribed by the Plan Administrator. 
     If the Plan Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary to whom an Account is payable, such Account may be forfeited to the Company upon the Plan Administrator s determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if subsequent to any such forfeiture, the Participant or Beneficiary to whom such Account is payable makes a valid claim, such forfeited Account shall be restored to the Plan and paid by the Company. 
     To the extent that Stock (i) is deposited in a Trust pursuant to Section 5.4 in connection with a deferral of a Stock-denominated award under any plan, program, employment agreement or other arrangement and (ii) is forfeited pursuant to the terms of such plan, program, agreement or arrangement, the Participant shall not be entitled to the value of such Stock and other property related thereto (including without limitation, dividends thereon) or other award or amount, or proceeds thereof.  Any Stock forfeited shall be returned to the Company. 

Page | 15  

A Participant may apply in writing to the Plan Administrator for, and the Plan Administrator may grant, a hardship withdrawal of all or any part of a Participant s Deferral Account if the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that the Participant has incurred an Unforeseeable Emergency, as defined in the Universal 409A Definition Document. 
  The Plan Administrator shall determine whether an event qualifies as a hardship within this Section, in its sole and absolute discretion. Such request shall be made in a time and manner determined by the Plan Administrator. The payment made from a Participant s Deferral Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall not be in excess of the amount necessary to meet such financial hardship of the Participant, including amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or local income taxes with respect to the payment and shall not be available unless all other financial resources of the Participant have been exhausted. Payment shall be made in the month following the date the Plan Administrator determines that the Participant has incurred an unforeseeable severe financial hardship and grants the right to a withdrawal pursuant to this Section 6.10. 
             6.12 
    Distribution of Grandfathered Deferral Account. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VI, the distribution from a Participant s Grandfathered Deferral Account (or subaccount(s)) shall be made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan as set forth on October 3, 2004, without regard to any amendments after October 3, 2004 which would constitute a material modification for Section 409A of the Code, as modified in Appendix A attached hereto. 
     The Company shall settle a Participant s Deferral Account, and discharge all of its obligations to pay deferred compensation under the Plan with respect to such Deferral Account, by delivery of shares of Stock, including shares of Stock delivered out of the assets of any Trust. 
     In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Stock, or other property), recapitalization, forward or reverse split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Stock such that an adjustment is determined by the Administrator or the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of a Participant s rights under the Plan, then the Plan Administrator or the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of the number and kind of shares of Stock to be issued upon settlement of Deferred Stock then credited to a Deferral Account under the Plan. 
      
    ARTICLE VII     ADMINISTRATION 
     The Plan shall be administered by the Deferred Compensation Plans Committee, appointed by the Committee as Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall be responsible for the general operation and administration of the Plan and for carrying out the provisions thereof.

7.2 
    General Powers of Administration. 
     The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive responsibility and complete discretionary authority to control the operation, management and administration of the Plan, with all powers necessary to enable it properly to carry out such responsibilities, including, but not limited to, the power to interpret the Plan and any related documents, to establish procedures for making any elections called for under the Plan, to make factual determinations regarding any and all matters arising hereunder, including, but not limited to, the right to determine eligibility for benefits, the right to construe the terms of the Plan, the right to remedy possible  ambiguities, inequities, inconsistencies or omissions, and the right to resolve all interpretive, equitable or other questions arising under the Plan.

The Plan Administrator shall have all powers necessary or appropriate to enable it to carry out its administrative duties. Not in limitation, but in application of the foregoing, the Plan Administrator shall have the duty and power to interpret the Plan and determine all questions that may raise hereunder as to the status and rights of Employees, Participants, Beneficiaries, and any other person. The Plan Administrator may exercise the powers hereby granted in its sole and absolute discretion. No member of the Deferred Compensation Plans Committee shall be personally liable for any actions taken by the Plan Administrator unless the member s action involves gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
             7.3 
    Costs of Administration. 
     The costs of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company unless and until the Participant receives written notice of the imposition of such administrative costs; with such costs to begin with the next Plan Year and none may be assessed retroactively for prior Plan Years. 
  Such costs shall be charged against the Participant s Account and shall be uniform or proportional for all Participants. Such costs shall not exceed the standard rates for similarly designed nonqualified plans under administration by high quality third party administrators at the time such costs are initially imposed and thereafter. 
     The Company shall indemnify each director, officer or employee of the Company or any Affiliate and each member of the Committee and Deferred Compensation Plans Committee, including any subcommittee or delegates thereof, against any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses, including attorney s fees, incurred by them, and any liability, including any amounts paid in settlement with their approval, arising from their action or failure to act, except when the same is judicially determined to be attributable to their gross negligence or willful misconduct, as a result of the fact that he or she is or was serving the Plan in any capacity at the request of the Company.

Regardless of, and superseding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if any provision of the Plan would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this conflict. With respect to a Participant who is a Specified Employee as of the date of his or her Termination of Employment for reasons other than death, payment of any amounts subject to Section 409A of the Code on account of his or her Termination of Employment will be delayed until the first day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date such Termination of Employment occurs.

7.6 
    Sources of Stock: Limitation on Amount of Stock-Denominated Deferrals.    
     If shares of Stock are deposited under the Plan in a Trust pursuant to Section 5.4 in connection with a deferral of a Stock-denominated award under another plan, program, employment agreement or other arrangement that provides for the issuance of shares, the shares so deposited shall be deemed to have originated, and shall be counted against the number of shares reserved, under such other plan, program or arrangement.  Shares of Stock actually delivered in settlement of Deferral Accounts shall be originally issued shares or treasury shares, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator. 
      
    ARTICLE VIII    CLAIMS PROCEDURE 
     A person who believes that he or she is being denied a benefit to which he or she is entitled under the Plan (hereinafter referred to as a  Claimant ) may file a written request for such benefit with the Plan Administrator, setting forth his or her claim. The request must be addressed to the Senior Vice President, Compensation and Benefits, at the Company s then principal place of business. 
     Upon receipt of a claim, the Plan Administrator or its delegate shall review and determine the claim within ninety (90) days. If the Plan Administrator determines that additional time is needed to review the claim, the Plan Administrator will provide the Claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial ninety (90)-day period. The notice of extension will provide the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make a decision. 
  If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant in writing of the following: 
           (a) 
    The reason or reasons for such denial; 
              (b) 
    The pertinent provisions of the Plan; 
              (c) 
    Appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the Claimant wishes to submit the claim for review; and 
              (d) 
    The time limits for requesting a review under this Section. 
                8.3 
    Request for Review/Appeal. 
     Within sixty (60) days after the receipt by the Claimant of the initial written notice of a denial, the Claimant may request in writing that the initial determination be reviewed. Such request must be addressed to the Senior Vice President, Compensation and Benefits, at the Company s then principal place of business. The Claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may, but need not, submit issues and comments in writing for consideration by the Appeals Committee, a subcommittee of the Deferred Compensation Plans Committee.  If the Claimant does not request a review of the initial determination within such sixty (60)-day period, he or she shall be barred and stopped from challenging the Plan Administrator s initial determination. 
     Within sixty (60) days after the Plan Administrator s receipt of a request for review, the Appeals Committee of the Plan Administrator will review the Plan Administrator s initial determination. After considering all materials presented by the Claimant, the Appeals Committee will render a written decision, setting forth the reasons for the decision and containing references to the pertinent  
    Page | 18  

provisions of the Plan. If the Appeals Committee requires an extension of the sixty (60)-day time period, the Appeals Committee will so notify the Claimant and will render the decision as soon as possible, but no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request for review. 
             8.5

    ARTICLE IX    MISCELLANEOUS 
             9.1 
    Not Contract of Employment. 
     The adoption and maintenance of the Plan shall not be deemed to be a contract between the Company or an Affiliate and any person and shall not be consideration for the employment of any person. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate or to restrict the right of the Company or an Affiliate to discharge any person at any time nor shall the Plan be deemed to give the Company or an Affiliate the right to require any person to remain in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate or to restrict any person s right to terminate his or her employment at any time. 
             9.2 
    Non-Assignability of Benefits. 
     No Participant, Beneficiary or distributees of benefits under the Plan shall have any power or right to transfer, assign, anticipate, hypothecate or otherwise encumber any part or all of the amounts payable hereunder, which are expressly declared to be unassignable and nontransferable. Any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void. No amount payable hereunder shall, prior to actual payment thereof, be subject to seizure by any creditor of any such Participant, Beneficiary or other distributees for the payment of any debt judgment or other obligation, by a proceeding at law or in equity, nor transferable by operation of law in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency or death of such Participant, Beneficiary or other distributee hereunder. 
     Payments (in any form) to any Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims for any compensation deferred, or otherwise relating to any Deferral Account, under the Plan against the Company or any subsidiary thereof, the Committee, or the Plan Administrator.  In the case of any payment under the Plan of less than all amounts then credited to a Deferral Account in the form of Stock, the amounts paid shall be deemed to relate to the Stock credited to the account at the earliest time. 
             9.4 
    Withholding and Deduction and Taxes.  
     All deferrals and payments provided for hereunder shall be subject to applicable withholding and other deductions as shall be required of the Company under any applicable local, state or federal law. The Company may require that the Participant or Beneficiary making a deferral or receiving payments pay to the Company the amount of any federal, state or local taxes, if any, that the Company or any Affiliate is required to withhold with respect to such deferrals or payments or the Company or any Affiliate may deduct from other wages paid by the Company or any Affiliate the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such deferrals or payments.  A Participant or Beneficiary shall be solely responsible for any tax consequences related to deferrals or payments made under the Plan.  The Company shall have no obligation to make any payment under the Plan until the Company s or any Affiliate s tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant or Beneficiary.

9.5 
    Amendment and Termination. 
     The Committee or its delegate may from time to time, in its discretion, amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan; provided, however, that no amendment may be made that would impair the rights of a Participant with respect to amounts already allocated to his or her Account without the Participant s consent. To the extent consistent with the rules relating to plan terminations and liquidations in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) or otherwise consistent with Section 409A of the Code, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may terminate the Plan and any related Deferred Stock Compensation Election at any time and in that event the Committee may provide that, without the prior written consent of Participants, the Participants  Accounts shall be distributed in a single lump sum in shares. In the event of a Plan termination, the distribution of a Participant s Grandfathered Deferral Account shall be made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan as set forth on October 3, 2004, without regard to any amendments after October 3, 2004 which would constitute a material modification for Section 409A of the Code, as modified in Appendix A attached hereto. 
             9.6 
    Compliance with Securities and Other Laws. 
     Notwithstanding any Plan provision to the contrary, the Committee may at any time impose such restrictions on the Plan and participation therein, including limiting the amount of any deferral or the timing thereof, as the Committee may deem advisable from time to time in order to comply or preserve compliance with any applicable laws, including any applicable state and federal securities laws and exemptions from registration available thereunder. 
  The Company shall impose such restrictions on Stock delivered to a Participant hereunder and any other interest constituting a security as it may deem advisable in order to comply with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Stock is then listed or quoted, any applicable state securities laws, any provision of the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or any other law, regulation, or binding contract to which the Company is a party. 
             9.7 
    Provisions Relating to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  
     With respect to a Participant who is then subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Committee and Plan Administrator shall implement transactions under the Plan and administer the Plan in a manner that will ensure that each transaction by such a Participant is exempt from or otherwise not subject to liability under Rule 16b-3, except that such a Participant may be permitted to engage in a non-exempt transaction under the Plan if written notice is given to the Participant regarding the  non-exempt nature of such transaction. 
     Nothing contained in the Plan and no action taken pursuant to its provisions by the Company or any person, shall create, nor be construed to create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant, Beneficiary, or any other person. 
             9.9 
    Unsecured General Creditor Status of Employee. 
     The Plan is intended to constitute an  unfunded  plan for deferred compensation and Participants shall rely solely on the unsecured promise of the Company for payment hereunder.  With respect to any payment not yet made to a Participant under the Plan, nothing contained in the Plan shall give a Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company; provided, however, that the Committee may authorize the creation of Trusts, including but not limited to the Trusts referred to in Section 5.4 hereof, or make other arrangements to meet the Company s obligations under the Plan, which Trusts or other arrangements shall be consistent with the  unfunded  status of the Plan unless the Committee otherwise determines with the consent of each affected Participant. 
  No Participant shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company under the Plan, including as a result of the crediting of Stock-denominated units or other amounts to a Deferral  
    Page | 20  

Account, or the creation of any Trust and deposit of such Stock therein, except at such time as Stock may be actually delivered to the Participant in settlement of a Deferral Account.   
     A Participant and his or her Beneficiary shall assume all risk in connection with any decrease in value of the Deferral Account, and neither the     Company nor the Committee or the Plan Administrator shall be liable or responsible therefor. 
             9.11 
    Payment to Minors and Incompetents. 
     If any Participant, spouse, or Beneficiary entitled to receive any benefits hereunder is a minor or is deemed by the Plan Administrator or is adjudicated to be legally incapable of giving a valid receipt and discharge for such benefits, the benefits will be paid to the person or entity as the Plan Administrator determines has been appointed or established to receive such payment on behalf of such person.

Section 1.409A- 2(b)(7) and any subsequent guidance. 
     If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof; instead, each provision shall be fully severable and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein. 
     All provisions of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Rhode Island, except to the extent preempted by federal law. 
     The terms of the Plan shall be binding on each Participant and his or her heirs and legal representatives and on the Company and its successors and assigns.

ARTICLE I    INTRODUCTION 
     CVS Health Corporation (the  Company ) hereby adopts the CVS Health Deferred Compensation Plan as amended and restated as of October 1, 2015 (the  Plan ). 
     The purpose of the Plan is to provide certain eligible employees of the Company or an Affiliate authorized by the Committee to participate in the Plan the opportunity to defer elements of his or her compensation which might not otherwise be deferrable under other plans maintained by the Company or an Affiliate and to make deferrals and receive contributions that would be obtainable under the 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan of CVS Health Corporation and Affiliated Companies ( Future Fund ) in the absence of certain restrictions and limitations in the Internal Revenue Code.

     Top Hat  Pension Benefit Plan. 
     The Plan is an  employee pension benefit plan  within the meaning of ERISA.

The Plan is not intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code. 
     The Plan is unfunded. All benefits will be paid from the general assets of the Company. Participants in the Plan shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company. 
     The Plan was originally effective as of January 1, 1997, and amended and restated in its entirety effective as of December 31, 2008, to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder and as of December 17, 2014 and October 1, 2015 to reflect certain design and administrative changes desired by the Company. 
     The Plan shall be administered by the Deferred Compensation Plans Committee, as defined in Article VII. 
     Wherever appropriate herein, words used in the singular shall be considered to include the plural and words used in the plural shall be considered to include the singular. The masculine gender, where appearing in the Plan, shall be deemed to include the feminine gender. The feminine gender, where appearing in the Plan, shall be deemed to include the masculine gender. 
     The headings of Articles and Sections herein are included solely for convenience, and if there is any conflict between such headings and the text of the Plan, the text shall control.

ARTICLE IV    DEFERRALS   COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS 
              (a) 
    Subject to the following provisions of this Article IV, an Eligible Executive may defer for any Plan Year, (i) up to fifty percent (50%) of Base Salary otherwise earned and payable in that Plan Year, and/or (ii) up to one hundred percent (100%) of Annual Cash Incentive otherwise earned in that Plan Year and payable in that Plan Year or in the first calendar quarter of the following Plan Year, and/or (iii) up to one hundred percent (100%) of Commissions otherwise earned in that Plan Year and payable in that Plan Year or in the first calendar quarter of the following Plan Year. The Plan Administrator may, as it deems appropriate, establish maximum or minimum limits on the amounts which may be deferred for a Plan Year and/or the times of such Deferred Compensation Elections.  An Eligible Executive shall be given advance notice of any such limits. 
              (b) 
    Deferrals under the Plan shall be calculated with respect to the gross cash compensation payable to the Participant prior to any deductions (e.g., 401(k) deferrals) or withholdings. However, the Deferrals shall be reduced by the Plan Administrator as necessary if it is later determined, after Deferrals are made under the Plan and after additional deduction of all required income and employment taxes, 401(k) and other employee benefit deductions, and other deductions required by law, that all such total deferrals will exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the cash compensation of the Participant available under Section 4.1(a). Changes to payroll withholdings that affect the amount of compensation being deferred to the Plan shall be allowed only to the extent permissible under Section 409A of the Code. 
                4.2 
    Filing Requirements of Deferred Compensation Elections. 
     Subject to the following provisions of this Section, during an annual enrollment period established by the Plan Administrator in any Plan Year, an Eligible Executive described in Section 3.1 may elect, subject to Section 4.1 above, to defer a portion of his or her Base Salary that is otherwise earned and payable in the next Plan Year and/or all or a portion of his or her Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions otherwise earned in the next Plan Year and payable in that Plan Year or in the first calendar quarter of the subsequent Plan Year by submitting a Deferred Compensation Election during such annual enrollment period.  If an Executive becomes an Eligible Executive after October 1 (or such later date as prescribed by the Plan Administrator) in any calendar year, he or she may not make a Deferred Compensation Election for Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions earned in the next Plan Year. 
  A Participant shall submit a Deferred Compensation Election in the manner specified by the Plan Administrator and a Deferred Compensation Election that is not timely filed shall be considered void and have no effect. If a Participant does not file a Deferred Compensation Election applicable to his or her Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions earned in a Plan Year on or before the close of the applicable annual enrollment period (or such later date prescribed by the Plan Administrator), the Participant shall be deemed to have elected not to make a Deferred Compensation Election for such Plan Year. The Plan Administrator shall establish procedures that govern deferral elections under the Plan, including the ability to make separate elections for Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions, and any other cash remuneration payable to the Participant that the Committee or Plan Administrator permits a Participant to defer under the Plan. 
    Page |   12

    A Participant s Deferred Compensation Election for a Plan Year shall become irrevocable as of the close of business on the date established by the Plan Administrator, but not later than the last day of the calendar year preceding the Plan Year in which such Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions applicable to that election is earned, and shall become effective as of the first day of the Plan Year in which such Base Salary and/or Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions is earned. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator may cancel a Participant s Deferred Compensation Elections for the balance of a Plan Year if the Participant submits evidence of an unforeseeable emergency (as defined in the Universal 409A Definition Document) to the Plan Administrator. Any Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive, Commissions or other cash remuneration which would have been deferred pursuant to that cancelled Deferred Compensation Election shall be paid to the Eligible Executive as if he or she had not made that election. 
  A Participant may revoke or change a Deferred Compensation Election any time prior to the date such election becomes irrevocable. Any such change or revocation shall be made in a form and manner determined by the Plan Administrator. Under no circumstances may a Participant s Deferred Compensation Election be made, modified or revoked retroactively. 
           (b) 
    If a Participant s Deferred Compensation Election applicable to his or her Base Salary and/or Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions is cancelled for a Plan Year, he or she will not be permitted to elect to make Deferrals again until the next Plan Year. 
              (c) 
    If a Participant ceases to be an Executive after the date a Deferred Compensation Election becomes effective but continues to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate, he or she shall continue to be a Participant and his or her Deferred Compensation Election currently in effect shall remain in force, but such Participant shall not be eligible to make any further Deferred Compensation Elections until such time as he or she shall once again become an Eligible Executive. 
              (d) 
    Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if  an Eligible Executive: 
              i. 
    receives a withdrawal of deferred cash contributions on account of hardship from any plan which is maintained by the Company or an Affiliate and which meets the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code (or any successor thereto); and 
              ii. 
    is precluded from making contributions to such 401(k) plan for at least six (6) months after receipt of the hardship withdrawal, 
     the Eligible Executive s Deferred Compensation Election with respect to Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions in effect at that time shall be cancelled. Any Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions payment which would have been deferred pursuant to that Deferred Compensation Election but for the application of this Section 4.3(d) shall be paid to the Eligible Executive as if he or she had not made that election.

           (a) 
    Company Contributions - Restoration of Lost Matching Contribution  . The amount of Lost Matching Contributions credited under the Plan on a Participant s behalf each calendar year shall be equal to (i) minus (ii) where: 
              i. 
    is the total Qualified Future Fund Matching Contribution that would have been allocated on the Participant s behalf under Future Fund, without giving effect to any reductions or limitations required by Sections 401(a)(17), 401(k), 402(g) and/or 415 of the Code, for the Plan Year based on the aggregate of the Participant s Elective Deferrals to Future Fund, his or her deferrals to any other qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or an Affiliate, and his or her Deferral under Section 4.1 for the Plan Year, disregarding, in all cases, any deferrals made with respect to Base Salary, Annual Cash Incentives and Commissions otherwise payable prior to the first payroll period commencing in the month following date the Participant s completion of one (1) Year of Service; and 
              ii. 
    If the Participant is eligible to contribute to Future Fund (whether pre-tax or after-tax) during the Plan Year, the actual matching contributions made on the Participant s behalf to Future Fund or any other qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or any Affiliate for that Plan Year.  
     In addition, if the Participant is not eligible to contribute to Future Fund during the Plan Year but is eligible to contribute to another qualified defined contribution plan (whether pre-tax or after-tax) maintained by the Company or an Affiliate during that Plan Year, the amount under this clause (ii) shall equal, unless otherwise provided by the  Committee, the maximum amount of matching contributions the Participant would have received under the provisions of Future Fund for that Plan Year had he or she been eligible to contribute to Future Fund during that Plan Year, based on his or her Base Salary and/or Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions otherwise earned and payable in that Plan Year, and his or her contributions to such other qualified defined contribution plan for that Plan Year had been made to Future Fund. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining the Lost Matching Contributions to be credited under this Section 4.4(a), Years of Service with respect to a Participant employed by Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, the limited liability corporation formed pursuant to the Framework Agreement between CVS Pharmacy, Inc. and Cardinal Health 110 Inc., dated December 10, 2013 ( Cardinal ), who immediately prior to becoming employed by Red Oak Sourcing, LLC was employed by Cardinal, shall include the period of such Participant s employment rendered with Cardinal.

Such election shall be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Plan Administrator. The deferral election applicable to an LTIP cash award shall be made prior to the close of the calendar year preceding the first day of the performance period applicable to that award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such election shall become irrevocable as of the close of business of the last day of the calendar year preceding the first day of the performance period applicable to that award. However, if such award meets the definition of performance-based compensation (as defined under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(e) and any subsequent guidance), the Plan Administrator may permit such election to be made in accordance with the provisions under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2(a)(8) and subsequent guidance.

(c) 
    Cash Retention Award Deferrals. 
     At the sole discretion of the Committee and subject to the procedures established by the Plan Administrator, an Eligible Executive may elect to defer all or a portion of a cash retention award that may be otherwise paid under a cash retention program maintained by the Company or an Affiliate. The deferral election applicable to such cash retention award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(a)(5). 
             4.5 
    Deferral and Contribution Timing. 
     Base Salary Deferrals will be credited to the Account of each Participant as of the date of the pay check from which the deferral was withheld.  A Participant whose employment terminates during a payroll period will cease deferral withholding effective as of the first day of the following payroll period. 
  Annual Cash Incentive Deferrals and Commission Deferrals will be credited to the Account of each Participant as of the day on which such Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions, whichever is applicable, otherwise would have been paid to the Participant in cash. 
  Company Contributions for the Restoration of Lost Matching Contribution pursuant to Section 4.4(a) above will generally be credited to the Participant s Company Account as of the day on which said Lost Matching Contribution would otherwise have been credited to the Participant s account under Future Fund (generally following one Year of Participation Service). 
  LTIP deferrals shall be credited to the Account of the Participant at the time designated by the Plan Administrator. 
  Cash retention awards Deferrals will be credited to the Account of the Participant as of the day on which such cash retention award otherwise would have been paid to the Participant in cash. 
      
    ARTICLE V    ACCOUNTS 
             5.1 
    Establishment of Bookkeeping Accounts. 
     Separate bookkeeping accounts shall be maintained for each Participant. Said accounts (or subaccount(s) thereof) shall be credited with the deferrals and contributions made by or on behalf of the Participant pursuant to the Plan and credited (or charged, as the case may be) with the hypothetical investment results determined pursuant to this Article of the Plan. 
     Within each Participant s bookkeeping account, separate subaccount(s) shall be maintained to the extent necessary for the administration of the Plan. Generally, subaccount(s) will be set up for each year, for each Deferred Compensation Election the Participant makes, and for the Company Contribution credited each year on behalf of a Participant. 
             5.3 
    Hypothetical Nature of Accounts. 
     The accounts established under this Article shall be hypothetical in nature and shall be maintained for bookkeeping purposes only so that hypothetical gains or losses on the deferrals or contributions made to the Plan can be credited (or charged, as the case may be). 
    Page |   15 

Neither the Plan nor any of the accounts, or subaccount(s), established hereunder shall hold any actual funds or assets. The right of any person to receive one or more payments under the Plan shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company. Any liability of the Company to any Participant, former Participant, or Beneficiary with respect to a right to payment shall be based solely upon contractual obligations created by the Plan. The Company, an Affiliate, the Board, the Committee, or any other person shall not be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship, between the Company, an Affiliate, the Board, the Committee, the Plan Administrator, or any other person and a Participant or any other person. 
     Deferral Account  . A Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested in his or her Deferral Account and Grandfathered Deferral Account at all times. A Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested in the LTIP deferrals credited on his or her behalf pursuant to Section 4.4(b) and any cash retention award deferrals credited on his or her behalf pursuant to Section 4.4(c). 
  Company Account  . A Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested in his or her Company Account and Grandfathered Company Account at all times. 
             5.5 
    Deferral Crediting Options. 
     Deferral Crediting Options are similar to investment choices in a qualified defined contribution plan, except that they are hypothetical in nature and no funds are actually held in the Plan. Deferral Crediting Options determine the hypothetical gain or loss to be reflected in the Participant Accounts and shall be elected by Participants in the manner determined by the Plan Administrator. 
  The Deferral Crediting Options offered to Participants are determined by the Plan Administrator at its sole discretion. The Plan Administrator specifically retains the right to change the Deferral Crediting Options at any time, in its sole discretion. 
  In the event the Plan Administrator designates more than one Deferral Crediting Option, each Participant shall electronically submit a Deferral Crediting Option election during each annual enrollment period, which shall be used to measure the hypothetical investment performance of his or her Accounts, within such time period and on such form as the Plan Administrator may prescribe. The designation of a Deferral Crediting Option shall not require the Company to invest or earmark their general assets in any manner. If a Participant fails to make a Deferral Crediting Option, his or her Accounts shall be deemed invested in a Deferral Crediting Option as determined by the Plan Administrator. 
  A Participant may change his or her election of a Deferral Crediting Option used to measure the hypothetical investment performance of his or her Account balance within such time periods and in such manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator. The election shall be effective as soon as administratively practicable after the date on which the election is submitted in the manner specified by the Plan Administrator. 
  Any amounts added to or subtracted from a Participant s Account on any given Valuation Date will be converted to hypothetical unit equivalents ( HypotheticalUnits ) with a value per Hypothetical Unit ( Unit Price ) based on the daily closing price on said date ( Unit Price ) for any given Deferral Crediting Option. 

Page |   16 

5.6    Hypothetical Gains or Losses. 
  Any hypothetical dividends, capital gains and any other income or unit activity will be reflected in the Deferral Crediting Options. The timing of these will be the same as for the funds on which each Deferral Crediting Option is based. 
  The gain or loss on Participant Accounts will be calculated each Valuation Date. The Unit Price shall determine each Deferral Crediting Option s hypothetical value, based on the number of units within the Account for any given Deferral Crediting Option. Account balances on a given day will be based on the previous day s New York Stock Exchange closing price.

              (b) 
    Company Contributions shall be distributed pursuant to the Participant s distribution election.

The second annual payment will be paid as of the first business day in January of the subsequent calendar year. 
             6.4 
    Distributions Upon Termination of Employment Other Than Retirement, Death or Disability.  
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment from the Company and all Affiliates for any reason other than Retirement, death or Disability, said Participant will receive his or her entire Deferral Account and Company Account balance in a single lump sum payment.  Such payment shall be made within seventy-five (75) days of the date  the Participant s Termination of Employment occurs; provided, however, that with respect to a Participant who is a Specified Employee as of the date of his or her Termination of Employment for reasons other than death, payment of any portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.4 will be delayed until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date such Termination of Employment occurs.

              (a) 
    Installments  .  Subject to the limitations set forth in Article VI,  distributions will be made in annual (or quarterly, if the election was made prior to October 1, 2008) installments, as elected by the Participant, for up to, and including, ten (10) years (fifteen (15) years for an election made prior to October 1, 2008). The initial installment of an annual or quarterly payment stream will begin as of the first business day of the January (a) next following the Participant s date of Retirement or (b) of the Specific Future Year, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of set forth in Section 6.1. Subsequent annual or quarterly payments will be as of the first business day of each subsequent calendar year or quarter of the installment period.  
     Each installment will be equal to a fraction of the Account balance (or subaccount(s) thereof) as of the date the installment is paid, with the numerator of the fraction being  1  and the denominator being the number of payments remaining in the payment schedule. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), if a Participant dies before receiving payment of the entire balance of his or her Deferral and Company Accounts under the provisions of this Section, the remaining value of such Accounts shall be payable to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.9. 
           (b) 
    Lump sum  .  A Participant may elect distribution in the form of a single lump sum payment.

A Participant may choose different forms of payment with respect to each Deferred Compensation Election. Company Contributions, adjusted pursuant to Article V, shall be distributed pursuant to the Participant s form of payment election made with respect to his or her Company Contributions for that year. If the Participant has not made an election with respect to his or her Company Contributions, the portion of his or her Company Account attributable to such Company contributions will be distributed in accordance with his or her form of payment election with respect to his or her Base Salary Deferral, Annual Cash Incentive or Commissions Deferrals for that year, if any, in that order; otherwise payment will be made in a lump sum payment. In the absence of an election of the form of payment by a Participant on a Deferred Compensation Election, the portion of the Participant s Account deferred pursuant to that Deferred Compensation Election, adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Article V, shall be paid in a single lump sum. 
              (d) 
    A Participant shall not change his or her form of payment election, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7 below. 
                6.7 
    Change of Distribution Election. 
              (a) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to change his or her Specific Future Year election under Section 6.1(a)(ii) with respect to a portion of his or her Deferral Account (or an Interim Distribution date election applicable to a portion of his or her Deferral Account or Company Account made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan as in effect prior to December 31, 2008) to a later Specific Future Year (or, if applicable, a later Interim Distribution date) by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new Specific Future Year election (or Interim Distribution date election) applicable to such Deferrals, subject to the following limitations: 
              i. 
    such election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the Specific Future Year (or Interim Distribution date) then in effect with respect to that portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or subaccount(s) thereof), and such election will not become effective until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made; and 
              ii. 
    the new Specific Future Year (or Interim Distribution date) shall be a calendar year that is not less than five (5) years from the Specific Future Year (or Interim Distribution date) then in effect. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may elect to delay his or her distribution from an elected Specific Future Year to the later of Retirement or a new Specific Future Year that is at least five (5) years from the Specific Future Year then in effect, provided the election is made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7(a). A Participant may elect to delay his or her distribution from an elected Specific Future Year (or Interim Distribution date) pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) more than once, provided that all such elections comply with the provisions of this Section 6.7(a). 
           (b) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to delay the payment of a portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) scheduled to be paid at his or her Retirement to his or her Retirement plus five (5) calendar years by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new Retirement election applicable to such deferrals; provided, however such election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to Retirement and shall not become effective until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made. 
              (c) 
    In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, a Participant may elect to change the form of payment election under Section 6.6 applicable to his or her distribution under Section 6.1(a)(i) or (ii) by duly completing, executing and filing with the Plan Administrator a new form of payment election applicable to such deferrals, subject to the following limitations:

              ii. 
    the distribution of that portion of his or her Deferral or Company Account (or subaccount(s) thereof) shall be deferred for five (5) years from the date such amount would otherwise have been paid absent this election. 
              (d) 
    It is the Company's intent that the provisions of Sections 6.7(a), (b) and (c) comply with the subsequent election provisions in Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code, related regulations  
       Page |   18 

and other applicable guidance, and this Section 6.7 shall be interpreted accordingly. The Plan Administrator may impose additional restrictions or conditions on a Participant's ability to make an election pursuant to this Section 6.7. For avoidance of doubt, a Participant may not elect to alter the distribution of any portion of his or her Deferral or Company Accounts (or any subaccount(s) thereof) from Retirement to a Specific Future Year or, except as provided in paragraph (a) above, from a Specific Future Year to Retirement. 
             6.8 
    Account Valuation upon a Distribution. 
     With respect to a distribution made pursuant to this Article, the Valuation Date of a Participant s Account shall be the day immediately preceding the Distribution Date. 
             6.9 
    Designation of Beneficiary. 
     Each Participant shall have the right to designate a Beneficiary to receive payment of his or her Account in the event of death. Any such designation may be changed at any time by executing and submitting (either by hand or electronic submission) a new designation on a form prescribed by the Plan Administrator. 
     If the Plan Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary to whom an Account is payable, such Account may be forfeited to the Company upon the Plan Administrator s determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if subsequent to any such forfeiture, the Participant or Beneficiary to whom such Account is payable makes a valid claim, such forfeited Account shall be restored to the Plan and paid by the Company. 
     A Participant may apply in writing to the Plan Administrator for, and the Plan Administrator may grant, a hardship withdrawal of all or any part of a Participant s Deferral or Company Account if the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that the Participant has incurred an Unforeseeable Emergency, as defined in the Universal 409A Definition Document. 
  The Plan Administrator shall determine whether an event qualifies as a hardship within this Section, in its sole and absolute discretion. Such request shall be made in a time and manner determined by the Plan Administrator. The payment made from a Participant s Deferral or Company Account (or any subaccount(s) thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall not be in excess of the amount necessary to meet such financial hardship of the Participant, including amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or local income taxes with respect to the payment and shall not be available unless all other financial resources of the Participant have been exhausted. Payment shall be made in the month following the date the Plan Administrator determines that the Participant has incurred an unforeseeable severe financial hardship and grants the right to a withdrawal pursuant to this Section 6.11. 
             6.12 
    Distribution of Grandfathered Deferral Account and the Grandfathered Company Account. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VI, the distribution from a Participant s Grandfathered Deferral Account and Grandfathered Company Account (or subaccount(s)) shall be made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan as set forth on October 3, 2004, without regard to any amendments after October 3, 2004 which would constitute a material modification for Section 409A of the Code, as modified in Appendix A attached hereto. 
      
    ARTICLE VII     ADMINISTRATION 
     The Plan shall be administered by the Deferred Compensation Plans Committee, appointed by the Committee as Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall be responsible for the general operation and administration of the Plan and for carrying out the provisions thereof.

             7.2 
    General Powers of Administration. 
     The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive responsibility and complete discretionary authority to control the operation, management and administration of the Plan, with all powers necessary to enable it properly to carry out such responsibilities, including, but not limited to, the power to interpret the Plan and any related documents, to establish procedures for making any elections called for under the Plan, to make factual determinations regarding any and all matters arising hereunder, including, but not limited to, the right to determine eligibility for benefits, the right to construe the terms of the Plan, the right to remedy possible  ambiguities, inequities, inconsistencies or omissions, and the right to resolve all interpretive, equitable or other questions arising under the Plan.

    Not Contract of Employment. 
     The adoption and maintenance of the Plan shall not be deemed to be a contract between the Company or an Affiliate and any person and shall not be consideration for the employment of any person. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate or to restrict the right of the Company or an Affiliate to discharge any person at any time nor shall the Plan be deemed to give the Company or an Affiliate the right to require any person to remain in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate or to restrict any person s right to terminate his or her employment at any time. 
             9.2 
    Non-Assignability of Benefits. 
     No Participant, Beneficiary or distributees of benefits under the Plan shall have any power or right to transfer, assign, anticipate, hypothecate or otherwise encumber any part or all of the amounts payable hereunder, which are expressly declared to be unassignable and nontransferable. Any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void. No amount payable hereunder shall, prior to actual payment thereof, be subject to seizure by any creditor of any such Participant, Beneficiary or other distributees for the payment of any debt judgment or other obligation, by a proceeding at law or in equity, nor transferable by operation of law in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency or death of such Participant, Beneficiary or other distributee hereunder. 
             9.3 
    Withholding and Deduction and Taxes.  
     All deferrals and payments provided for hereunder shall be subject to applicable withholding and other deductions as shall be required of the Company under any applicable local, state or federal law. The Company may require that the Participant or Beneficiary making a deferral or receiving payments pay to the Company the amount of any federal, state or local taxes, if any, that the Company or any Affiliate is required to withhold with respect to such deferrals or payments or the Company or any Affiliate may deduct from other wages paid by the Company or any Affiliate the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such deferrals or payments.  A Participant or Beneficiary shall be solely responsible for any tax consequences related to deferrals or payments made under the Plan.  The Company shall have no obligation to make any payment under the Plan until the Company s or any Affiliate s tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant or Beneficiary.  
             9.4 
    Amendment and Termination. 
     The Committee or its delegate may from time to time, in its discretion, amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan; provided, however, that no amendment may be made that would impair the rights of a Participant with respect to amounts already allocated to his or her Account without the Participant s consent. To the extent consistent with the rules relating to plan terminations and liquidations in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) or otherwise consistent with Section 409A of the Code, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may terminate the Plan and any related Deferred Compensation Election at any time and in that event the Committee may provide that, without the prior written consent of Participants, the Participants  Accounts shall be distributed in a single cash lump sum upon termination of the Plan. Unless so distributed in accordance with the preceding sentence, in the event of a Plan termination, the Plan Administrator shall continue to maintain the Participants  Accounts until distributed pursuant to the terms of the Plan and Participants shall remain one hundred percent (100%) vested in all amounts credited to their Accounts. In the event of a Plan termination, the distribution of a Participant s Grandfathered Deferral Account and Grandfathered Company Account shall be made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan as set forth on October 3,

    Compliance with Securities and Other Laws. 
     Notwithstanding any Plan provision to the contrary, the Committee may at any time impose such restrictions on the Plan and participation therein, including limiting the amount of any deferral or the timing thereof, as the Committee may deem advisable from time to time in order to comply or preserve compliance with any applicable laws, including any applicable state and federal securities laws and exemptions from registration available thereunder. 
     Nothing contained in the Plan and no action taken pursuant to its provisions by the Company or any person, shall create, nor be construed to create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant, Beneficiary, or any other person. 
             9.7 
    Unsecured General Creditor Status of Employee. 
     The payments to the Participant, Beneficiary or any other distributees hereunder shall be made from assets which shall continue, for all purposes, to be a part of the general, unrestricted assets of the Company. No person shall have or acquire any interest in any such assets by virtue of the provisions of the Plan. The Company s obligation hereunder shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future. To the extent that the Participant, Beneficiary or other distributees acquire a right to receive payments from the Company under the provisions hereof, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. No such person shall have or acquire any legal or equitable right, interest or claim in or to any property or assets of the Company. 
  In the event that, in its discretion, the Company purchases an insurance policy, or policies, insuring the life of the Employee, or any other property, to allow the Company to recover the cost of providing the benefits, in whole, or in part, hereunder, neither the Participant, Beneficiary or other distributee shall have or acquire any rights whatsoever therein or in the proceeds therefrom. The Company shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of any such policy or policies and, as such, shall possess and, may exercise all incidents of ownership therein. No such policy, policies or other property shall be held in any trust for a Participant, Beneficiary or other distributee or held as collateral security for any obligation of the Company hereunder. An Employee s participation in the underwriting or other steps necessary to acquire such policy or policies may be required by the Company and, if required, shall not be a suggestion of any beneficial interest in such policy or policies to a Participant. 
     A Participant and his or her Beneficiary shall assume all risk in connection with any decrease in value of his or her Account, and neither the     Company nor the Committee or the Plan Administrator shall be liable or responsible therefor. 
             9.9 
    Payment to Minors and Incompetents. 
     If any Participant, spouse, or Beneficiary entitled to receive any benefits hereunder is a minor or is deemed by the Plan Administrator or is adjudicated to be legally incapable of giving a valid receipt and discharge for such benefits, the benefits will be paid to the person or entity as the Plan Administrator determines has been appointed or established to receive such payment on behalf of such person. Such payment shall, to the extent made, be deemed a complete discharge of any payment obligation under the Plan.

9.10 
    Acceleration of or Delay in Payments. 
     The Plan Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, may elect to accelerate the time or form of payment of a benefit owed to the Participant hereunder, provided such acceleration is permitted under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4) and any subsequent guidance. The Plan Administrator may also, in its sole and absolute discretion, delay the time for payment of a benefit owed to the Participant hereunder, to the extent permitted under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A- 2(b)(7) and any subsequent guidance. 
     If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof; instead, each provision shall be fully severable and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein. 
     All provisions of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Rhode Island, except to the extent preempted by federal law. 
     The terms of the Plan shall be binding on each Participant and his or her heirs and legal representatives and on the Company and its successors and assigns.

  5.    Participation.

  (c) A participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided in Section 10 hereof, or may decrease the rate of his or her payroll deductions during the Offering Period, by completing and filing with the Administrator a new subscription agreement authorizing a change in payroll deduction rate.  Unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, a participant may not change or discontinue his or her payroll deduction rate more than once during any Offering Period.  The change in rate shall be effective with the first payroll period following the first of the month after the Administrator s receipt of the new subscription agreement provided the change in rate election is received by the last business day prior to the fifteenth (15   th   ) of the preceding month, unless the Company elects to process a given change in participation more quickly.

  (e) The Company or any Designated Subsidiary is authorized to withhold from any payment to be made to a participant, including any payroll and other payments not related to the Plan, amounts of withholding and other taxes due in connection with any transaction under the Plan, including any disposition of shares acquired under the Plan, and a participant s enrollment in the Plan will be deemed to constitute his or her consent to such withholding.  At the time of a participant s exercise of an option or disposition of shares acquired under the Plan, the Company may require the participant to make other arrangements to meet tax withholding obligations as a condition to exercise of rights or distribution of shares or cash from the participant s Account.  In addition, a Participant may be required to advise the Company of sales and other dispositions of Stock acquired under the Plan in order to permit the Company to comply with tax laws and to claim any tax deductions to which the Company may be entitled with respect to the Plan. 
  7.    Grant of Option  .    On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period shall be granted an option to purchase on the Exercise Date of such Offering Period, at the applicable Purchase Price, up to a number of shares of Stock determined by dividing such Employee s payroll deductions accumulated prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Participant s Account as of the Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price; provided that such purchase shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 12 hereof.  Exercise of the option shall occur as provided in Section 8 hereof, unless the participant has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10 hereof.  To the extent not exercised, the option shall expire on the last day of the Offering Period. 
  8.    Exercise of Option.    Participant s option for the purchase of shares shall be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of shares subject to option shall be purchased for such participant at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his or her account.  Shares purchased shall include fractional shares calculated to at least three decimal places, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  If fractional shares are not to be purchased for a participant s Account, any payroll deductions accumulated in a participant s account not sufficient to purchase a full share shall be retained in the participant s account for the subsequent Offering Period, subject to earlier withdrawal by the participant as provided in Section 10 hereof.  During a participant s lifetime, a participant s option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her. 
  9.    Delivery of Shares; Participant Accounts. 
  (a) At or as promptly as practicable after the Exercise Date for an Offering Period, the Company will deliver the shares of Stock purchased to the Custodian for deposit into the participant s Account.

  4 

be paid over by the Company to the Custodian at the dividend payment date.  The Custodian will aggregate all purchases of Stock in connection with the Plan for a given dividend payment date.  Purchases of Stock for purposes of dividend reinvestment will be made as promptly as practicable (but not more than 30 days) after a dividend payment date.  The Custodian will make such purchases, as directed by the Committee, either (i) in transactions on any securities exchange upon which Stock is traded, otherwise in the over-the-counter market, or in negotiated transactions, or (ii) directly from the Company at 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the dividend payment date.  Any shares of Stock distributed as a dividend or distribution in respect of shares of Stock or in connection with a split of the Stock credited to a participant s Account will be credited to such Account.  In the event of any other non-cash dividend or distribution in respect of Stock credited to a participant s Account, the Custodian will, if reasonably practicable and at the direction of the Committee, sell any property received in such dividend or distribution as promptly as practicable and use the proceeds to purchase additional shares of Common Stock in the same manner as cash paid over to the Custodian for purposes of dividend reinvestment. 
  (c) Each participant will be entitled to vote the number of shares of Stock credited to his or her Account (including any fractional shares credited to such Account) on any matter as to which the approval of the Company s stockholders is sought.  If a participant does not vote or grant a valid proxy with respect to shares credited to his or her Account, such shares will be voted by the Custodian in accordance with any stock exchange or other rules governing the Custodian in the voting of shares held for customer accounts.  Similar procedures will apply in the case of any consent solicitation of Company stockholders. 
  10.    Withdrawal of Payroll Deductions or Shares; Termination of Employment. 
  (a) If a participant decreases his or her payroll deduction rate to zero during an Offering Period, payroll deductions shall not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Offering Period unless the participant delivers to the Administrator a new subscription agreement. 
  (b) Upon a participant s ceasing to be an Employee for any reason (including upon the participant s death), he or she shall be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the payroll deductions credited to such participant s Account during the Offering Period but not yet used to exercise the option shall be returned to such participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 14 hereof, and such participant s option shall be automatically terminated. 
  (c) During the eighteen (18) month period from the first day of each Offering Period a participant (whether or not still an Employee) may not withdraw, sell or transfer shares of stock acquired during such Offering Period except: (i) on account of the participant s death, or such other reason as the Committee may promulgate in its discretion from time to time, or (ii) if a participant who is an Employee incurs a financial hardship which the Administrator determines, in accordance with rules established by the Committee, cannot be met from other sources.  The amount withdrawn, sold or transferred on account of a hardship shall not be in excess of the amounts necessary to meet such financial hardship of the participant, including amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or local taxes with respect to such amount.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant may make only one withdrawal, sale or transfer due to hardship in any Offering Period, and the minimum amount of such withdrawal, sale or transfer is $500.  After the end of such eighteen (18) month period, the participant may elect to withdraw, transfer or sell such shares or receive a  
      
  5 

certificate for such shares.  If a participant elects to withdraw shares in certificated form, one or more certificates for whole shares shall be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the participant, with such participant receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of withdrawal.  If shares of Stock are transferred from a participant s Account to a broker-dealer or financial institution that maintains an account for the participant, only whole shares shall be transferred and cash in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to such participant based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of transfer.  A Participant seeking to withdraw, sell or transfer shares of Stock must give instructions to the Custodian in such manner and form as may be prescribed by the Committee and the Custodian, which instructions will be acted upon as promptly as practicable.  Withdrawals and transfers will be subject to any fees imposed in accordance with Section 10(d) hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a condition for a hardship withdrawal, sale or transfer, the participant must furnish proof of a  financial hardship  satisfactory to the Administrator and demonstrate that said distribution is necessary to satisfy said financial need.  For purposes of this Section 10, a    financial hardship    means one or more of the events defined as a deemed immediate and heavy financial need under the IRS Regulation 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)(iii)(B), which causes an unforeseeable financial hardship to the participant or his or her family. 
  (d) Costs and expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan and maintenance of Accounts will be paid by the Company, including annual fees of the Custodian and any brokerage fees and commissions for the purchase of Stock upon reinvestment of dividends and distributions.  The foregoing notwithstanding, the Custodian may impose or pass through a reasonable fee for the withdrawal of Stock in the form of stock certificates (as permitted under Section 10(c)), and reasonable fees for other services unrelated to the purchase of Stock under the Plan, to the extent approved in writing by the Company and communicated to participants.  In no circumstance shall the Company pay any brokerage fees and commissions for the sale of Stock acquired under the Plan by a participant. 
  11.    Interest.    No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a participant in the Plan. 
  12.    Stock. 
  (a) The maximum number of shares of Stock which shall be made available for sale under the Plan shall be thirty (30) million shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18 hereof.  If, on a given Exercise Date, the number of shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares then available under the Plan, the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining available for purchase in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable.  Any shares of Stock delivered by the Company under the Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares or shares acquired by the Company in the open market.  Shares acquired in the open market through dividend reinvestment will not count against the Reserves. 
  (b) The participant shall have no interest or voting right in shares purchasable upon exercise of his or her option until such option has been exercised. 
  13.    Administration. 
  (a) The Plan shall be administered by the Committee except to the extent the Board elects to administer the Plan, in which case references herein to the  Committee  shall be deemed to include references to the  Board .  The Committee shall have full and final authority to  
      
  6 

construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to determine eligibility and to adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan.  The Committee may, in its discretion, delegate authority to the Administrator.  Every finding, decision and determination made by the Committee or Administrator shall, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties (except for any reserved right of the Committee to review a finding, decision or determination of the Administrator).  The Committee, Administrator, and each member thereof shall be entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to him or her by any executive officer, other officer or employee of the Company or any Designated Subsidiary, the Company s independent auditors, consultants or any other agents assisting in the administration of the Plan.  Members of the Committee or Administrator and any officer or employee of the Company or any Designated Subsidiary acting at the direction or on behalf of the Committee shall not be personally liable for any action or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company with respect to any such action or determination. 
  (b) The Custodian will act as custodian under the Plan, and will perform such duties as are set forth in the Plan and in any agreement between the Company and the Custodian.  The Custodian will establish and maintain, as agent for each Participant, an Account and any subaccounts as may be necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. 
  14.    Designation of Beneficiary. 
  (a) A participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the participant s Account under the Plan in the event of (i) such participant s death subsequent to an Exercise Date on which the option is exercised but prior to a distribution to such participant of shares or cash then held in the participant s Account or (ii) such participant s death prior to exercise of the option.  If a participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent shall be required for such designation to be effective. 
  (b) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the participant at any time by written notice.  In the event of the death of a participant without a valid designated beneficiary who is living at the time of such participant s death, any shares or cash otherwise deliverable under Section 14(a) shall be deliverable to the participant s surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, to such participant s estate. 
  15.    Transferability.    Neither payroll deductions credited to a participant s account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 14 hereof) by the participant.  Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect. 
  16.    Use of Funds.    All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions. 
  17.    Reports.    An individual Account shall be maintained by the Custodian for each participant in the Plan.  Statements of Account shall be given to each participant at least annually, which statements shall set forth the amounts of payroll deductions, the Purchase Price, the number of  
      
  7 

shares purchased, any remaining cash balance, and other information deemed relevant by the Committee. 
  18.    Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Liquidation, Merger or Asset Sale. 
  (a)   Changes in Capitalization  .  The Committee shall proportionately adjust the Reserves and the price per share and the number of shares of Stock covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Stock, or other extraordinary corporate event which affects the Stock in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of participants.  The determination of the Committee with respect to any such adjustment shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
  (b)   Dissolution or Liquidation  .  In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Offering Period shall terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Committee. 
  (c)   Asset Sale or Merger  .  In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, the Committee shall shorten the Offering Period then in progress by setting a new Exercise Date (the    New Exercise Date   ).  The New Exercise Date shall be before the date of the Company s proposed asset sale or merger.  The Committee shall notify each participant in writing, at least ten business days prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the participant s option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the participant s option shall be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10 hereof. 
  19.    Amendment or Termination. 
  (a) The Board (and the Committee or the Administrator except with respect to the number of shares of Stock available under the Plan under Section 12) may at any time and for any reason terminate or amend the Plan.  Except as provided in Section 18 hereof, no such termination can affect options previously granted, provided that an Offering Period may be terminated by the Board of Directors by shortening the Offering Period and accelerating the Exercise Date to a date not prior to the date of such Board action if the Board determines that termination of the Plan is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.  Except as provided in Section 18 and this Section 19, no amendment may make any change in any option theretofore granted which materially adversely affects the rights of any participant, and any amendment will be subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders not later than one year after Board approval of such amendment if such stockholder approval is required by any federal or state law or regulation or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock may then be listed or quoted, or if such stockholder approval is necessary in order for the Plan to continue to meet the requirements of Section 423 of the Code, and the Board may otherwise, in its discretion, determine to submit any amendment to stockholders for approval. 
  (b) Without stockholder consent and without regard to whether any participant rights may be considered to have been  adversely affected,  the Committee shall be entitled to change the Offering Periods, limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount withheld during an Offering Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a  
      
  8 

currency other than U.S. dollars, permit payroll withholding in excess of the amount designated by a participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company s processing of properly completed withholding elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Stock for each participant properly correspond with amounts withheld from the participant s Compensation, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Committee determines in its sole discretion are advisable and consistent with the Plan. 
  20.    Notices.    All notices or other communications by a participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof. 
  21.    Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares  .    The Company shall not be obligated to issue shares with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. 
  22.    Plan Effective Date and Stockholder Approval  .    The Plan was adopted by the Board on March 7, 2007, and became effective upon approval by the Company s stockholders on May 9, 2007 by a vote sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 423(b)(2) of the Code.  The Plan as amended was adopted by the Board on March 6, 2013, and became effective upon approval by the Company s stockholders on May 9, 2013 by a vote sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 423(b)(2) of the Code.

Exhibit 10.21 

2015 Management Incentive Plan 
    
  I.      Objectives and Summary 
  CVS Health Corporation s Management Incentive Plan (the  MIP ) is designed to reward incentive-eligible employees ( Eligible Participants ) of CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries (together,  the Company ) for their role in driving performance and to encourage Eligible Participants  continued employment with the Company.  Funding for the payment of incentive awards will be based on actual results measured against pre-established financial goals.  The amount of each incentive award paid will be based on the performance of the Company and the performance of the individual Eligible Participant. 
    
  The MIP shall be administered by the Management Planning and Development Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) under the provisions herein and of the 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  ICP ), and the Committee may delegate to officers of CVS Health the authority to perform administrative functions of the MIP as the Committee may determine and may appoint officers and others to assist it in administering the MIP. 
  II.      Plan Year 
  The MIP is a calendar year plan, which runs from January 1 to December 31, 2015 ( Plan Year ).  All dates in this document occur during the Plan Year unless otherwise stated. 
    
  III.      Eligibility 
  A.    Eligibility for Participation 
  The Chief Executive Officer of CVS Health Corporation ( CEO ) will determine those employees who are eligible for participation in the MIP, provided that the Committee shall determine the eligibility of employees who are or may be subject to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (collectively,  Section 162(m) Eligible Participants , whom will also be included in the term  Eligible Participants  unless otherwise noted).  In general, Eligible Participants include all exempt employees who are not covered by any other incentive plans (including the Executive Incentive Plan) and who are employed on or before November 1 of the Plan Year; provided, however, that an employee who becomes a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant after January 1 of the Plan Year shall be eligible for an award under the MIP only to the extent that such award does not violate the requirements of Section 162(m). 
    
  The CEO (or, as to Section 162(m) Eligible Participants, the Committee) may, for any reason and in his or her (or its) sole discretion, at any time prior to the end of the Plan Year, determine an employee s eligibility for participation in the MIP.  Eligible Participants are subject to the terms and conditions relating to incentive awards set forth in the MIP. 
    
  B.    Section 162(m) Eligible Participants 
  Section 162(m) Eligible Participants shall be subject to the limitations required to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m).  Subject to the requirements of Section 162(m), the Committee shall retain sole discretion to determine a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant s eligibility for an award, the target award, and the amount of the actual award.  In no event shall a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant s award exceed the amount permitted by Section 162(m). 
    
  C.    Newly-Eligible Employees    
  The award, if any, to an Eligible Participant who became an Eligible Participant after the beginning of the Plan Year may be prorated based on the date of eligibility. 

D.    Position Change    
  An employee who becomes an Eligible Participant on or before November 1 of the Plan Year as a result of a position change may be eligible for a prorated MIP award.  If a position change results in an an employee becoming an Eligible Participant for part of the Plan Year and other incentives during other parts of the Plan Year, the employee may be  
    2015 Management Incentive Plan    1            Confidential   Proprietary 

eligible to receive a prorated award for the amount of time in each incentive eligible position, subject to the terms of each applicable incentive plan.  A position change from one MIP-eligible position to another MIP-eligible postion during the Plan Year does not result in a prorata award but rather an award funded on the base salary of the Eligible Participant on December 31 of the Plan Year and the individual award opportunity as of that date. 
    
    E.    Demotions 
  If a previously Eligible Participant is demoted to a non-incentive eligible position due to his or her violation of CVS Health policy or his or her performance, or if he or she voluntarily transfers to a non-incentive eligible position during the Plan Year, and is in the non-incentive eligible position on the last day of the Plan Year, he or she will not be eligible to earn an incentive award for the Plan Year under the MIP. 
    
  F.    Terminations 
  Unless otherwise stated in Section VII of the MIP, if an Eligible Participant s employment terminates prior to the final determination of incentive awards for the Plan Year, he or she will not be eligible to receive an incentive award under the MIP.  The final determination of incentive awards generally occurs in February of the year following the Plan Year. 
    
  G.    Rehires 
  Employees who are rehired as Eligible Participants on or before November 1 of the Plan Year may be eligible for a prorated incentive award.  For purposes of proration, credit will only be given for time worked during the Plan Year in incentive-eligible positions. 
    
  IV.       Target Measurements and Total Pool 
  A.    Consolidated Company Funding    
  MIP funding is based on consolidated Company performance, measured by Operating Profit, Pharmacy Benefit Management ( PBM ) Client Satisfaction, and Retail Customer Service as defined below.  Achievement of the Company s Operating Profit target will determine 80% of the total funding (the  Total Pool  achievement of PBM Client Satisfaction targets will determine 10% of the Total Pool; and achievement of the Retail Customer Service target, as measured by  myCustomer Experience  scores, will determine the remaining 10% of the Total Pool. 
    
  1.      Operating Profit 
  Operating Profit is determined by reference to EBIT (see Exhibit A) and may be adjusted by the financial adjustments as approved by the Committee prior to the end of the first fiscal quarter of the Plan Year (the  Financial Adjustments ). 
    
  If Operating Profit is below the minimum threshhold of 96.9% (see Exhibit B), no formulaic funding will be made available for incentive awards, regardless of Retail Customer Service and PBM Client Satisfaction performance, and there shall be no  incentive awards paid under the MIP. 
  2.      PBM Client Satisfaction 
  Achievement of the PBM Client Satisfaction component of incentive funding will be determined by the aggregate actual performance against target (see Exhibit B) of the weighted composite of the following surveys: 
             
    Client Relationship and Loyalty Survey (weight = 50%) 
                
    Mail Service Pharmacy and Customer Care Survey (weight = 25%) 
                
    Specialty Pharmacy Satisfaction Survey (weight = 25%) 
     PBM Client Satisfaction funding is subject to adjustment based on Operating Profit. 
  3.    Retail Customer Service 
  The Retail Customer Service component of the incentive funding will be determined using the myCustomer Experience actual performance against the target (see Exhibit B).  The myCustomer Experience score is derived based on Rx Score and Front Store score and assigned weightings. 
    
  Retail Customer Service funding is subject to adjustment based on Operating Profit.

  B.    Total Pool Funding 
  After the achievement of at least threshold for Operating Profit has been confirmed, performance of PBM Client Satisfaction and Retail Customer Service compared to target for the Plan Year will be calculated.  The Total Pool for all business units will be fully based (100%) on consolidated Company performance. 
    
  The CEO or, in the case of Section 162(m) Eligible Participants, the Committee may adjust  the funding of the Total Pool at his or her or its discretion based on (a) input from the PBM and Retail Presidents and Finance regarding their assessment of the overall performance of the Company; and (b) assessment of the achievement of Plan Year performance goals.  In no case, however, can the CEO or the Committee increase Total Pool funding due to PBM Client Satisfaction or Retail Customer Service results. 
  C.    Individual Performance 
  The Total Pool will be available for award to Eligible Participants under the MIP, taking into account the individual contribution of each Eligible Participant.  The amount, if any, of the incentive award for an Eligible Participant shall be detemined in the sole discretion of the Company, which shall be final, binding and conclusive as to all parties having an interest therein.  The amount, if any, of the  incentive award for a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, which shall be final, binding and conclusive as to all parties having an interest therein. 
    
  V.      Earnings and Payout 
  A.    Timing 
  Incentive awards will be paid to Eligible Participants as soon as administratively feasible following the date the Total Pool is determined and approved and the amount of incentive payments is determined for each eligible participant, but in any case on or before March 15 of the year immediately following the Plan Year.  Incentive payments under the MIP may be subject to garnishments and other state or federal requirements. 
    
  B.    Calculations 
  Calculations for full and partial awards will be based on each Eligible Participant s annual base salary and individual target opportunity as of the last day of the Plan Year. 
    
  For purposes of proration, the 15   th    of the month will be used to determine if the month is included or excluded from the incentive calculation, as follows: 
           1. 
    If an Eligible Participant is hired or returns to work from an authorized leave of absence on or before the 15   th    of the month, the full month will be included in the incentive calculations. 
              2. 
    If an Eligible Participant is hired or returns to work from an authorized leave of absence after the 15   th    of the month, then the full month will be excluded from the incentive calculations. 
       2015 Management Incentive Plan    3            Confidential   Proprietary 

3. 
    If an Eligible Participant s employment is terminated on or before the 15   th    of the month and the employee is eligible for a prorated award under the Plan, then the full month will be excluded from incentive calculations. 
              4. 
    If an Eligible Participant s employment is terminated after the 15   th    of the month and the employee is eligible for a prorated award under the Plan, then the full month will be included in the incentive calculations. 
     Examples:  
           a.  
    An employee is hired as an Eligible Participant on September 14   th   .  Because the Eligible Participant is actively employed prior to the 15   th    of September, the full month of September will be included in his/her prorated incentive award and the Eligible Participant will receive a prorated incentive award covering a total of four months.  The award will be calculated using the Eligible Participant s individual award opportunity target and base salary as of December 31   st   . 
              b.  
    An Eligible Participant begins a personal leave of absence on June 3   rd    and returns to active status on July 22   nd   .  Assuming the Eligible Participant was incentive eligible for the entire year, the months of June and July will be excluded from the Eligible Participant s incentive award and the Eligible Participant will receive a prorated incentive award covering a total of 10 months.  The award will be calculated using the Eligible Participant s individual award opportunity target and base salary as of December 31   st   . 
     C.    Award Opportunity 
  Individual target awards will be determined by position and may vary based on the Eligible Participant s level in the organization. 
    
  D.    Obligation to Pay Out Percentage of Total Pool 
  Eligible Participants, as a group, have a right to receive an amount at least equal to the Total Pool, but no individual Eligible Participant shall be entitled to receive an award or any specific amount of the Total Pool.  In no event will the aggregate of the total awards paid from the MIP be less than 92.5% of the Total Pool.  To discourage unmerited litigation, any party or class asserting a challenge or claim against the Company under any provision of the MIP, including this Section V, shall bear their own costs relating to such challenge or claim, and if the challenge or claim is unsuccessful, such party or class shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable costs incurred by the Company in responding to such challenge or claim. 
    
  VI.      Corrections to Incentive Awards 
  Any requested corrections to incentive award calculations must be submitted through the Human Resources Business Partner to Compensation by April 15 of the year following the Plan Year. 
    
  VII.          Eligible Participant Status 
  A.    Performance 
  Subject to the requirements of Section 162(m), the Company has full discretion in determining the amount, if any, of a MIP award to an Eligible Participant, including Eligible Participants whose awards may be based on SGIs, and the Participant s individual performance throughout the Plan Year will be considered by the Company in the final determination of the Eligible Participant s incentive award. 
    
  B.    Leaves of Absence 
  An Eligible Participant on a Company-approved leave of absence at any time during the Plan Year who remains employed in an eligible position as of the last day of the Plan Year will earn a prorated incentive award based on the number of months actively worked (including time compensated as vacation, myTime or Paid Time Off ( PTO )) during the Plan Year, provided he or she meets all other eligibility criteria for an incentive award.  For purposes of proration, the 15   th    of the month will be used to determine if the month is included or excluded from the incentive calculation, as set forth above in Section V.B. 

2015 Management Incentive Plan    4            Confidential   Proprietary 

C.    Reduction in Force, Retirement and Death 
  1.    Reduction in Force 
  If an Eligible Participant is separated from employment by the Company on or before the last day of the Plan Year due to a reduction in force, he or she may be eligible, at the Company s discretion, to receive a prorated incentive award based on the number of months worked during the Plan Year and incentive targets in place immediately before the separation date, provided the Eligible Participant meets all other eligibility criteria for an incentive award.  For purposes of proration, the 15   th    of the month will be used to determine if the month is included or excluded from the incentive calculation, as set forth above. 
  2.    Retirement    
  If an Eligible Participant is at least age 55 and has a minimum of 10 years of service with CVS Health or a predecessor company/subsidiary   or   is at least age 60 and has a minimum of 5 years of service with CVS Health or a predecessor company/subsidiary   and   the Eligible Participant retires before the end of the Plan Year, he/she may be eligible to receive a prorated incentive award based on the number of months worked during the Plan Year and incentive targets in place immediately before the termination date, provided he/she meets all other eligibility criteria for an incentive award.  Eligible Participants who do not meet the minimum retirement requirements under this section at the time of retirement and who retire before the end of the Plan Year will   not   be eligible for an incentive award. 
  3.    Death 
  In case of the death of an Eligible Participant, a prorated incentive award may be paid to the Eligible Participant s spouse, if living; otherwise, in equal shares to surviving children of the Eligible Participant.  If there are no surviving children, the benefit shall be paid to the Eligible Participant s estate.  The incentive award will be prorated based on the number of months the Eligible Participant worked during the Plan Year     and   incentive targets   in place   immediately before the   termination   date, and shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable following the death of the Eligible Participant but no later than March 15 of the year following the Plan Year. 
  VIII.    Miscellaneous 
    A.    No Promise of Continued Employment 
  The MIP does not create an express or implied contract of employment between CVS Heath and an Eligible Participant.  Both CVS Health and the Eligible Participant retain the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, at any time and for any reason. 
  B.    Rights are Non-Assignable 
  Neither the Eligible Participant, nor any beneficiary, nor any other person shall have any right to assign, in whole or in part, the right to receive payments under the MIP.  Payments are non-assignable and non-transferable, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. 
    
  C.    Compliance with Applicable Law 
    An Eligible Participant must comply with all applicable state and federal law and CVS Health policies to be eligible to receive an incentive award under the MIP. 
    
  CVS Health will comply with all applicable laws concerning incentive awards; the MIP and its administration are not intended to conflict with any applicable state or federal law. 
  D.    Change in Control 
  In the event of a change in control of CVS Health, as defined in the ICP, the MIP shall remain in full force and effect.  Any amendments, modifications, termination or dissolution of the MIP by the acquiring entity may only occur prospectively and will not affect incentive targets or awards or eligibility in place immediately before the date of the change in control or such later date as it may be modified or dissolved by the acquiring entity. 
    
  Provisions regarding the payment of annual incentive awards that are set forth in change in control agreements with Eligible Employees shall supersede those appearing in the MIP. 
    2015 Management Incentive Plan    5            Confidential   Proprietary 

E.    Withholding 
  All required deductions will be withheld from the incentive awards prior to distribution.  This includes all applicable federal, state, or local taxes, as well as any eligible 401(k) deductions and deferred compensation contributions as defined by the applicable plans.  Incentive awards that are deferred will be taxed according to applicable federal and state tax law.  Each Eligible Participant shall be solely responsible for any tax consequences of his or her award hereunder. 
    
  F.    MIP Amendment/Modification/Termination 
  CVS Health retains the right to amend, modify, or terminate the MIP at any time on or before the last day of the Plan Year for any reason, with or without notice to Eligible Participants, provided that no changes shall be made with respect to a Section 162(m) Eligible Participant that would not comply with the requirements of Section 162(m). 
    
  G.    MIP Interpretation 
  All inquiries with respect to the MIP and any requests for interpretation of any provision in the MIP must be submitted to the appropriate Human Resources Business Partner in writing.  Failure to submit a request for resolution of a dispute or question in writing within 30 days of distribution of the incentive award may result in a waiver of the Eligible Participant s rights to dispute the MIP provision or amount of the incentive award. 
    
  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such defined term(s) in the ICP.  In the event of any conflict between the ICP and the MIP, the terms of the ICP shall govern. 
  H.    Recoupment of Incentive Awards 
  Each incentive award under the MIP shall be subject to the terms of the Company s Recoupment Policy as it exists from time to time, which may require the Eligible Employee to immediately repay to the Company the value of any pre-tax economic benefit that he or she may derive from the MIP. 
    
  I.    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code 
  The Company intends that the MIP not violate any applicable provision of, or result in any additional tax or penalty under, Section 409A of the Code, as amended, and the regulations and guidance thereunder (collectively,  Section 409A ), and that to the extent any provisions of the Plan do not comply with Section 409A the Company will make such changes as it deems reasonable in order to comply with Section 409A.  Payments hereunder are intended to qualify as short-term deferral payments under Section 409A.  In all events, the provisions of CVS Health Corporation s Universal 409A Definition Document are hereby incorporated by reference, and notwithstanding the any other provision of the Plan or any Award to the contrary, to the extent required to avoid a violation of the applicable rules under Section 409A by reason of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (requiring certain delays for  specified employees ), payment of any amounts subject to Section 409A shall be delayed until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date of termination of employment.  For purposes of any provision of the Plan providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits in connection with a termination of employment, references to an Eligible Person s  termination of employment  (and corollary terms) shall be construed to refer to the Eligible Person s  separation from service  with the Company as determined under Section 409A.

             2015 Executive Incentive Plan 

I.      Objectives and Summary 
  CVS Health Corporation s Executive Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) governs annual incentive awards for certain key executive officers of CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries (together,  the Company ).  The purpose of the Plan is to reward certain key executive officers of the Company for their material contributions to the Company and to motivate them to continue making such contributions in the future.  The Plan is intended to provide performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), and the provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted to effectuate such intent. 
    
  The Management Planning and Development Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) shall administer the Plan under the provisions herein and of the 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  ICP ) and shall have authority, without limitation, to determine the Participants (as defined in Section III), to determine the terms and conditions of any Award (as defined in Section III) and to interpret the Plan.  Subject to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, delegate to officers of CVS Health the authority to perform administrative functions of the Plan as the Committee may determine and may appoint officers and others to assist it in administering the Plan. 
  II.      Plan Year 
  The Plan is a calendar year plan, which runs from January 1 to December 31 ( Plan Year ). 
    
  III.      Eligible Participants 
  Within 90 days after the start of the applicable Plan Year, the Committee shall designate the key executives of the Company who are eligible to participate in the Plan for the Plan Year (each, a  Participant ) and to receive an award under the terms of the Plan (an  Award ).  The Participants for the Plan Year shall be set forth in the Exhibit A to the Plan related to the Plan Year ( Exhibit A ).  Except as the Committee may otherwise determine, it is intended that the Participants for any Plan Year shall include all employees who are treated as  covered employees  within the meaning of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code for that Plan Year and whose compensation for such Plan Year consequently may be subject to the limit on deductible compensation imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code.  The Committee may designate a key executive as a Participant after the first 90 days of the applicable Plan Year, but only if the key executive is a new employee of the Company. 
    
  IV.      Bonus Pool 
  A.  For each Plan Year, the Company will establish a pool of funds for that Plan Year in an amount equal to 0.5% of the Company s Adjusted Net Income for the Plan year (the  Bonus Pool ).  For purposes of the Plan,  Adjusted Net Income  is defined as adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health as reported by the Company in its year-end earnings.  Within 90 days of the start of the Plan Year, the Committee may make provision for excluding from the calculation of the Bonus Pool the effect of extraordinary events and changes in accounting methods, practices or policies. 
    
  B.  Within 90 days of the start of each Plan Year, the Committee will designate a percentage of the Bonus Pool to be allocated to each Participant and a percentage to be reserved in the event the Committee wishes to allocate a percentage to a new Participant, if any, after the first 90 days of the applicable Plan Year.  The allocations will be set forth in the Exhibit A for the Plan Year.  The maximum allocation that may  
    Executive Incentive Plan                    Confidential   Proprietary 

be made to any Participant for a Plan Year will be 40%, and in no event shall the allocations, in the aggregate, exceed 100% of the Bonus Pool.  Regardless of the foregoing, in no event shall any Participant be entitled to receive more than his or her individual cap as set forth in Exhibit A for the Plan Year. 
    
  V.        Awards    
  A.      Following the completion of each Plan Year, the Committee shall certify in writing the amount of the Bonus Pool and the actual Award amount, if any, payable to each Participant for such Plan Year.  Subject to Section V.B, the actual Award amount payable to a Participant shall equal his or her allocable percentage of the Bonus Pool as certified by the Committee. 
    
  B.      The Committee in its sole and exclusive discretion may reduce (including a reduction to zero) the Award to a Participant otherwise payable under the Plan for the Plan Year at any time prior to the payment of the Award to the Participant.  The exercise of such negative discretion with respect to one Participant shall not result in an increase in the amount payable to any other Participant. 
    
           VI. 
    Payment of Awards 
     A.  Subject to Section V, a Participant shall receive payment of an Award if he or she remains employed by the Company through the final determination of incentive awards for the Plan Year; provided, however, that no Participant shall be entitled to payment of an Award hereunder until the Committee makes the certification provided for in Section V.  The final determination of incentive awards generally occurs in February of the year following the Plan Year. 
    
  B.  Awards shall be paid in cash or in any other form prescribed by the Committee and shall be paid to Participants as soon as administratively feasible following the date that annual bonuses are determined and approved for Company employees generally, but in any case on or before March 15 of the year immediately following the Plan Year.  Awards may be subject to garnishments and other state or federal tax withholding requirements. 
  C.  Calculations for full and partial awards will be based on each Participant s annual base salary and individual target opportunity as of December 31st of the Plan Year.  For purposes of proration, the 15   th    of the month will be used to determine if the month is included or excluded from the incentive calculation, as follows: 
           1. 
    If a Participant s employment is terminated on or before the 15   th    of the month and the employee is eligible for a prorated award under the Plan, then the full month will be excluded from incentive calculations. 
              2. 
    If a Participant s employment is terminated after the 15   th    of the month and the employee is eligible for a prorated award under the Plan, then the full month will be included in the incentive calculations. 
       
  VII.          Retirement and Death 
  A.  If a Participant is at least age 55 and has a minimum of 10 years of service with the Company   or   is at least age 60 and has a minimum of 5 years of service with the Company   and   the Participant retires before the end of the Plan Year, he/she may be eligible to receive a prorated Award based on the number of months worked during the Plan Year, provided he/she meets all other eligibility criteria for an Award.  Participants who do not meet the minimum retirement requirements under this section at the time of retirement and who retire before the end of the Plan Year will   not   be eligible for an Award. 
    
  B.  In the case of the death of a Participant before the end of the Plan Year, a prorated Award may be paid to the Participant s spouse, if living; otherwise, a prorated Award may be paid in equal shares to surviving children of the Participant.  If there are no surviving children, a prorated Award may be paid to  
    Executive Incentive Plan    2            Confidential   Proprietary 

the Participant s estate.  If an Award is paid, the Award will be prorated based on the number of months the Participant worked during the Plan Year. 
    
  VIII.     Miscellaneous 
    A.      No Promise of Continued Employment 
  The Plan does not create an express or implied contract of employment between the Company and a Participant.  Both the Company and the Participant retain the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, at any time and for any reason. 
  B.      Rights are Non-Assignable 
  Neither the Participant, nor any beneficiary, nor any other person shall have any right to assign, in whole or in part, the right to receive payments under the Plan.  Payments are non-assignable and non-transferable, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. 
    
           C. 
    Compliance with Applicable Law 
       A Participant must comply with all applicable state and federal law and the policies of the Company to be eligible to receive an Award under the Plan. 
    
  The Company will comply with all applicable laws concerning incentive awards; the Plan and its administration are not intended to conflict with any applicable state or federal law. 
  D.      Change in Control 
  In the event of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the ICP, the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.  Any amendments, modifications, termination or dissolution of the Plan by the acquiring entity may only occur prospectively and will not affect incentive earnings or eligibility before the date of the change in control or such date as it may be modified or dissolved by the acquiring entity. 
    
  Provisions regarding the payment of annual incentive awards that are set forth in change in control agreements with Participants shall supersede those appearing in the Plan. 
  E.      Withholding 
  All required deductions will be withheld from the Awards prior to distribution.  This includes all applicable federal, state, or local taxes, as well as any eligible 401(k) deductions and deferred compensation contributions as defined by the applicable plans.  Awards that are deferred will be taxed according to applicable federal and state tax law.  Each Participant shall be solely responsible for any tax consequences of his or her Award hereunder. 
    
  F.      Amendment/Modification/Termination 
  The Company retains the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time on or before the last day of the Plan Year for any reason, with or without notice to Participants, provided that no changes shall be made that would not comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. 
    
           G. 
    Interpretation 
     All inquiries with respect to the Plan and any requests for interpretation of any provision in the Plan must be submitted to the Committee in writing.  Failure to submit a request for resolution of a dispute or question in writing within 30 days of distribution of the Award shall result in a waiver of the Participant s rights to dispute the Plan provision or amount of the Award. 
    
  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such defined term(s) in the ICP.  In the event of any conflict between the ICP and the Plan, the terms of the ICP shall govern.

H.      Recoupment of Incentive Awards    
  Each Award under the Plan shall be subject to the terms of the Company s Recoupment Policy as it exists from time to time, which may require a Participant to immediately repay to the Company the value of any pre-tax economic benefit that he or she may derive from the Plan. 
    
  I.      Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code 
  The Company intends that the MIP not violate any applicable provision of, or result in any additional tax or penalty under, Section 409A of the Code, as amended, and the regulations and guidance thereunder (collectively,  Section 409A ), and that to the extent any provisions of the Plan do not comply with Section 409A the Company will make such changes as it deems reasonable in order to comply with Section 409A.  Payments hereunder are intended to qualify as short-term deferral payments under Section 409A.  In all events, the provisions of CVS Health Corporation s Universal 409A Definition Document are hereby incorporated by reference.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award to the contrary, to the extent required to avoid a violation of Section 409A, payment of any amounts to  specified employees  shall be delayed until the first business day of the seventh (7   th   ) month following the date of termination of employment.  References to an Eligible Person s  termination of employment  (and corollary terms) shall be construed to refer to the Eligible Person s  separation from service  with the Company as determined under Section 409A.

For purposes of the Plan, distribution warehouse employees, field managers and employees employed by CVS ProCare, Inc. working at Company headquarters, shall be treated as working in a non-store location and therefore not subject to exclusion from eligibility.  For purposes of the Plan, individuals in the following categories will not be considered Eligible Employees: 
    
  (a)    individuals who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, provided welfare benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining, unless the terms of the collective bargaining agreement provide for participation in the Plan;  
    
  (b)    individuals who are seasonal employees, leased employees, independent contractors, temporary employees, or consultants; 
    
  (c)    individuals who work for the Employer or an Affiliate in a store location of the Company or an Affiliate, or whose compensation is paid through or according to a store payroll, including but not limited to: pharmacists, store managers, assistant store managers, crew, and pharmacy staff;

  The decision of whether an individual falls into one of these categories and whether an individual is employed by an Employer on a regular basis in a non-store position for a minimum of 12 months shall be made by the Employer in its sole discretion.  Any individual who is excluded from being considered an Eligible Employee under the Plan shall be excluded from the Plan regardless of the individual s reclassification by a government agency, including a reclassification by the Internal Revenue Service for tax withholding purposes.

For purposes of Subsection (h) of this Section 1.8, whether a job is considered  comparable  shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Employer, taking into account whether the new job is located 50 or fewer miles from the Eligible Employee s job at the time of the offer, whether the compensation offered is materially less than the Eligible Employee s compensation at the time of the offer, and whether the new job will result in a substantial change of duties from the Eligible Employee s job at the time of the offer.

  1.15       Weekly Rate    shall mean, (a) with respect to an Eligible Employee paid on a salaried basis, an Eligible Employee s annual base salary (as determined by the Employer), as of the date of the Eligible Employee s Involuntary Termination, expressed on a weekly basis (as determined in the sole discretion of the Employer), and (b) with respect to an Eligible Employee paid on an hourly basis, the hourly wage rate of the Eligible Employee as of the date of the Eligible Employee s Involuntary Termination multiplied by the Eligible Employee s regularly scheduled number of hours of service per week (as determined by the  
    4 

Employer), not in excess of 40 hours.  Weekly Rate shall exclude any overtime, incentive, and bonus payments, unless otherwise required by law.

  2.1    (a)      Eligibility  .  Upon his or her Involuntary Termination, an Eligible Employee may, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted Severance Pay and benefits provided under Subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this Section 2.1, provided the conditions of Section 2.2 are satisfied.

  (1)    For Rx America Legacy Employees who are Non-exempt Employees, the greater of (A) the RxAmerica Legacy Employee s Weekly Rate multiplied by the number of Years of Service, or (B) the RxAmerica Legacy Employee s Weekly Rate multiplied by eight (8);  
    
  (2)    For RxAmerica Legacy Employees who are Exempt Employees, the greater of (A) the RxAmerica Legacy Employee s Weekly Rate multiplied by the number of Years of Service, or (B) the RxAmerica Legacy Employee s Weekly Rate multiplied by twelve (12); 
           
  (3)    For RxAmerica Legacy Employees who are classified by the Employer (in its sole discretion) as a Manager or in an equivalent position, the greater of (A) the RxAmerica Legacy Employee s Weekly Rate multiplied by the number of Years of Service, or (B) the RxAmerica Legacy Employee s Weekly Rate multiplied by twenty-six (26);

Notwithstanding the above guidelines, the Plan Administrator may increase or decrease (including, to zero) the amount of Severance Pay with respect to any Eligible Employee for reasons it deems appropriate in its sole discretion (including, but not limited to, an increase to provide consideration for Eligible Employees who have outstanding employment agreements with an Employer or a decrease to take into account any debts owed to an Employer), and the Plan Administrator may make any such increase or decrease at any time, whether before or after payments of Severance Pay have commenced. 
    
  (c)      COBRA Assistance  .  In the event an Eligible Employee who has an Involuntary Termination (i) is eligible to elect continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 as amended ( COBRA ) in accordance with the terms of the medical and prescription drug plan and/or dental plan of the Employer and (ii) properly and timely elects such continuation coverage, the Employer may pay for a portion of the cost of COBRA coverage equivalent to the contribution which the Employer makes on behalf of similarly situated active employees under such plan for the appropriate tier of coverage selected and in place immediately prior to the date of the Eligible Employee s Involuntary Termination (  e.g.  , employee-only, family coverage), for a period determined in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator, which generally shall be the Severance Period.  Any COBRA assistance provided under this Subsection (c) shall be paid by the Employer directly to the insurance carrier, if applicable.  The portion of the COBRA premium not covered by the COBRA assistance specified in this Subsection (c) must be paid by the Eligible Employee directly to the insurance carrier or service provider that administers COBRA, as applicable, based on the standard rules under the respective plan for payment of COBRA premiums.  This Subsection (c) does not provide COBRA assistance in the event the Eligible Employee fails to properly and timely elect COBRA continuation coverage, regardless of whether his or her covered dependents elect COBRA continuation coverage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for an Eligible Employee who is an RxAmerica Legacy Employee eligible to elect COBRA continuation coverage in accordance with the terms of the medical and prescription drug plan and/or dental plan, the Employer may, in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator, pay for COBRA assistance, generally in the form of a single lump sum payment equal to the weekly COBRA premium (102 percent of the applicable premium, as defined in Code Section 4980B(f)(4)) for the Severance Period, based on the tier of coverage in which the RxAmerica Legacy Employee is enrolled as of the date of his or her Involuntary Termination. 
    
  (d)      Outplacement Services  .  Upon an Involuntary Termination, the outplacement services provided to an Eligible Employee shall be provided in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator based on the guidelines contained in this Subsection (d). 
    
  (i)     If an Eligible Employee so desires, he or she may be eligible for outplacement services for assistance in obtaining new employment, provided through a vendor selected by the Employer, with the Employer directly providing payment to such vendor.  The provision of outplacement services is contingent upon the Eligible Employee s cooperation with the outplacement service vendor, upon the active efforts of the Eligible Employee to locate a new position, and upon the Eligible Employee initiating outplacement services during the Severance Period. 
    
  (ii)    Subject to the requirements of Paragraph (i) of this Subsection (d), outplacement services shall be offered for a period of time determined in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator, based on guidelines that include: 
    
    7

Severance Pay that is paid in the form of salary continuation shall commence as soon as feasible following expiration of the later of the Consideration Period or the Revocation Period, which generally shall be the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the expiration of the Consideration Period or the Revocation Period, as the case may be, and shall thereafter be paid in substantially equal installments in accordance with the Employer s regular payroll practice, except as provided in Section 2.3 of the Plan; provided, with respect to RxAmerica Legacy Employees, Severance Pay shall be paid in a single lump sum.  Further, in the Plan Administrator s sole discretion, Severance Pay may be paid to any Eligible Employees in a single lump sum, in which event Severance Pay shall be paid within the period that satisfies the 409A requirements for short-term deferrals under Section 409A of the Code. 
    
  (f)      Withholding  .  Any payment of Severance Pay to an Eligible Employee shall be subject to normal withholding for state and federal income taxes and Social Security taxes.

    8 

(b)    the Eligible Employee must cooperate in transitioning all of the Eligible Employee s work in consultation with the Eligible Employee s supervisor or other designated employee;

In the event that any Severance Pay payable to an Eligible Employee would exceed the twenty-four (24) month period provided in the foregoing sentence if the Severance Pay continued to be paid in accordance with the Employer s regular payroll practice, any Severance Pay that would otherwise exceed the twenty-four (24) month time period will be paid to the Eligible Employee in a lump sum on the last regular payroll date within the twenty-four (24) month period.  For purposes of this Section 2.3,  Compensation  shall mean the Eligible Employee s total annualized compensation, based upon the annual rate of pay for services provided to the Employer for the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the Eligible Employee s Involuntary Termination occurs, adjusted for any increase in such preceding calendar year that was expected to continue indefinitely if the Eligible Employee had not had an Involuntary Termination. 
    
  2.4      Cessation of Severance Pay Upon Reemployment  .

  2.5      Cessation of Severance Pay After Commencement of Payments  .  If an Eligible Employee is deemed to have an Involuntary Termination and begins to receive Severance Pay under the Plan and the Employer or the Plan Administrator becomes aware of facts and circumstances that, had the Employer known same at the time of the Eligible Employee s termination of employment, would have affected the Employer s determination as to whether such Employee s termination was an Involuntary Termination, the Plan Administrator may suspend any future Severance Pay payments to the Eligible Employee while the Employer investigates the facts and circumstances and finalizes such investigation, and, if the Employer determines that the Eligible Employee should have been terminated for Cause, such Eligible Employee s Severance Pay shall cease as of the suspension date, any remaining Severance Pay shall be forfeited and any Severance Pay that has been paid shall be subject to repayment by the Eligible Employee.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements that are included in this Annual Report. 
      
  Overview of Our Business 
    
  CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively  CVS Health,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ), is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health. At the forefront of a changing health care landscape, the Company has an unmatched suite of capabilities and the expertise needed to drive innovations that will help shape the future of health. 
    
  We are currently the only integrated pharmacy health care company with the ability to impact consumers, payors, and providers with innovative, channel-agnostic solutions. We have a deep understanding of their diverse needs through our unique integrated model, and we are bringing them innovative solutions that help increase access to quality care, deliver better health outcomes, and lower overall health care costs.  
    
  Through our approximately 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in health care clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with more than 75 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year, and expanding specialty pharmacy services, we enable people, businesses, and communities to manage health in more affordable, effective ways. We are delivering break-through products and services, from advising patients on their medications at our CVS Pharmacy        locations, to introducing unique programs to help control costs for our clients at CVS Caremark       , to innovating how care is delivered to our patients with complex conditions through CVS Specialty   TM   , to improving pharmacy care for the senior community through Omnicare       , or by expanding access to high-quality, low-cost care at CVS MinuteClinic   TM   . 
    
  On   August 18, 2015  , the Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding common shares and voting interests of Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ), for   $98   per share for a total of   $9.6 billion   and assumed long-term debt with a fair value of approximately   $3.1 billion  . Omnicare is a leading pharmaceutical care company that specializes in the management of long-term care pharmacy services. As a result of the acquisition of Omnicare, the Company s segments have been expanded. The Company s Pharmacy Services Segment now also includes the specialty pharmacy operations of Omnicare. The Company s Retail Pharmacy Segment has been renamed the  Retail/LTC Segment  and now also includes the long-term care ( LTC ) operations, as well as the commercialization services of Omnicare. The LTC operations include the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings.  
    
  On December 16, 2015, we completed our acquisition of the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target Corporation ( Target ). This acquisition expands our pharmacy and clinic presence in existing and new markets. It allows us to increase patient access and is an investment in our core business to drive growth. The results of the Target pharmacies and clinics are included in our Retail/LTC Segment. 
    
  We have three reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. 
    
    Overview of Our Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  Our Pharmacy Services business generates revenue from a full range of pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) solutions, including plan design and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. 
    
  Our clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans and other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States. A portion of covered lives primarily within the Managed Medicaid, health plan and employer markets have access to our services through public and private exchanges.  
    
  As a pharmacy benefits manager, we manage the dispensing of prescription drugs through our mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, long-term care pharmacies and national network of more than   68,000   retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately   41,000   chain pharmacies (which includes our CVS Pharmacy        stores) and   27,000   independent pharmacies, to  
    1 

eligible members in the benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems to perform, among other things, safety checks, drug interaction screenings and brand to generic substitutions. 
    
  Our specialty pharmacies support individuals who require complex and expensive drug therapies. Our specialty pharmacy business includes mail order and retail specialty pharmacies that operate under the CVS Caremark       , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , Navarro        Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts names. Substantially all of our mail service specialty pharmacies have been accredited by The Joint Commission, which is an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies health care organizations and programs in the United States. We also offer specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition services through Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ). With Specialty Connect   TM   , which integrates our specialty pharmacy mail and retail capabilities, we provide members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to any CVS Pharmacy location. Whether submitted through our mail order pharmacy or at a CVS Pharmacy, all prescriptions are filled through the Company s specialty mail order pharmacies, so all revenue from this specialty prescription services program is recorded within the Pharmacy Services Segment. Members then can choose to pick up their medication at their local CVS Pharmacy or have it sent to their home through the mail. In August 2015, we expanded our offerings with the acquisition of Omnicare which included its specialty pharmacy operating under the Advanced Care Scripts name. 
    
  We also provide health management programs, which include integrated disease management for 17 conditions, through our Accordant        rare disease management offering. The majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. 
    
  In addition, through our SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. We currently provide Medicare Part D plan benefits to approximately 5.0 million beneficiaries through SilverScript, including our individual and employer group waiver plans. 
    
  The Pharmacy Services Segment operates under the CVS Caremark        Pharmacy Services, Caremark       , CVS Caremark   TM   , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , Accordant       , SilverScript       , Coram       , CVS Specialty   TM   , NovoLogix       , Navarro        Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts names. As of December 31, 2015, the Pharmacy Services Segment operated   24   retail specialty pharmacy stores,   11   specialty mail order pharmacies,   five   mail order dispensing pharmacies, and   83   branches for infusion and enteral services, including approximately   73   ambulatory infusion suites and   six   centers of excellence, located in   40   states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. 
    
    Overview of Our Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  Our Retail/LTC Segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, personal care products, convenience foods, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise and greeting cards. With the acquisition of Omnicare, the Retail/LTC Segment now also includes the distribution of prescription drugs, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings, as well as commercialization services which are provided under the name RxCrossroads       . We added approximately   1,672   pharmacies through the acquisition of Target's pharmacies, thereby, expanding our presence in new and existing markets. The stores within Target will only sell prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs that are required to be behind the counter. Our Retail/LTC Segment derives the majority of its revenues through the sale of prescription drugs, which are dispensed by our more than 30,000 pharmacists. The role of our retail pharmacists is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services, including flu vaccinations as well as face-to-face patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies, closing gaps in care, and more cost-effective drug therapies. Our integrated pharmacy services model enables us to enhance access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes. 
    
  Our Retail/LTC Segment also provides health care services through our MinuteClinic        health care clinics. MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions, and deliver vaccinations. We believe our clinics provide high quality services that are affordable and convenient. Through the acquisition of Target's clinics, we added   79   clinics in December 2015. 
    
  Our proprietary loyalty card program, ExtraCare       , has about 70 million active cardholders, making it one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty card programs in the country. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, our Retail/LTC Segment included   9,655   retail stores (of which   7,897   were our stores that operated a pharmacy and   1,672   were our pharmacies located within Target store) located in   49   states, the District of Columbia, Puerto  
    2 

Rico and Brazil operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy       , CVS       , Longs Drugs       ,     Navarro Discount Pharmacy        and Drogaria Onofre   TM    names,   32   onsite pharmacies primarily operating under the CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , CarePlus        and CVS Pharmacy        names, and   1,135   retail health care clinics operating under the MinuteClinic        name (of which   1,049   were located in CVS Pharmacy stores), and our online retail websites, CVS.com       , Navarro.com   TM      and Onofre.com.br   TM   . LTC operations are comprised of   143   spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders, of which   32   are also hub pharmacies that use proprietary automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC operates primarily under the Omnicare        and NeighborCare        names. 
    
    Overview of Our Corporate Segment 
    
  The Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of our executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, corporate information technology and finance departments. 
    
    Results of Operations 
    
  Summary of our Consolidated Financial Results 

Net revenues   increased $13.9 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, and increased $12.6 billion in 2014 compared to 2013. As you review our performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information: 

During 2015, net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased 13.5% and net revenues in our Retail/LTC Segment increased 6.2% compared to the prior year. 

During 2014, net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased by 16.1% and net revenues in our Retail/LTC Segment increased 3.3% compared to the prior year. 

Both segments benefited from the Omnicare acquisition that occurred in August 2015. 
       
    3 

Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about our net revenues. 
    
  Gross profit   increased $1.2 billion, or 4.6% in 2015, to $26.5 billion, as compared to $25.4 billion in 2014. Gross profit increased $1.6 billion, or 6.7% in 2014, to $25.4 billion, as compared to $23.8 billion in 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined to 17.3%, as compared to 18.2% in 2014 and 18.8% in 2013. 

During 2015, gross profit in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment increased by 9.6% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit as a percent of net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment was 5.2% and 30.5%, respectively. 

During 2014, gross profit in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment increased by 12.6% and 5.8%, respectively, compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2014, gross profit as a percent of net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment was 5.4% and 31.4%, respectively. 

The increased weighting toward the Pharmacy Services Segment, which has a lower gross profit than the Retail/LTC Segment, resulted in a decline in consolidated gross profit as a percent of net revenues in 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, gross profit for 2015, 2014 and 2013 has been negatively impacted by price compression in the Pharmacy Services Segment and reimbursement pressure in the Retail/LTC Segment.  

Our gross profit continued to benefit from the increased utilization of generic drugs (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs) in both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments for 2013 through 2015, partially offsetting the negative impacts described above.  
       
  Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about our gross profit. 
    
  Operating expenses   increased $506 million, or 3.0%, in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenues declined to 11.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 11.9% in the prior year. The increase in operating expense dollars in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to incremental store operating costs associated with a higher store count, the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015 and the acquisition of the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses in December 2015. The decrease in operating expenses as a percent of net revenues in 2015 is primarily due to expense leverage from net revenue growth. 
    
  Operating expenses increased $882 million, or 5.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenues declined to 11.9% in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 12.4% in the prior year. The increase in operating expense dollars in the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to incremental store operating costs associated with a higher store count, as well as legal costs and strategic initiatives as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2013 included a $72 million gain on a legal settlement. The improvement in operating expenses as a percent of net revenues in 2014 is primarily due to expense leverage from net revenue growth and disciplined expense control. 
    
  Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about operating expenses. 
    
  Interest expense, net   for the years ended December 31 consisted of the following: 

Net interest expense increased $238 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the amortization of bridge facility fees of $52 million for the unsecured bridge facility that was entered into on May 20, 2015 and was amortized to interest expense over the period it was outstanding, the $15 billion debt issuance in July 2015, and the debt assumed from the Omnicare acquisition. See Note 6,  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. During 2014, net interest expense increased by $91 million, to $600 million compared to 2013, primarily due to the issuance of $4 billion of debt in December 2013 and $1.5 billion of debt in August 2014. 
    
    4 

Loss on early extinguishment of debt   - During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company completed a $2.0 billion tender offer and repurchase of certain Senior Notes. The Company paid a premium of $490 million in excess of the debt principal in connection with the repurchase of the Senior Notes, wrote off $26 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $5 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $521 million. See Note 6,  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
    
  Income tax provision   - Our effective income tax rate was 39.3%, 39.5% and 38.9% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to certain permanent items in 2014. The effective income tax rate was higher in 2014 than in 2013 primarily due to certain permanent items in 2014.  
    
  Income from continuing operations   increased $585 million or 12.6% to $5.2 billion in 2015. Income from continuing operations increased $45 million or 1.0% to $4.6 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013. The 2015 and 2014 increases in income from continuing operations were primarily related to increases in generic dispensing rates and increased prescription volume for both operating segments. The increase in 2015 was negatively affected by $272 million of acquisition-related bridge financing, transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Omnicare and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. In addition, as discussed above, income from continuing operations included a $521 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2014, which positively impacted the growth rate in 2015 and negatively impacted the growth rate in 2014. 
    
    Income (loss) from discontinued operations   -     In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens  n Things, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The Company's income from discontinued operations in 2015 of $9 million, net of tax, was related to the release of certain store lease guarantees due to the settlement of a dispute with a landlord. The Company s loss from discontinued operations includes lease-related costs required to satisfy its Linens  n Things lease guarantees. We incurred a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $1 million and $8 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
    
  See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies - Discontinued Operations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about discontinued operations and Note 12  Commitments and Contingencies  for additional information about our lease guarantees. 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest   of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents the noncontrolling shareholders  portion of the net income from several less than wholly owned entities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company had two consolidated entities with immaterial noncontrolling interests. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company did not consolidate any entities that were not wholly owned by the Company. 
    
  Net income attributable to CVS Health   increased $593 million or 12.8% to $5.2 billion (or $4.63 per diluted share) in 2015. This compares to $4.6 billion (or $3.96 per diluted share) in 2014 and $4.6 billion (or $3.74 per diluted share) in 2013. As discussed previously, the 2015 increase in net income attributable to CVS Health was primarily related to increased generic drug dispensing and increased prescription volume in both operating segments, as well as the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2014. The increase in 2015 was negatively affected by $272 million of acquisition-related bridge financing, transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Omnicare and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. The increase in net income attributable to CVS Health per diluted share was also driven by increased share repurchase activity in 2015, 2014 and 2013. The net income attributable to CVS Health and per diluted share in 2014 includes a $521 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, which negatively impacted the net income growth rate in 2014.

Segment Analysis 
    
  We evaluate the performance of our Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments based on net revenues, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate Segment based on operating expenses before the effect of discontinued operations, nonrecurring charges and gains, and certain intersegment activities. The following is a reconciliation of the Company s business segments to the consolidated financial statements: 

(1) 
    Net revenues of the Pharmacy Services Segment include approximately   $8.9 billion  ,   $8.1 billion   and   $7.9 billion   of Retail Co-Payments for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Retail Co-Payments.  
              (2) 
    Intersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services Segment and the Retail/LTC Segment. These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients ( members ) fill prescriptions at retail stores to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice        elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at a retail drugstore instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at long-term care facilities. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis. 
              (3) 
    For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Corporate Segment operating loss includes   $156 million   of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs and a   $90 million   charge related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 legal settlement by MedPartners of various securities class actions and a related derivative claim.  
              (4) 
    Consolidated operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes a   $72 million   gain on a legal settlement, of which,   $11 million   is included in the Pharmacy Services Segment and   $61 million   is included in the Retail/LTC Segment.

Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  The following table summarizes our Pharmacy Services Segment s performance for the respective periods: 

(1) 
    Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail facility, which includes specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect claims filled at retail, as well as prescriptions filled at retail under the Maintenance Choice program.  
              (2) 
    Pharmacy network net revenues, claims processed and generic dispensing rates do not include Maintenance Choice, which are included within the mail choice category. Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty pharmacies, including our retail drugstores and long-term care pharmacies, but excluding Maintenance Choice activity. 
       
  Net revenues   in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased $11.9 billion, or 13.5%, to $100.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, driven by new clients, increased volume from new products and the addition of the specialty pharmacy operations of Omnicare, as well as inflation and increased pharmacy network claims. Conversely, the increase in our generic dispensing rate had a negative impact on our revenue in 2015, as it did in 2014. 
    
  Net revenues increased $12.2 billion, or 16.1%, to $88.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, including the acquisition of Coram and the impact of Specialty Connect, and increased pharmacy network volume. Conversely, the increase in our generic dispensing rate had a negative impact on our revenue in 2014, as it did in 2013. 
    
  As you review our Pharmacy Services Segment s revenue performance, we believe you should also consider the following important information: 

Our mail choice claims processed increased 4.0% to 85.7 million claims in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 82.4 million claims in the prior year. The increase in mail choice claims was driven by net new business, specialty and continuing adoption of our Maintenance Choice offerings. During 2014, our mail choice claims processed decreased 1.1% to 82.4 million claims. The decrease in mail choice claims was driven by a decline in traditional mail volumes, which was mostly offset by growth in our Maintenance Choice program and specialty pharmacy. 
       
     7 

primarily due to the acquisition of Coram and drug inflation particularly in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by increases in the percentage of generic prescription drugs dispensed and changes in client pricing.  

Our pharmacy network claims processed increased 9.0% to 926.2 million claims in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 849.6 million claims in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to net new business. During 2014, our pharmacy network claims processed increased 3.8% to 849.6 million compared to 818.8 million pharmacy network claims processed in 2013. This increase was primarily due to net new business and growth in Managed Medicaid, partially offset by a decrease in Medicare Part D claims. Medicare Part D claims were negatively affected by the CMS sanctions that were in place during 2013.  

Our average revenue per pharmacy network claim processed remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. During 2014, our average revenue per pharmacy network claim processed increased by 7.5%, compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to drug inflation and changes in the drug mix, partially offset by increases in the generic dispensing rate. 

Our mail choice generic dispensing rate was 76.4%, 74.6% and 72.6% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our pharmacy network generic dispensing rate increased to 84.4% in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 83.0% in the prior year. During 2014, our pharmacy network generic dispensing rate increased to 83.0% compared to our pharmacy network generic dispensing rate of 81.3% in 2013. These continued increases in mail choice and pharmacy network generic dispensing rates were primarily due to the impact of new generic drug introductions, and our continuous efforts to encourage plan members to use generic drugs when they are available. We believe our generic dispensing rates will continue to increase in future periods, albeit at a slower pace. This increase will be affected by, among other things, the number of new generic drug introductions and our success at encouraging plan members to utilize generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate. 

We completed the rollout of Specialty Connect   TM    in May 2014, which integrates the Company s specialty pharmacy mail and retail capabilities, providing members with the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to any CVS Pharmacy        location. Whether submitted through our mail order pharmacy or at CVS Pharmacy, all prescriptions are filled through the Company s specialty mail order pharmacies, so all revenue from this specialty prescription services program is recorded within the Pharmacy Services Segment.  

The Pharmacy Services Segment recognizes revenues from its pharmacy network transactions based on individual contract terms. Our Pharmacy Services Segment contracts are predominantly accounted for using the gross method. See the  Revenue Recognition  description under  Critical Accounting Policies  later in this section for further information on our revenue recognition policy. 
       
  Gross profit   in our Pharmacy Services Segment includes net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues includes (i) the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed, either directly through our mail service and specialty retail pharmacies or indirectly through our pharmacy network, (ii) shipping and handling costs and (iii) the operating costs of our mail service dispensing pharmacies, customer service operations and related information technology support. 
    
  Gross profit increased $456 million, or 9.6% to $5.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 5.4% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to volume increases and higher generic dispensing, as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics, partially offset by price compression. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to price compression, partially offset by favorable generic dispensing, as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics. 
    
  During 2014, gross profit increased $534 million, or 12.6% to $4.8 billion in the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 5.6% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to volume increases, higher generic dispensing and favorable purchasing economics, partially offset by price compression. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was due to price compression, partially offset by favorable generic dispensing and purchasing economics. In addition, gross profit dollars and margin for the year ended December 31, 2014, were positively impacted by $16 million related to the favorable resolution of previously proposed retroactive reimbursement rate changes in the State of California Medicaid program.

As you review our Pharmacy Services Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information: 

Our gross profit dollars and gross profit as a percentage of net revenues continued to be impacted by our efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates and/or discounts we received from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused us and other PBMs to continue to share a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers with clients. In addition, market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network  differential  or  spread . We expect these trends to continue. The  differential  or  spread  is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider. The increased use by patients of generic drugs has positively impacted our gross profit margins but has resulted in third party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments for prescriptions. This trend, which we expect to continue, reduces the benefit we realize from brand to generic product conversions. 

We review our network contracts on an individual basis to determine if the related revenues should be accounted for using the gross method or net method under the applicable accounting rules. Our Pharmacy Services Segment network contracts are predominantly accounted for using the gross method, which results in higher revenues, higher cost of revenues and lower gross profit rates.  

Our gross profit as a percentage of revenues benefited from the increase in our total generic dispensing rate, which increased to 83.7% and 82.2% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to our generic dispensing rate of 80.5% in 2013. These increases were primarily due to new generic drug introductions and our continued efforts to encourage plan members to use clinically appropriate generic drugs when they are available. We expect these trends to continue, albeit at a slower pace. 
       
  Operating expenses   in our Pharmacy Services Segment, which include selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization related to selling, general and administrative activities and retail specialty pharmacy store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs, decreased to 1.2% of net revenues in 2015, compared to 1.4% in 2014 and 1.5% in 2013. 
    
  As you review our Pharmacy Services Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information: 

Operating expenses decreased $19 million or 1.5%, to $1.2 billion, in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating expense dollars is primarily due to lower integration costs from the Coram acquisition which occurred in January 2014, partially offset by the addition of the specialty pharmacy operations of Omnicare from the acquisition in August 2015. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues improved slightly from 1.4% in 2014 to 1.2% in 2015.  

During 2014, the increase in operating expenses of $106 million or 9.2%, to $1.3 billion compared to 2013, is primarily related to increased costs associated with infusion services due to the 2014 acquisition of Coram, as well as an $11 million gain from a legal settlement during the year ended December 31, 2013. The slight decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to expense leverage from net revenue growth.

Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  The following table summarizes our Retail/LTC Segment s performance for the respective periods: 

(1) 
    Operating expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 include   $52 million   and   $64 million  , respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs related to the acquisition of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. 
              (2) 
    Includes the adjustment to convert 90-day, non-specialty prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. 
              (3) 
    Same store sales and prescriptions exclude revenues from MinuteClinic, and revenue and prescriptions from stores in Brazil, LTC operations and from commercialization services. 
              (4) 
    Front store same store sales would have been approximately   520   basis points higher for the year ended December 31, 2015 if tobacco and the estimated associated basket sales were excluded from the year ended December 31, 2014. 
       
  Net revenues   increased approximately $4.2 billion, or 6.2%, to $72.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Omnicare, a same store sales increase of 1.7%, and net revenues from new and acquired stores, which accounted for approximately 160 basis points of our total net revenue percentage increase during the year. Net revenues increased $2.2 billion, or 3.3% to $67.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a same store sales increase of 2.1% and net revenues from new stores, which accounted for approximately 140 basis points of our total net revenue percentage increase during the year. Additionally, in 2015, 2014 and 2013 we continued to see a positive impact on our net revenues due to the growth of our Maintenance Choice program. 
    
  As you review our Retail/LTC Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information: 

Front store same store sales declined 5.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the Company s decision to stop selling tobacco products and softer customer traffic. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in basket size. On a comparable basis, front store same store sales would have been approximately 520 basis points higher for the year ended December 31, 2015 if tobacco and the estimated associated basket sales were excluded from the year ended December 31, 2014.  
       
    10 

Pharmacy same store sales rose 4.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. Pharmacy same store sales were positively impacted by same store script growth of 4.8%, partially offset by the impact of the increase in generic dispensing and reimbursement pressure.  

Pharmacy revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the conversion of brand name drugs to equivalent generic drugs, which typically have a lower selling price. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 390 and 160 basis points for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to recent generic introductions. The increase in the impact from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a larger impact from new generic drug introductions. In addition, our pharmacy revenue growth has also been affected by continued reimbursement pressure, the lack of significant new brand name drug introductions, as well as an increase in the number of over-the-counter remedies that were historically only available by prescription. 

Pharmacy revenue growth continued to benefit from increased utilization by Medicare Part D beneficiaries, our ability to attract and retain managed care customers and favorable industry trends. These trends include an aging American population; many  baby boomers  are now in their fifties and sixties and are consuming a greater number of prescription drugs, as well as expanded coverage from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively,  ACA ). In addition, the increased use of pharmaceuticals as the first line of defense for individual health care also contributed to the growing demand for pharmacy services. We believe these favorable industry trends will continue.  
       
  Gross profit   in our Retail/LTC Segment includes net revenues less the cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period and the related purchasing costs, warehousing costs, delivery costs and actual and estimated inventory losses. 
    
  Gross profit increased $715 million, or 3.4%, to approximately $22.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 30.5% in year ended December 31, 2015, from 31.4% in 2014. Gross profit increased $1.2 billion, or 5.8%, to $21.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 30.6% for the prior year.  
    
  The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily driven by the addition of LTC, same store sales and new store sales, increased generic dispensing, as well as favorable purchasing economics, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by increases in the generic dispensing rate, same store sales and new store sales, as well as favorable purchasing economics. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in 2015 was primarily driven by a decline in pharmacy margins due to continued reimbursement pressure, partially offset by favorable pharmacy purchasing economics, as well as increased front store margins due to changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in 2014 was primarily driven by increased pharmacy margins due to the positive impact of increased generic dispensing rates and increased front store margins, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in 2014 was also driven by the removal of tobacco products from our stores. 
    
  As you review our Retail/LTC Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information: 

Front store revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 26.5%, 28.8% and 30.5%, respectively. The decline in front store revenues as a percentage of total net revenues in 2015 and 2014 was largely due to the removal of tobacco products and the associated basket sales. On average, our gross profit on front store revenues is generally higher than our gross profit on pharmacy revenues. Pharmacy revenues as a percentage of total net revenues increased approximately 220, 120 and 60 basis points in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This was due to pharmacy revenues growing faster than front store revenues, as well as the acquisition of Omnicare. The mix effect from a higher proportion of pharmacy sales had a negative effect on our overall gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This negative effect was partially offset by increased generic drug dispensing rates, the removal of tobacco products from our stores, favorable purchasing economics and increased store brand penetration. 
       
    11 

During the year ended December 31, 2014, our front store gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily related to a change in the mix of products sold, including the removal of tobacco products from our stores, and higher store brand sales. 

Gross profit dollars and margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 were positively impacted by $53 million related to the favorable resolution of previously proposed retroactive reimbursement rate changes in the State of California s Medicaid program.  

Our pharmacy gross profit rates have been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, as well as changes in the mix of our business within pharmacy. In the event this trend accelerates, we may not be able to sustain our current rate of revenue growth and gross profit dollars could be adversely impacted. The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted our gross profit but has resulted in third party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which we expect to continue, reduces the benefit we realize from brand to generic product conversions. 

ACA made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and to reimbursement. One of these changes was the revision of the definition of Average Manufacturer Price ( AMP ) and the reimbursement formula for multi-source drugs. Changes in reporting of AMP or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by Medicaid and Medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors and/or could impact our ability to negotiate discounts or rebates with manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs or retail and mail pharmacies. See  Efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices  in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors within our 2015 Form 10-K, for additional information. 
       
  Operating expenses   in our Retail/LTC Segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses. 
    
  Operating expenses increased $347 million, or 2.4% to $14.9 billion, or 20.6% as a percentage of net revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $14.5 billion, or 21.4% as a percentage of net revenues, in the prior year. Operating expenses increased $671 million, or 4.8%, to $14.5 billion, or 21.4% as a percentage of net revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $13.8 billion, or 21.1% as a percentage of net revenues, in the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved primarily due to higher legal costs in the prior year and leverage gained from the addition of LTC net revenues. The increase in operating expense dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to the addition of LTC, including acquisition-related integration costs of $64 million, and incremental store operating costs associated with operating more stores. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased in 2014 primarily due to reimbursement rate pressure, the implementation of Specialty Connect, which reduced net revenues, and higher legal costs. The increase in operating expense dollars in 2014 and 2013 was the result of higher store operating costs associated with our increased store count, as well as higher legal costs. The results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 include gains from legal settlements of $21 million and $61 million, respectively. Additionally, in September 2014, the Retail/LTC Segment made a charitable contribution of $25 million to the CVS Foundation to fund future charitable giving. The foundation is a non-profit entity that focuses on health, education and community involvement programs. 
    
    Corporate Segment 
    
  Operating expenses   increased $241 million, or 30.3%, to $1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses increased $45 million, or 6.0%, to $796 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating expenses within the Corporate Segment include executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, corporate information technology and finance related costs. The increase in operating expenses in 2015 was primarily due to acquisition-related transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Omnicare and Target's pharmacy and clinic business, as well as a $90 million charge related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 settlement by MedPartners of various securities class actions and a related derivative claim. Total acquisition-related transaction and integration costs recorded in the Corporate Segment for both acquisitions were   $156 million   and the charge for the lawsuit was   $90 million   for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating expenses in 2014 was primarily due to increased strategic initiatives, benefits costs, facilities management and information technology costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to cover our cash needs in the short-term. Over the long-term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. We believe our operating cash flows, commercial paper program, sale-leaseback program, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. 
    
  The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 

Net cash provided by operating activities   increased by   $275 million   in 2015 and $2.4 billion in 2014. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to increased net income partially offset by various changes in working capital. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to increased net income and increased accounts payable due to payables management and timing.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities   increased by   $9.4 billion   in 2015 and increased by $2.2 billion in 2014. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to the $9.6 billion paid for the acquisition of Omnicare and the $1.9 billion paid for the acquisition of the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses in 2015, compared to the $2.1 billion paid for the Coram acquisition in 2014. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to the $2.1 billion paid for the acquisition of Coram and an increase in capital expenditures. 
    
  In 2015, gross capital expenditures totaled approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $231 million compared to the prior year. During 2015, approximately 36% of our total capital expenditures were for new store construction, 21% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements and 43% were for technology and other corporate initiatives. Gross capital expenditures totaled approximately $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion during 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2014, approximately 42% of our total capital expenditures were for new store construction, 21% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements and 37% were for technology and other corporate initiatives. 
    
  Proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions totaled   $411 million   in 2015. This compares to   $515 million   in 2014 and   $600 million   in 2013. Under the sale-leaseback transactions, the properties are generally sold at net book value, which generally approximates fair value, and the resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. The specific timing and amount of future sale-leaseback transactions will vary depending on future market conditions and other factors. 
    
  Below is a summary of our store development activity for the respective years: 

(1)         Relocated stores are not included in new or closed store totals.  
  (2)         Includes retail drugstores, onsite pharmacy stores, specialty pharmacy stores and pharmacies within Target stores. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities   increased by   $10.7 billion   in 2015 and cash used in financing activities increased by $4.5 billion in 2014. The increase cash received in 2015 was primarily due to higher net borrowings in 2015 including the $14.8 billion in net proceeds received from the July 2015 debt issuance, partially offset by an increase in share repurchases of  
    13 

$1.0 billion. The increase in cash used in 2014 was primarily due to the repayments of long-term debt and lower borrowings than in 2013.  
    
  Share repurchase programs     The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2014 Repurchase Program may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. The 2013 and 2012 Repurchase Programs have been completed, as described below. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a   $725 million   fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ). Upon payment of the   $725 million   purchase price on December 14, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR or approximately   6.2 million   shares. At the conclusion of the ASR program, the Company may receive additional shares equal to the remaining   20%   of the   $725 million   notional amount. The initial   6.2 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in December 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $580 million and a forward contract for $145 million. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet. On January 28, 2016, the Company received   1.4 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   1.4 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in January 2016 and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2013 Repurchase Programs, effective January 2, 2015, the Company entered into a   $2.0 billion   fixed dollar ASR agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( JP Morgan ). Upon payment of the   $2.0 billion   purchase price on January 5, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately   16.8 million   shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2015. On May 1, 2015, the Company received approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   3.1 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by JP Morgan were placed into treasury stock in May 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for   $1.6 billion   and a forward contract for   $0.4 billion  . The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was initially recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet and was reclassified to treasury stock upon the settlement of the ASR in May 2015.  
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2012 Repurchase Program, effective October 1, 2013, the Company entered into a   $1.7 billion   fixed dollar ASR agreement with Barclays. Upon payment of the   $1.7 billion   purchase price on October 1, 2013, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   50%   of the   $1.7 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately   14.9 million   shares at a price of   $56.88   per share. The Company received approximately   11.7 million   shares of common stock on December 30, 2013 at an average price of   $63.83   per share, representing the remaining   50%   of the   $1.7 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement and thereby concluding the agreement. The total of   26.6 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays over the term of the October 2013 ASR agreement were placed into treasury stock. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction and a forward contract. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument.  
    
  Each of the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude each ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.  
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repurchased an aggregate of   48.0 million   shares of common stock for approximately   $5.0 billion   under the 2013 and 2014 Repurchase Programs. As of December 31, 2015, there remained an  
    14 

aggregate of approximately   $7.7 billion   available for future repurchases under the 2014 Repurchase Program and the 2013 Repurchase Program was complete. 
    
  Short-term borrowings   - We did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2015. In connection with our commercial paper program, we maintain a $1.00 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on May 23, 2018, a $1.25 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on July 24, 2019, and a $1.25 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on July 1, 2020. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately   0.03%  , regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding under the back-up credit facilities.  
    
  On May 20, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Omnicare, the Company entered into a   $13 billion   unsecured bridge loan facility. The Company paid approximately   $52 million   in fees in connection with the facility. The fees were capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility was outstanding. The bridge loan facility expired on July 20, 2015 upon the Company s issuance of unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal of   $15 billion   as discussed below. The bridge loan facility fees were fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Long-term borrowings   - On July 20, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of   $2.25 billion   of   1.9%     unsecured senior notes due 2018   ( 2018 Notes ), an aggregate of   $2.75 billion   of   2.8%     unsecured senior notes due 2020   ( 2020 Notes ), an aggregate of   $1.5 billion   of   3.5%     unsecured senior notes due 2022   ( 2022 Notes ), an aggregate of   $3 billion   of   3.875%     unsecured senior notes due 2025   ( 2025 Notes ), an aggregate of   $2 billion   of   4.875%     unsecured senior notes due 2035   ( 2035 Notes ), and an aggregate of   $3.5 billion   of   5.125%     unsecured senior notes due 2045   ( 2045 Notes  and, together with the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2035 Notes, the  Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $14.8 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The Notes pay interest semi-annually and contain redemption terms which allow or require the Company to redeem the Notes at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest at the redemption date. The net proceeds of the Notes were used to fund the Omnicare acquisition and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
    
  Upon the closing of the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015, the Company assumed the long-term debt of Omnicare that had a fair value of approximately   $3.1 billion  ,   $2.0 billion   of which was previously convertible into Omnicare shares that holders were able to redeem subsequent to the acquisition. During the period from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015, all but   $5 million   of the   $2.0 billion   of previously convertible debt was redeemed and repaid and approximately   $0.4 billion   in Omnicare term debt assumed was repaid for total repayments of Omnicare debt of approximately   $2.4 billion   in 2015.  
    
  The remaining principal of the Omnicare debt assumed was comprised of senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $700 million   (  $400 million   of   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and   $300 million   of   5% senior notes due 2024  ). In September 2015, the Company commenced exchange offers for the   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and the   5% senior notes due 2024   to exchange all validly tendered and accepted notes issued by Omnicare for notes to be issued by the Company. This offer expired on October 20, 2015 and the aggregate principal amounts below of each of the Omnicare notes were validly tendered and exchanged for notes issued by the Company. 

The Company recorded this exchange transaction as a modification of the original debt instruments. As such, no gain or loss on extinguishment was recognized in the Company's consolidated income statement as a result of this exchange transaction and issuance costs were expensed as incurred.  
    
  On August 7, 2014, the Company issued   $850 million   of   2.25%   unsecured senior notes due August 12, 2019 and   $650 million   of   3.375%   unsecured senior notes due August 12, 2024 (collectively, the  2014 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $1.5 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2014 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole  
    15 

at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company s option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2014 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repay certain corporate debt. 
    
  On August 7, 2014, the Company announced tender offers for any and all of the   6.25%   Senior Notes due 2027, and up to a maximum amount of the   6.125%   Senior Notes due 2039, the   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2041 and the   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2017, for up to an aggregate principal amount of   $1.5 billion  . On August 21, 2014, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the tender offers to   $2.0 billion   and completed the repurchase for the maximum amount on September 4, 2014. The Company paid a premium of   $490 million   in excess of the debt principal in connection with the tender offers, wrote off   $26 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred   $5 million   in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of   $521 million  . The loss was recorded in income from continuing operations in the condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased the remaining   $41 million   of outstanding Enhanced Capital Advantage Preferred Securities ( ECAPS ) at par. The fees and write-off of deferred issuance costs associated with the early extinguishment of the ECAPS were immaterial. 
    
  On December 2, 2013, the Company issued   $750 million   of   1.2%   unsecured senior notes due December 5, 2016;   $1.25 billion   of   2.25%   unsecured senior notes due December 5, 2018;   $1.25 billion   of   4%   unsecured senior notes due December 5, 2023; and   $750 million   of   5.3%   unsecured senior notes due December 5, 2043 (the  2013 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $4.0 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2013 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company s option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2013 Notes were used to repay commercial paper outstanding at the time of issuance and to fund the acquisition of Coram in January 2014. The remainder was used for general corporate purposes.  
    
  Our backup credit facilities and unsecured senior notes (see Note 6,  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. 
    
  These covenants do not include a requirement for the acceleration of our debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in our credit rating. We do not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no outstanding derivative financial instruments. 
    
  Debt Ratings   - As of December 31, 2015, our long-term debt was rated  Baa1  by Moody s with a stable outlook and  BBB+  by Standard   Poor s with a stable outlook, and our commercial paper program was rated  P-2  by Moody s and  A-2  by Standard   Poor s. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody s and Standard   Poor s considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information. Although we currently believe our long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, we cannot guarantee the future actions of Moody s and/or Standard   Poor s. Our debt ratings have a direct impact on our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. 
    
  Quarterly Dividend Increase   - In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a 21% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.425 per share effective in 2016. This increase equates to an annual dividend rate of $1.70 per share. In December 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a 27% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.35 per share. This increase equated to an annual dividend rate of $1.40 per share. In December 2013, our Board of directors authorized a 22% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.275 per share. This increase equated to an annual dividend rate of $1.10 per share.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  In connection with executing operating leases, we provide a guarantee of the lease payments. We also finance a portion of our new store development through sale-leaseback transactions, which involve selling stores to unrelated parties and then leasing the stores back under leases that generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. We do not have any retained or contingent interests in the stores, and we do not provide any guarantees, other than a guarantee of the lease payments, in connection with the transactions. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our operating leases are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Between 1991 and 1997, we sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob s Stores, Linens  n Things, Marshalls, Kay-Bee Toys, This End Up and Footstar. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the store s lease obligations. When the subsidiaries were disposed of, the Company s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser agreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries were to become insolvent and failed to make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy these obligations. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, we guaranteed approximately   72   such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens  n Things), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2026. Management believes the ultimate disposition of any of the remaining lease guarantees will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or future cash flows. Please see  Income (loss) from discontinued operations  previously in this document for further information regarding our guarantee of certain Linens  n Things  store lease obligations. 
    
  Below is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015: 

(1) 
    The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target. See Note 7,  Leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the lease arrangements with Target. Amounts related to the operating and capital leases with Target are reflected within the operating leases and capital lease obligations above. Amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic lives of the buildings are reflected herein assuming equivalent stores continue to operate through the term of the arrangements. 
              (2) 
    Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated on outstanding balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2015

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered, support the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. 
    
  Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  Our Pharmacy Services Segment sells prescription drugs directly through our mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through our retail pharmacy network. We recognize revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment from prescription drugs sold by our mail service dispensing pharmacies and under retail pharmacy network contracts where we are the principal using the gross method at the contract prices negotiated with our clients. Net revenue from our Pharmacy Services Segment includes: (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to us, net of any volume-related or other discounts paid back to the client, (ii) the price paid to us ( Mail Co-Payments ) or a third party pharmacy in our retail pharmacy network ( Retail Co-Payments ) by individuals included in our clients  benefit plans, and (iii) administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts where we are not the principal. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 
    
  We recognize revenue in the Pharmacy Services Segment when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Pharmacy Services Segment. 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription is delivered. At the time of delivery, the Pharmacy Services Segment has performed substantially all of its obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments. 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Pharmacy Services Segment s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Pharmacy Services Segment s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Pharmacy Services Segment s online claims processing system. 
       
  We determine whether we are the principal or agent for our retail pharmacy network transactions on a contract by contract basis. In the majority of our contracts, we have determined we are the principal due to us: (i) being the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) having latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) having discretion in supplier selection, (iv) having involvement in the determination of product or service specifications, and (v) having credit risk. Our obligations under our client contracts for which revenues are reported using the gross method are separate and distinct from our obligations to the third party pharmacies included in our retail pharmacy network contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, we are contractually required to pay the third party pharmacies in our retail pharmacy network for products sold, regardless of whether we are paid by our clients. Our responsibilities under these client contracts typically include validating eligibility and coverage levels, communicating the prescription price and the co-payments due to the third party retail pharmacy, identifying possible adverse drug interactions for the pharmacist to address with the physician prior to dispensing, suggesting clinically appropriate generic alternatives where appropriate and approving the prescription for dispensing. Although we do not have credit risk with respect to Retail Co-Payments or inventory risk related to retail network claims, we believe that all of the other indicators of gross revenue reporting are present. For contracts under which we act as an agent, we record revenues using the net method. 
    
  We deduct from our revenues the manufacturers  rebates that are earned by our clients based on their members  utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. We estimate these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and our estimates of the manufacturers  rebates earned by our clients. We base our estimates on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. We adjust our rebates payable to  
    18 

clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. We record any cumulative effect of these adjustments against revenues as identified, and adjust our estimates prospectively to consider recurring matters. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with our clients or manufacturers, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates or whether the product was included in the applicable formulary. We also deduct from our revenues pricing guarantees and guarantees regarding the level of service we will provide to the client or member as well as other payments made to our clients. Because the inputs to most of these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility, the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual amounts have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. 
    
  We participate in the federal government s Medicare Part D program as a PDP through our SilverScript Insurance Company subsidiary. Our net revenues include insurance premiums earned by the PDP, which are determined based on the PDP s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with CMS. The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, but which is subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially deferred as accrued expenses and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits. 
    
  In addition to these premiums, our net revenues include co-payments, coverage gap benefits, deductibles and co-insurance (collectively, the  Member Co-Payments ) related to PDP members  actual prescription claims. In certain cases, CMS subsidizes a portion of these Member Co-Payments and we are paid an estimated prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy, each month. The prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amounts received from CMS are also included in our net revenues. We assume no risk for these amounts, which represented 6.3%, 6.4% and 7.0% of consolidated net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. If the prospective Member Co-Payment subsidies received differ from the amounts based on actual prescription claims, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable or accrued expenses. We account for fully insured CMS obligations and Member Co-Payments (including the amounts subsidized by CMS) using the gross method consistent with our revenue recognition policies for Mail Co-Payments and Retail Co-Payments. We have recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from our participation in the Medicare Part D program based on information in our claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from our participation in the Medicare Part D program include: (i) estimates of low-income cost subsidy, reinsurance amounts and coverage gap discount amounts ultimately payable to or receivable from CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation, (ii) an estimate of amounts payable to CMS under a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor and (iii) estimates for claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported. Actual amounts of Medicare Part D-related assets and liabilities could differ significantly from amounts recorded. Historically, the effect of these adjustments has not been material to our results of operations or financial position. 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  Retail Pharmacy   - We recognize revenue from the sale of front store merchandise at the time the merchandise is purchased by the retail customer and recognize revenue from the sale of prescription drugs when the prescription is picked up by the customer. Customer returns are not material. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 
    
  Long-term Care   - We recognize revenue when products are delivered or services are rendered or provided to our customers, prices are fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A significant portion of our revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products are reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. Payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges. We monitor our revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as other third party insurance payors, and record an estimated contractual allowances for sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date, to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total net sales and receivables reported in our consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Since billing functions for a portion of our revenue systems are largely computerized, enabling on-line adjudication at the time of sale to record net revenues, our exposure in connection with estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims (typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor). For the remaining portion of our revenue systems, the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed, unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims. We evaluate several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis, including historical trends based on actual claims paid, current contract and reimbursement terms, and changes in customer base and payor/product mix. Contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled, and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments was not significant to our results of operations. Further, we do not expect the impact of changes in estimates related to unsettled contractual allowance amounts from Medicare, Medicaid and third party payors as of December 31, 2015 to be significant to our future consolidated results of operation, financial position and cash flows.  
    19 

Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of our normal billing procedures and subject to our normal accounts receivable collections procedures. 
    
  Health Care Clinics   - for services provided by our health care clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates. 
    
  Loyalty Program   - our customer loyalty program, ExtraCare       , is comprised of two components, ExtraSavings   TM    and ExtraBucks        Rewards. ExtraSavings coupons redeemed by customers are recorded as a reduction of revenues when redeemed. ExtraBucks Rewards are accrued as a charge to cost of revenues when earned, net of estimated breakage. We determine breakage based on our historical redemption patterns. 
    
  Allowances for Doubtful Accounts 
    
  Accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies, governmental agencies and long-term care facilities), clients, members and private pay customers, as well as vendors and manufacturers. We provide a reserve for accounts receivable considered to be at increased risk of becoming uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We establish this allowance for doubtful accounts and consider such factors as historical collection experience, (i.e., payment history and credit losses) and creditworthiness, specifically identified credit risks, aging of accounts receivable by payor category, current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors. We regularly review our allowance for doubtful accounts for appropriateness. Judgment is used to assess the collectability of account balances and the economic ability of a customer to pay. 
    
  Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2015 was $161 million, compared with $256 million as of December 31, 2014. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 1.3% and 2.6% of gross receivables (net of contractual allowance adjustments) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Unforeseen future developments could lead to changes in our provision for doubtful accounts levels and future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages. For example, a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables as of December 31, 2015 would result in an increase to the provision of doubtful accounts of approximately $120 million. 
    
  Given our experience, we believe that our aggregate reserves for potential losses are adequate, but if any of our larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations, our overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate. In particular, if economic conditions worsen, the payor mix shifts significantly or reimbursement rates are adversely affected, we may adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly, and our accounts receivable collections, cash flows, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
    
  Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment 
    
  Our Pharmacy Services Segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services Segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the results of operations. We account for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Pharmacy Services Segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined annual purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services Segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of  Cost of revenues . 

20 

Retail/LTC Segment 
    
  Vendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC Segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract. 
    
  We have not made any material changes in the way we account for vendor allowances and purchase discounts during the past three years. 
    
  Inventory 
    
  Effective January 1, 2015, the Company changed its methods of accounting for  front store  inventories in the Retail/LTC Segment. Prior to 2015, the Company valued front store inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) basis in retail stores using the retail inventory method and in distribution centers using the FIFO cost method. Effective January 1, 2015, all front store inventories in the Retail/LTC Segment have been valued at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method. These changes affected approximately   36%   of consolidated inventories. 
    
  These changes were made primarily to provide the Company with better information to manage its retail front store operations and to bring all of the Company s inventories to a common inventory valuation methodology. The Company believes the weighted average cost method is preferable to the retail inventory method and the FIFO cost method because it results in greater precision in the determination of cost of revenues and inventories at the stock keeping unit ( SKU ) level and results in a consistent inventory valuation method for all of the Company s inventories as all of the Company s remaining inventories, which consist of prescription drugs, were already being valued using the weighted average cost method. 
    
  The Company recorded the cumulative effect of these changes in accounting principle as of January 1, 2015. The Company determined that retrospective application for periods prior to 2015 is impracticable, as the period-specific information necessary to value front store inventories in the Retail/LTC Segment under the weighted average cost method is unavailable. The Company implemented a new perpetual inventory system to manage front store inventory at the SKU level and valued front store inventory as of January 1, 2015 and calculated the cumulative impact. The effect of these changes in accounting principle as of January 1, 2015, was a decrease in inventories of   $7 million  , an increase in current deferred income tax assets of   $3 million   and a decrease in retained earnings of   $4 million  . 
    
  All prescription drug inventories in the Retail/LTC Segment have been valued at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method. The weighted average cost method is used to determine cost of sales and inventory in our mail service and specialty pharmacies in our Pharmacy Services Segment.  
    
  We reduce the value of our ending inventory for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are properly stated. The accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends. 
    
  Our total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $225 million as of December 31, 2015. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help you assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimated inventory losses, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our total reserve for estimated inventory losses by about $23 million as of December 31, 2015. 
    
    21 

Although we believe that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. 
    
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, client contracts and relationships, favorable leases and covenants not to compete. These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. 
    
  Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation techniques and management estimates. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 
    
  We evaluate the recoverability of certain long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, but excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are tested for impairment using separate tests, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We group and evaluate these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. When evaluating these long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group s carrying value that exceeds the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). Our long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate each asset group s future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, we consider historical results and current operating trends and our consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. 
    
  These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns. 
    
  Goodwill and indefinitely-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
    
  Indefinitely-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. 
    
  Our indefinitely-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the fair value based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as the profitability of the Company. 
    
  Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis using a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the reporting unit s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flow valuation model and comparable market transaction models. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
    
  The determination of the fair value of our reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include, but are not limited to, the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates, terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating profit, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, we  
    22 

consider each reporting unit s historical results and current operating trends and our consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results, forecasts and industry trends. Our estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, our market capitalization, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increase member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns. 
    
  The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets covered by this critical accounting policy was $38.1 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2015, respectively. We did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill or other intangible assets during 2015, 2014 or 2013. During the third quarter of 2015, we performed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitely-lived trademarks. The results of the impairment tests concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill or trademarks. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of our reporting units exceeding their carrying values by a significant margin.  
    
  Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to test for impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment tests. 
    
  We have not made any material changes in the methodologies utilized to test the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment during the past three years. 
    
  Closed Store Lease Liability 
    
  We account for closed store lease termination costs when a leased store is closed. When a leased store is closed, we record a liability for the estimated present value of the remaining obligation under the noncancelable lease, which includes future real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other charges, if applicable. The liability is reduced by estimated future sublease income. 
    
  The initial calculation and subsequent evaluations of our closed store lease liability contain uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the timing and duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future lump sum settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential future sublease income. When estimating these potential termination costs and their related timing, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. 
    
  Our total closed store lease liability covered by this critical accounting policy was $221 million as of December 31, 2015. This amount is net of $115 million of estimated sublease income that is subject to the uncertainties discussed above. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for sublease income, it is possible that actual results could differ. 
    
  In order to help you assess the risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimated sublease income, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our total closed store lease liability by about $12 million as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  We have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology used to record closed store lease reserves during the past three years. 
    
  Self-Insurance Liabilities 
    
  We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability, although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure. We are also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. 
    
  The estimate of our self-insurance liability contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. When estimating our self-insurance liability, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical claim experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions. On a quarterly basis, we review our self-insurance liability to determine if it is adequate as it relates to our general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability. Similar reviews are conducted semi-annually to determine if our self-insurance liability is adequate for our health and medical liability. 
    
    23 

Our total self-insurance liability covered by this critical accounting policy was $660 million as of December 31, 2015. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for our self-insurance liability, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help you assess the risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimate for our self-insurance liability, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our self-insurance liability by about $66 million as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three years. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those tax benefits is uncertain.  
    
  Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions. We have established accruals for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances. 
    
  Proposed Lease Accounting Standard Update 
    
  In May 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a revised proposed accounting standard update on lease accounting that will require entities to recognize assets and liabilities arising from lease contracts on the balance sheet. The proposed accounting standard update states that lessees and lessors should apply a  right-of-use model  in accounting for all leases. Under the proposed model, lessees would recognize an asset for the right to use the leased asset, and a liability for the obligation to make rental payments over the lease term. The Company cannot presently determine the potential impact the proposed standard would have on its results of operations. While the Company believes that the proposed standard, as currently drafted, will likely have a material impact on its financial position, it will not have a material impact on its liquidity; however, until the proposed standard is finalized, such evaluation cannot be completed. 
    
  See Note 1,  Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of New Accounting Pronouncements applicable to the Company.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the Company s ability to record, process, summarize and report a system of internal accounting controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets are prevented or timely detected and that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and receipts and expenditures are duly authorized. In order to ensure the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in   Internal Control-Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation, evaluation of the design effectiveness and testing of the operating effectiveness of controls. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by our internal auditors, written policies and procedures and a written Code of Conduct adopted by our Company s Board of Directors, applicable to all employees of our Company. In addition, we have an internal Disclosure Committee, comprised of management from each functional area within the Company, which performs a separate review of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls over financial reporting. 
    
  Management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting did not include two acquisitions, Omnicare, Inc. and the pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation, consummated during fiscal year 2015. Omnicare, Inc. and the Target Corporation pharmacy and clinic businesses are included in the Company's 2015 consolidated financial statements and represent 18% of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2% of net revenues for the year then ended. 
    
  Based on our assessment, we conclude our Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  Ernst   Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, is appointed by the Board of Directors and ratified by our Company s shareholders. They were engaged to render an opinion regarding the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements as well as conducting an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Their accompanying reports are based upon audits conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of CVS Health Corporation 
    
  We have audited CVS Health Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). CVS Health Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Omnicare, Inc. and the pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation, which are included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of CVS Health Corporation and constituted 18% of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2% of net revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of CVS Health Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Omnicare, Inc. and the pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation. 
    
  In our opinion, CVS Health Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria. 
    
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of CVS Health Corporation and our report dated February 9, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
    1    Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Description of business   - CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) is the largest integrated pharmacy health care provider in the United States based upon revenues and prescriptions filled. The Company currently has   three   reportable business segments, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate, which are described below. 
    
  Changes in Segment Definition -   As a result of the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ) on August 18, 2015, the Company's segments have been expanded. The Company s Pharmacy Services Segment now also includes the specialty pharmacy operations of Omnicare. The Company s former Retail Pharmacy Segment now also includes the long-term care ( LTC ) operations, as well as the commercialization services of Omnicare, and has been renamed the  Retail/LTC Segment.  The LTC operations include the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. The Company s Corporate Segment now also includes certain aspects of Omnicare's corporate expenses.  
    
  On December 16, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target Corporation ( Target ). See Note 3, "Acquisitions." The results of the Target pharmacies and clinics are included in the Retail/LTC Segment. 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment (the  PSS )   - The PSS provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management services including mail order pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, plan design and administration, formulary management and claims processing. The Company s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States.  
    
  As a pharmacy benefits manager, the PSS manages the dispensing of pharmaceuticals through the Company s mail order pharmacies and national network of more than   68,000   retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately   41,000   chain pharmacies and   27,000   independent pharmacies, to eligible members in the benefits plans maintained by the Company s clients and utilizes its information systems to perform, among other things, safety checks, drug interaction screenings and brand to generic substitutions. 
    
  The PSS  specialty pharmacies support individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies. The specialty pharmacy business includes mail order and retail specialty pharmacies that operate under the CVS Caremark       , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , Navarro        Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts names. In January 2014, the Company enhanced its offerings of specialty infusion services and began offering enteral nutrition services through Coram LLC and its subsidiaries. In August 2015, the Company further expanded its specialty offerings with the acquisition of Advanced Care Scripts which was part of the Omnicare acquisition. See Note 3,  Acquisitions .  
    
  The PSS also provides health management programs, which include integrated disease management for   17   conditions, through the Company s Accordant        rare disease management offering. 
    
  In addition, through the Company s SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, the PSS is a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. 
    
  The PSS generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs to plan members. Prescription drugs are dispensed by the mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies and national network of retail pharmacies. Net revenues are also generated by providing additional services to clients, including administrative services such as claims processing and formulary management, as well as health care related services such as disease management. 
    
  The pharmacy services business operates under the CVS Caremark        Pharmacy Services, Caremark       , CVS Caremark   TM   , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy   TM   , Accordant       , SilverScript       , Coram       , CVS Specialty   TM   , NovoLogix       , Navarro        Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts names. As of December 31, 2015, the PSS operated   24   retail specialty pharmacy stores,   11   specialty mail order pharmacies and   five   mail order dispensing pharmacies, and   83   branches for infusion and enteral services, including   73   ambulatory infusion suites and   six   centers of excellence, located in   40   states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment (the  RLS )   - The RLS sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience  
    34 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

foods, through the Company s CVS Pharmacy       , CVS       , Longs Drugs       , Navarro Discount Pharmacy        and Drogaria Onofre   TM    retail stores and online through CVS.com       , Navarro.com   TM    and Onofre.com.br   TM   .  
    
  The RLS also provides health care services through its MinuteClinic        health care clinics. MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions and deliver vaccinations. 
    
  With the acquisition of Omnicare, the RLS now includes LTC operations, which is comprised of providing the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings, as well as commercialization services which are provided under the name RxCrossroads       . With the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target, the Company added   1,672   pharmacies and approximately   79   clinics. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the retail pharmacy business included   9,655   retail stores (of which   7,897   were our stores that operated a pharmacy and   1,672   were our pharmacies located within a Target store) located in   49   states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy, CVS, Longs Drugs, Navarro Discount Pharmacy and Drogaria Onofre names, the online retail websites, CVS.com, Navarro.com and Onofre.com.br, and   1,135   retail health care clinics operating under the MinuteClinic name (of which   1,049   were located in CVS Pharmacy stores). LTC operations is comprised of   143   spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders and   32   hub pharmacies that use proprietary automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC operates primarily under the Omnicare        and NeighborCare        names. 
    
  Corporate Segment   - The Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of the Company s executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, corporate information technology and finance departments. 
    
  Principles of consolidation   - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  The Company continually evaluates its investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a VIE. If the Company determines that it has a variable interest in a VIE, the Company then evaluates if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether the Company has the ability to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. 
    
  Assets and liabilities of VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company s consolidated financial statements. VIE creditors do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company. 
    
  Use of estimates   - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Fair value hierarchy   - The Company utilizes the three-level valuation hierarchy for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and liabilities within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy consist of the following: 

Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument. 

Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon management s best estimate of inputs market participants could use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk. 
       
  Cash and cash equivalents   - Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-term money market funds, commercial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as  
    35 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. 
    
  Short-term investments   - The Company s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with initial maturities of greater than three months when purchased that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date. These investments, which were classified as available-for-sale within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, were carried at fair value, which approximated their historical cost at December 31, 2015 and 2014. 
    
  Fair value of financial instruments   - As of December 31, 2015, the Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, contingent consideration liability and short-term debt. Due to the nature of these instruments, the Company s carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of total long-term debt was   $27.5 billion   and   $28.4 billion  , respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was estimated based on quoted rates currently offered in active markets for the Company s debt, which is considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company had outstanding letters of credit, which guaranteed foreign trade purchases, with a fair value of   $4 million   as of December 31, 2015. There were no outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. 
    
  Foreign currency translation and transactions   - For local currency functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
    
  For U.S. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for non-monetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income. 
    
  Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements were not material for all periods presented. 
    
  Accounts receivable   - Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The accounts receivable balance primarily includes amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies, governmental agencies and long-term care facilities), clients, members and private pay customers, as well as vendors and manufacturers. Charges to bad debt are based on both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. 
    
  The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for the years ended December 31 is as follows: 

Inventories   - All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Prescription drug inventories in the RLS and PSS, as well as front store inventories in the RLS stores are accounted for using the weighted average cost method. See Note 2, "Changes in Accounting Principle." Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and long-term care pharmacy and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical results and current trends. 
    
  Property and equipment   - Property, equipment and improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or when applicable, the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives generally range from   10   to   40   years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements and   3   to   10   years for fixtures, equipment and internally developed software. Repair and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense  
    36 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Application development stage costs for significant internally developed software projects are capitalized and depreciated. 
    
  The following are the components of property and equipment at December 31:  

The gross amount of property and equipment under capital leases was   $528 million   and   $268 million   as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Accumulated amortization of property and equipment under capital lease was   $97 million   and   $86 million   as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amortization of property and equipment under capital lease is included within depreciation expense. Depreciation expense totaled   $1.5 billion   in 2015 and   $1.4 billion   in both 2014 and 2013. 
    
  Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets   - Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment reviews annually, or more frequently if necessary. See Note 4 for additional information on goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets. 
    
  Intangible assets   - Purchased customer contracts and relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives between   9   and   20   years. Purchased customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to   10   years. Purchased leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the lease. See Note 4 for additional information about intangible assets. 
    
  Impairment of long-lived assets   - The Company groups and evaluates fixed and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group s carrying value that exceeds the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). 
    
  Redeemable noncontrolling interest   - As a result of the acquisition of Omnicare in August 2015, the Company obtained a   73%   ownership interest in limited liability company ( LLC ). Due to the change in control in Omnicare, the noncontrolling member of the LLC had the contractual right to put its membership interest to the Company at fair value. Consequently, the noncontrolling interest in the LLC is recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at fair value. In January 2016, as provided for in the LLC operating agreement, the noncontrolling shareholder of the LLC exercised its option to sell its ownership interest in the LLC to the Company. On February 8, 2016, in accordance with the terms of the LLC operating agreement, the Company purchased the noncontrolling interest in the LLC at an amount determined pursuant to the operating agreement that approximated its carrying value at December 31, 2015. 
    
  Below is a summary of the changes in redeemable noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31, 2015:

Revenue Recognition 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment   - The PSS sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through its retail pharmacy network. The PSS recognizes revenue from prescription drugs sold by its mail service dispensing pharmacies and under retail pharmacy network contracts where it is the principal using the gross method at the contract prices negotiated with its clients. Net revenues include: (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the PSS, net of any volume-related or other discounts paid back to the client (see  Drug Discounts  below), (ii) the price paid to the PSS by client plan members for mail order prescriptions ( Mail Co-Payments ) and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions ( Retail Co-Payments ), and (iii) administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts where the PSS is not the principal as discussed below. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 
    
  Revenue is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the PSS: 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription is delivered. At the time of delivery, the PSS has performed substantially all of its obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments. 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the PSS  retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the PSS  point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the PSS online claims processing system. 
       
  The PSS determines whether it is the principal or agent for its retail pharmacy network transactions on a contract by contract basis. In the majority of its contracts, the PSS has determined it is the principal due to it: (i) being the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) having latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) having discretion in supplier selection, (iv) having involvement in the determination of product or service specifications, and (v) having credit risk. The PSS  obligations under its client contracts for which revenues are reported using the gross method are separate and distinct from its obligations to the third party pharmacies included in its retail pharmacy network contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, the PSS is contractually required to pay the third party pharmacies in its retail pharmacy network for products sold, regardless of whether the PSS is paid by its clients. The PSS  responsibilities under its client contracts typically include validating eligibility and coverage levels, communicating the prescription price and the co-payments due to the third party retail pharmacy, identifying possible adverse drug interactions for the pharmacist to address with the prescriber prior to dispensing, suggesting generic alternatives where clinically appropriate and approving the prescription for dispensing. Although the PSS does not have credit risk with respect to Retail Co-Payments or inventory risk related to retail network claims, management believes that all of the other applicable indicators of gross revenue reporting are present. For contracts under which the PSS acts as an agent, revenue is recognized using the net method. 
    
  Drug Discounts   - The PSS deducts from its revenues any rebates, inclusive of discounts and fees, earned by its clients. Rebates are paid to clients in accordance with the terms of client contracts, which are normally based on fixed rebates per prescription for specific products dispensed or a percentage of manufacturer discounts received for specific products dispensed. The liability for rebates due to clients is included in  Claims and discounts payable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Medicare Part D   - The PSS, through its SilverScript subsidiary, participates in the federal government s Medicare Part D program as a Prescription Drug Plan ( PDP ). Net revenues include insurance premiums earned by the PDP, which are determined based on the PDP s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). The insurance premiums include a direct premium paid by CMS and a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, but which is subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members. Premiums collected in advance are initially deferred in accrued expenses and are then recognized in net revenues over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits. 
    
  In addition to these premiums, net revenues include co-payments, coverage gap benefits, deductibles and co-insurance (collectively, the  Member Co-Payments ) related to PDP members  actual prescription claims. In certain cases, CMS subsidizes a portion of these Member Co-Payments and pays the PSS an estimated prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amount each month. The prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amounts received from CMS are also included in net revenues. SilverScript assumes no risk for these amounts. If the prospective Member Co-Payment subsidies received differ from the amounts based on actual prescription claims, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable or accrued expenses.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The PSS accounts for CMS obligations and Member Co-Payments (including the amounts subsidized by CMS) using the gross method consistent with its revenue recognition policies for Mail Co-Payments and Retail Co-Payments (discussed previously in this document). 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment    
    
  Retail Pharmacy   - The retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Customer returns are not material. Revenue generated from the performance of services in the RLS  health care clinics is recognized at the time the services are performed. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 
    
  Long-term Care   - Revenue is recognized when products are delivered or services are rendered or provided to the customer, prices are fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A significant portion of our revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products are reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. Payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as other third party insurance payors, and record an estimated contractual allowance for sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date, to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total net sales and receivables reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Since billing functions for a portion of the Company's revenue systems are largely computerized, enabling on-line adjudication at the time of sale to record net revenues, the Company's exposure in connection with estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims (typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor). For the remaining portion of the Company's revenue systems, the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed, unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims. The Company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis, including historical trends based on actual claims paid, current contract and reimbursement terms, and changes in customer base and payor/product mix. Contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled, and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments was not significant to our results of operations for any of the periods presented.  
    
  Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of our normal billing procedures and subject to our normal accounts receivable collections procedures. 
    
  Health Care Clinics   - For services provided by our health care clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates. 
    
  Loyalty Program   - The Company s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare       , is comprised of two components, ExtraSavings   TM    and ExtraBucks        Rewards. ExtraSavings coupons redeemed by customers are recorded as a reduction of revenues when redeemed. ExtraBucks Rewards are accrued as a charge to cost of revenues when earned, net of estimated breakage. The Company determines breakage based on historical redemption patterns. 
    
  See Note 13 for additional information about the revenues of the Company s business segments. 
    
  Cost of revenues 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment   - The PSS  cost of revenues includes: (i) the cost of prescription drugs sold during the reporting period directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through its retail pharmacy network, (ii) shipping and handling costs, and (iii) the operating costs of its mail service dispensing pharmacies and client service operations and related information technology support costs including depreciation and amortization. The cost of prescription drugs sold component of cost of revenues includes: (i) the cost of the prescription drugs purchased from manufacturers or distributors and shipped to members in clients  benefit plans from the PSS  mail service dispensing pharmacies, net of any volume-related or other discounts (see  Vendor allowances and purchase discounts  below) and (ii) the cost of prescription drugs sold (including Retail Co-Payments) through the PSS  retail pharmacy network under contracts where it is the principal, net of any volume-related or other discounts. 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment   - The RLS  cost of revenues includes: the cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period and the related purchasing costs, warehousing and delivery costs (including depreciation and amortization) and actual and estimated inventory losses.  
    39 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

See Note 13 for additional information about the cost of revenues of the Company s business segments. 
    
  Vendor allowances and purchase discounts 
    
  The Company accounts for vendor allowances and purchase discounts as follows: 
    
  Pharmacy Services Segment   - The PSS receives purchase discounts on products purchased. The PSS  contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the PSS to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices, or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within   30   days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the PSS  results of operations. The PSS accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The PSS also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined annual purchase volumes. In addition, the PSS receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of  Cost of revenues . 
    
  Retail/LTC Segment   - Vendor allowances received by the RLS reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract. The total amortization of these upfront payments was not material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Insurance   - The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability. The Company obtains third party insurance coverage to limit exposure from these claims. The Company is also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. The Company s self-insurance accruals, which include reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, are calculated using standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions and the Company s historical claims experience. 
    
  Facility opening and closing costs   - New facility opening costs, other than capital expenditures, are charged directly to expense when incurred. When the Company closes a facility, the present value of estimated unrecoverable costs, including the remaining lease obligation less estimated sublease income and the book value of abandoned property and equipment, are charged to expense. The long-term portion of the lease obligations associated with facility closings was   $217 million   and   $207 million   in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
    
  Advertising costs   - Advertising costs are expensed when the related advertising takes place. Advertising costs, net of vendor funding (included in operating expenses), were   $221 million  ,   $212 million   and   $177 million   in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
    
  Interest expense, net   - Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was   $859 million  ,   $615 million   and   $517 million  , and interest income was   $21 million  ,   $15 million   and   $8 million   in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled   $12 million  ,   $19 million   and   $25 million   in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
    
  Shares held in trust   - The Company maintains grantor trusts, which held approximately   1   million shares of its common stock at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These shares are designated for use under various employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted shares outstanding. 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive income   - Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of changes in the net actuarial gains and losses associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans, losses on derivatives from cash flow hedges executed in previous years associated with the issuance of long-term debt, and foreign currency translation adjustments.  
    40 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Company s pension and postretirement plans was   $305 million   pre-tax (  $186 million   after-tax) as of December 31, 2015 and   $234 million   pre-tax (  $143 million   after-tax) as of December 31, 2014. The net impact on cash flow hedges totaled   $14 million   pre-tax (  $7 million   after-tax) and   $16 million   pre-tax (  $9 million   after-tax) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were   $165 million   and   $65 million  , respectively. 
    
  Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component are shown below: 

(1) 
    All amounts are net of tax.  
              (2) 
    The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income for cash flow hedges are recorded within interest expense, net on the consolidated statement of income. The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income for pension and other postretirement benefits are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of income. 
       
  Stock-based compensation   - Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable requisite service period of the stock award (generally   3   to   5   years) using the straight-line method. 
    
  Variable Interest Entity   - In July 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ( Cardinal ) established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ( Red Oak ), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own   50%  . The Red Oak arrangement has an initial term of   ten years  . Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak by either company and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. 
    
  The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity because it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within the Retail/LTC Segment.  
    
  Cardinal is required to pay the Company   39   quarterly payments beginning in October 2014. As milestones are met, the quarterly payments increase. The Company received approximately   $122 million   and   $26 million   from Cardinal during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The payments reduce the Company s carrying value of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold. Revenues associated with Red Oak expenses reimbursed  
    41 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

by Cardinal for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, as well as amounts due to or due from Cardinal at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were immaterial. 
    
  Related party transactions   - The Company has an equity method investment in SureScripts, LLC ( SureScripts ), which operates a clinical health information network. The Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments utilize this clinical health information network in providing services to its client plan members and retail customers. The Company expensed fees of approximately   $50 million   in the years ended December 2015 and 2014, and   $48 million   in the year ended December 31, 2013, for the use of this network. The Company s investment in and equity in earnings of SureScripts for all periods presented is immaterial. 
    
  In connection with the acquisition of Omnicare in August 2015, the Company obtained an equity method investment in Heartland Healthcare Services ( Heartland ). Heartland operates several long-term care pharmacies in   four   states. Heartland paid the Company approximately   $25 million   for pharmaceutical inventory purchases during the period from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015. Additionally, the Company performs certain collection functions for Heartland and then passes those customer cash collections to Heartland. The Company s investment in and equity in earnings of Heartland as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 is immaterial.  
    
  In September 2014, the Company made a charitable contribution of   $25 million   to the CVS Foundation (formerly CVS Caremark Charitable Trust, Inc.) (the  Foundation ) to fund future giving. The Foundation is a non-profit entity that focuses on health, education and community involvement programs. The charitable contribution was recorded as an operating expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
    
  Income taxes   - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in the tax rates on deferred tax asset and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
    
  The Company recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized in making such a determination. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. To the extent that the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.  
    
  The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 
    
  Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. 
    
  Discontinued Operations   - In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens  n Things which filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The Company's income from discontinued operations in 2015 of   $9 million  , net of tax, was related to the release of certain store lease guarantees due to a settlement with a landlord. The Company s loss from discontinued operations includes lease-related costs which the Company believes it will likely be required to satisfy pursuant to its Linens  n Things lease guarantees. 
    
  Below is a summary of the results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31: 

42 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Earnings per common share   - Earnings per share is computed using the two-class method. Options to purchase   2.7 million  ,   2.1 million   and   6.2 million   shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the options  exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncement   - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new guidance is expected to be effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning January 1, 2018; early adoption in 2017 is permitted. Companies have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the guidance. This update could impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of this update will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adoption, as well as the method of transition and required disclosures. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   (Topic 835-30). ASU No. 2015-03 requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of such costs are required to be reported as interest expense, which is consistent with the Company s current policy. This change conforms the presentation of debt issuance costs with that of debt discounts. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015; early adoption is permitted. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods. The Company has early adopted this standard as of June 30, 2015. The effect of the adoption of ASU 2015-03 on the Company s consolidated balance sheet is a reduction of noncurrent assets and long-term debt of   $65 million   as of December 31, 2014. The following is a reconciliation of the effect of this reclassification on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014: 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  . ASU No. 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period after an acquisition within the reporting period they are determined. This is a change from the previous requirement that the adjustments be recorded retrospectively. The ASU also requires disclosure of the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the adjustment to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015; early adoption is permitted. The Company has early adopted the ASU as of September 30, 2015. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740)  . ASU No. 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. This ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively to all periods presented for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2016. The change will require additional disclosure based on the method of adoption. Had the Company adopted this ASU, current deferred income taxes, total current assets, total assets and total liabilities would have been approximately   $1.2 billion   and   $1.0 billion   lower as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
    
    2    Changes in Accounting Principle 
    
  Effective January 1, 2015, the Company changed its methods of accounting for  front store  inventories in the Retail/LTC Segment. Prior to 2015, the Company valued front store inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) basis in retail stores using the retail inventory method and in distribution centers using the FIFO cost method. Effective January 1, 2015, all front store inventories in the Retail/LTC Segment have been valued at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method. These changes affected approximately   36%   of consolidated inventories. 
    43 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

These changes were made primarily to provide the Company with better information to manage its retail front store operations and to bring all of the Company s inventories to a common inventory valuation methodology. The Company believes the weighted average cost method is preferable to the retail inventory method and the FIFO cost method because it results in greater precision in the determination of cost of revenues and inventories at the stock keeping unit ( SKU ) level and results in a consistent inventory valuation method for all of the Company s inventories as all of the Company s remaining inventories, which consist of prescription drugs, were already being valued using the weighted average cost method. 
    
  The Company recorded the cumulative effect of these changes in accounting principle as of January 1, 2015. The Company determined that retrospective application for periods prior to 2015 is impracticable, as the period-specific information necessary to value front store inventories in the Retail/LTC Segment under the weighted average cost method is unavailable. The Company implemented a new perpetual inventory system to manage front store inventory at the SKU level and valued front store inventory as of January 1, 2015 and calculated the cumulative impact. The effect of these changes in accounting principle as of January 1, 2015, was a decrease in inventories of   $7 million  , an increase in current deferred income tax assets of   $3 million   and a decrease in retained earnings of   $4 million  . 
    
  Had the Company not made these changes in accounting principle, for the year ended December 31, 2015, income from continuing operations would have been lower by   $27 million  . Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health would have been approximately   $0.02   per share lower for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
    3    Acquisitions 
    
  Omnicare Acquisition 
    
  On   August 18, 2015  , the Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding common shares and voting interests of Omnicare, for   $98   per share for a total of   $9.6 billion   and assumed long-term debt with a fair value of approximately   $3.1 billion  . Additionally, holders of Omnicare restricted stock units and performance based restricted stock units received   738,765   CVS Health Corporation restricted stock awards with a fair value of approximately   $80 million   as replacement awards. Omnicare is a leading health care services company that specializes in the management of complex pharmaceutical care. Omnicare s long-term care ( LTC ) business is the nation s largest provider of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. In addition, Omnicare has a specialty pharmacy business operating primarily under the name of Advanced Care Scripts, and provides commercialization services under the name of RxCrossroads       . The Company is including LTC and the commercialization services in its former Retail Pharmacy Segment, which has been renamed the  Retail/LTC Segment,  and will include the specialty pharmacy business in its Pharmacy Services Segment. The Company acquired Omnicare to expand its operations in dispensing prescription drugs to assisted-living and long-term care facilities, and to broaden its presence in the specialty pharmacy business as the Company seeks to serve a greater percentage of the growing senior patient population in the United States. 
    
  The fair value of the consideration transferred on the date of acquisition consisted of the following:                     (in millions) 
      
      Cash paid to Omnicare shareholders 
    $ 
    9,636 
      
      Fair value of replacement equity awards issued to Omnicare employees 
      
      for precombination services

      Total consideration 
    $ 
    9,645 

44 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: 

The assessment of fair value is preliminary and is based on information that was available to management at the time the condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared. Accordingly, such amounts may change. The most significant open items included the accounting for deferred income taxes and contingencies as management is awaiting additional information to complete its assessment of these matters. The goodwill represents future economic benefits expected to arise from the Company s expanded presence in the pharmaceutical care market, the assembled workforce acquired, expected purchasing and revenue synergies, as well as operating efficiencies and cost savings. Goodwill of   $8.6 billion   was allocated to the Retail/LTC Segment and the remaining goodwill of   $0.5 billion   was allocated to the Pharmacy Services Segment. Approximately   $0.4 billion   of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets acquired include customer relationships and trade names of   $3.9 billion   and   $74 million  , respectively, with estimated weighted average useful lives of   19.1   and   2.9   years, respectively, and   18.8   years in total. 
    
  The fair value of trade accounts receivable acquired is   $600 million  , with the gross contractual amount being   $857 million  . The Company expects   $257 million   of trade accounts receivable to be uncollectible. The fair value of other receivables acquired is   $147 million  , with the gross contractual amount being   $161 million  . The Company expects   $14 million   of other receivables to be uncollectible. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred transaction costs of   $70 million   associated with the acquisition of Omnicare that were recorded within operating expenses. 
    
  The Company s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, include   $2.6 billion   of net revenues and net income of   $61 million   associated with the operating results of Omnicare from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015. These Omnicare operating results include severance costs and accelerated stock-based compensation. 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of the Company s combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as if the Omnicare acquisition and the related financing transactions had occurred on January 1, 2014. The following pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as they would have been had the transactions been effected on the assumed date, nor is it necessarily an indication of trends in future results for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the pro forma information, basic shares outstanding and dilutive equivalents, cost savings from operating efficiencies, potential synergies, and the impact of incremental costs incurred in integrating the businesses. 

45 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Pro forma income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, excludes   $135 million   related to severance costs, accelerated stock-based compensation and transaction costs incurred in connection with the Omnicare acquisition. Pro forma income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, includes a   $521 million   loss on the early extinguishment of debt recorded by CVS Health. 
    
  Target Pharmacy Acquisition 
    
  On   December 16, 2015  , the Company acquired the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target for approximately   $1.9 billion  , plus contingent consideration of up to   $50 million   based on future prescription growth over a   three   year period. The purchase price is also subject to adjustment based on the value of inventory at the closing date. The Company acquired Target s   1,672   pharmacies which operate in   47   states and will operate them through a store-within-a-store format, branded as CVS Pharmacy. The Company also acquired   79   Target clinic locations which will be rebranded as MinuteClinic. The Company acquired the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses primarily to expand the geographic reach of its retail pharmacy business. 
    
  The estimated fair values of the assets acquired at the date of acquisition were approximately as follows: 

The assessment of fair value is preliminary and is based on information that was available to management at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Accordingly, such amounts may change. As of December 31, 2015, the most significant open item was the inventory related purchase price adjustment. Intangible assets acquired include customer relationships with an estimated useful life of   13   years. The goodwill represents future economic benefits expected to arise from the Company s expanded geographic presence in the retail pharmacy market, the assembled workforce acquired, expected purchasing and revenue synergies, as well as operating efficiencies and cost savings. The goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. No liability for any potential contingent consideration has been recorded based on current projections for future prescription growth over the relevant period.  
    
  In January 2016, the Company received approximately   $21 million   from Target as final settlement of the inventory valuation. This amount will be recorded as a reduction of the purchase price in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  In connection with the closing of the transaction, the Company and Target entered into pharmacy and clinic operating and master lease agreements. See Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of the Company s leasing arrangements. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred transaction costs of approximately   $26 million   associated with the acquisition that were recorded within operating expenses. The results of the Target pharmacies and clinics are included in the Company s Retail/LTC Segment beginning on   December 16, 2015  . Pro forma financial information for this acquisition is not presented as such results are immaterial to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Coram Acquisition 
    
  On   January 16, 2014  , the Company acquired   100%   of the voting interests of Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ), the specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition business unit of Apria Healthcare Group Inc. ( Apria ), for cash consideration of approximately   $2.1 billion  , plus contingent consideration of approximately   $0.1 billion  . The purchase price was also subject to a working capital adjustment, which resulted in the Company receiving   $9 million   from Apria. Coram is one of the nation s largest providers of comprehensive infusion services, caring for approximately   240,000   patients annually. Coram has approximately   4,600   employees, including approximately   600   nurses and   250   dietitians, operating primarily through   83   branch locations and   six   centers of excellence for patient intake.  
    
    46 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The contingent consideration is based on the Company s future realization of Coram s tax net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) as of the date of the acquisition. The Company will pay the seller the first   $60 million   in tax savings realized from the future utilization of the Coram NOLs, plus   50%   of any additional future tax savings from the remaining NOLs. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the future realization of the Coram NOLs was determined using Level 3 inputs based on the present value of contingent payments expected to be made based on the Company s estimate of the amount and timing of Coram NOLs that will ultimately be realized. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 was immaterial and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately   $4 million  . During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made contingent consideration payments to Apria of approximately   $58 million  . 
    
  The Company recognized approximately   $1.6 billion   of goodwill in connection with the acquisition. The goodwill represents future economic benefits expected to arise from the Company s expanded presence in the specialty pharmaceuticals market, the assembled workforce acquired, and the expected synergies from combining operations with Coram. The goodwill is nondeductible for income tax purposes.  
    
  Coram s results of operations are included in the Company s PSS beginning on   January 16, 2014  . Pro forma information for this acquisition is not presented as Coram s results are immaterial to the Company s consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2014, acquisition costs of   $15 million   were expensed as incurred within operating expenses. 
    
    4    Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
    
  Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. 
    
  When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company first compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and a comparable market transaction model. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of its goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company performed its required annual goodwill impairment tests. The Company concluded there were   no   goodwill impairments as of the testing date.  
    
  Below is a summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: 

(1)  Other  represents immaterial purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions. 
    
  Indefinitely-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinitely-lived trademark using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company performed its annual impairment test of the indefinitely-lived trademark and concluded there was   no   impairment as of the testing date. The carrying amount of its indefinitely-lived trademark was   $6.4 billion   as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which have a weighted average useful life of   15.5   years. The weighted average useful lives of the Company s customer contracts and relationships and covenants not to compete are   15.5   years. The weighted average lives of the Company s favorable leases and other intangible assets are   15.6   years. Amortization expense for intangible assets totaled   $611 million  ,   $518 million   and   $494 million   in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The anticipated annual amortization expense for these intangible assets for the next five years is as follows: 

The following table is a summary of the Company s intangible assets as of December 31: 

5    Share Repurchase Programs 
    
  The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2014 Repurchase Program may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. The 2013 and 2012 Repurchase Programs have been completed, as described below. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, effective December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a   $725 million   fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ). Upon payment of the   $725 million   purchase price on December 14, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR or approximately   6.2 million   shares. At the conclusion of the ASR program, the Company may receive additional shares equal to the remaining   20%   of the   $725 million   notional amount. The initial   6.2 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in December 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for   $580 million   and a forward contract for   $145 million  . The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet. On January 28, 2016, the Company received   1.4 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $725 million   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   1.4 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in January 2016 and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock. 
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2013 Repurchase Programs, effective January 2, 2015, the Company entered into a   $2.0 billion   fixed dollar ASR agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( JP Morgan ). Upon payment of the   $2.0 billion   purchase  
    48 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

price on January 5, 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   80%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately   16.8 million   shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2015. On May 1, 2015, the Company received approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock, representing the remaining   20%   of the   $2.0 billion   notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining   3.1 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by JP Morgan were placed into treasury stock in May 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for   $1.6 billion   and a forward contract for   $0.4 billion  . The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was initially recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet and was reclassified to treasury stock upon the settlement of the ASR in May 2015.  
    
  Pursuant to the authorization under the 2012 Repurchase Program, effective October 1, 2013, the Company entered into a   $1.7 billion   fixed dollar ASR agreement with Barclays. Upon payment of the   $1.7 billion   purchase price on October 1, 2013, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to   50%   of the   $1.7 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately   14.9 million   shares at a price of   $56.88   per share. The Company received approximately   11.7 million   shares of common stock on December 30, 2013 at an average price of   $63.83   per share, representing the remaining   50%   of the   $1.7 billion   notional amount of the ASR agreement and thereby concluding the agreement. The total of   26.6 million   shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays over the term of the October 2013 ASR agreement were placed into treasury stock. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction and a forward contract. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument.  
    
  Each of the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude each ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.  
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repurchased an aggregate of   48.0 million   shares of common stock for approximately   $5.0 billion   under the 2013 and 2014 Repurchase Programs. As of December 31, 2015, there remained an aggregate of approximately   $7.7 billion   available for future repurchases under the 2014 Repurchase Program and the 2013 Repurchase Program was complete. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased an aggregate of   51.4 million   shares of common stock for approximately   $4.0 billion   under the 2013 and 2012 Repurchase Programs. As of December 31, 2014, there remained an aggregate of approximately   $12.7 billion   available for future repurchases under the 2014 and 2013 Repurchase Programs. As of December 31, 2014, the 2012 Repurchase Program was complete. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company repurchased an aggregate of   66.2 million   shares of common stock for approximately   $4.0 billion   under the 2012 Repurchase Program, which includes shares received from the October 2013 ASR agreement described above. As of December 31, 2013, there remained an aggregate of approximately   $6.7 billion   available for future repurchases under the 2013 and 2012 Repurchase Programs.

6    Borrowings and Credit Agreements 
    
  The following table is a summary of the Company s borrowings as of December 31:  

The Company did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2015. In connection with its commercial paper program, the Company maintains a   $1.0 billion  ,   five  -year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on May 23, 2018, a   $1.25 billion  ,   five  -year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on July 24, 2019, and a   $1.25 billion  ,   five  -year unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on July 1, 2020. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately   0.03%  , regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2015, there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the back-up credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate for short-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was   0.36%  .

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

On May 20, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Omnicare, the Company entered into a   $13 billion   unsecured bridge loan facility. The Company paid approximately   $52 million   in fees in connection with the facility. The fees were capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility was outstanding. The bridge loan facility expired on July 20, 2015 upon the Company s issuance of unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal of   $15 billion   as discussed below. The bridge loan facility fees became fully amortized in July 2015. 
    
  On July 20, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of   $2.25 billion   of   1.9%     unsecured senior notes due 2018   ( 2018 Notes ), an aggregate of   $2.75 billion   of   2.8%     unsecured senior notes due 2020   ( 2020 Notes ), an aggregate of   $1.5 billion   of   3.5%     unsecured senior notes due 2022   ( 2022 Notes ), an aggregate of   $3 billion   of   3.875%     unsecured senior notes due 2025   ( 2025 Notes ), an aggregate of   $2 billion   of   4.875%     unsecured senior notes due 2035   ( 2035 Notes ), and an aggregate of   $3.5 billion   of   5.125%     unsecured senior notes due 2045   ( 2045 Notes  and, together with the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2035 Notes, the  Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $14.8 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The Notes pay interest semi-annually and contain redemption terms which allow or require the Company to redeem the Notes at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest at the redemption date. The net proceeds of the Notes were used to fund the Omnicare acquisition and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
    
  Upon the closing of the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015, the Company assumed the long-term debt of Omnicare that had a fair value of approximately   $3.1 billion  ,   $2.0 billion   of which was previously convertible into Omnicare shares that holders were able to redeem subsequent to the acquisition. During the period from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015, all but   $5 million   of the   $2.0 billion   of previously convertible debt was redeemed and repaid and approximately   $0.4 billion   in Omnicare term debt assumed was repaid for total repayments of Omnicare debt of approximately   $2.4 billion   in 2015.  
    
  The remaining principal of the Omnicare debt assumed was comprised of senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $700 million   (  $400 million   of   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and   $300 million   of   5% senior notes due 2024  ). In September 2015, the Company commenced exchange offers for the   4.75% senior notes due 2022   and the   5% senior notes due 2024   to exchange all validly tendered and accepted notes issued by Omnicare for notes to be issued by the Company. This offer expired on October 20, 2015 and the aggregate principal amounts below of each of the Omnicare notes were validly tendered and exchanged for notes issued by the Company. 

The Company recorded this exchange transaction as a modification of the original debt instruments. As such, no gain or loss on extinguishment was recognized in the Company's consolidated income statement as a result of this exchange transaction and issuance costs were expensed as incurred.  
    
  On August 7, 2014, the Company issued   $850 million   of   2.25%   unsecured senior notes due August 12, 2019 and   $650 million   of   3.375%   unsecured senior notes due August 12, 2024 (collectively, the  2014 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $1.5 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2014 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company s option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2014 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repay certain corporate debt. 
    
  On August 7, 2014, the Company announced tender offers for any and all of the   6.25%   Senior Notes due 2027, and up to a maximum amount of the   6.125%   Senior Notes due 2039, the   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2041 and the   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2017, for up to an aggregate principal amount of   $1.5 billion  . On August 21, 2014, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the tender offers to   $2.0 billion   and completed the repurchase for the maximum amount on September 4, 2014. The Company paid a premium of   $490 million   in excess of the debt principal in connection with the tender offers, wrote off   $26 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred   $5 million   in fees, for a total loss on the early  
    51 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

extinguishment of debt of   $521 million  . The loss was recorded in income from continuing operations on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased the remaining   $41 million   of outstanding Enhanced Capital Advantage Preferred Securities ( ECAPS ) at par. The fees and write-off of deferred issuance costs associated with the early extinguishment of the ECAPS were immaterial.   
    
  On December 2, 2013, the Company issued   $750 million   of   1.2%   unsecured senior notes due December 5, 2016;   $1.25 billion   of   2.25%   unsecured senior notes due December 5, 2018;   $1.25 billion   of   4.0%   unsecured senior notes due December 5, 2023; and   $750 million   of   5.3%   unsecured senior notes due December 5, 2043 (the  2013 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately   $4.0 billion  , net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2013 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company s option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2013 Notes were used to repay commercial paper outstanding at the time of issuance and to fund the acquisition of Coram in January 2014. The remainder was used for general corporate purposes. 
    
  The credit facilities, back-up credit facilities and unsecured senior notes contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. The covenants do not materially affect the Company s financial or operating flexibility. 
    
  The following is a summary of the Company's required principal debt repayments, excluding unamortized debt discounts, deferred financing costs and debt premiums, due during each of the next five years and thereafter, as of December 31, 2015:  

7    Leases 
    
  The Company leases most of its retail and mail order locations,   ten   of its distribution centers and certain corporate offices under noncancelable operating leases, typically with initial terms of   15   to   25   years and with options that permit renewals for additional periods. The Company also leases certain equipment and other assets under noncancelable operating leases, typically with initial terms of   3   to   10   years. In December 2015, in connection with the acquisition of the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target, the Company entered into lease agreements with Target for the pharmacy and clinic space within Target stores. Given that the noncancelable contractual term of the pharmacy lease arrangement exceeds the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings being leased, the Company concluded for accounting purposes that the lease term was the remaining economic life of the buildings. Consequently, most of the individual pharmacy leases are capital leases. Approximately   $0.3 billion   of capital lease obligations were recorded in connection with this transaction. 
    
  Minimum rent on operating leases is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition to minimum rental payments, certain leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed when incurred. 
    
  The following table is a summary of the Company s net rental expense for operating leases for the years ended December 31:   

52 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table is a summary of the future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases as of December 31, 2015:  

(1) 
    Future operating lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of   $180 million   due in the future under noncancelable subleases. 
              (2) 
    The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target. Amounts related to such capital and operating leases are reflected above. Amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings of approximately   $1.7 billion   are not reflected herein since the estimated economic life of the buildings is shorter than the contractual term of the lease arrangement. 
       
  The Company finances a portion of its store development program through sale-leaseback transactions. The properties are generally sold at net book value, which generally approximates fair value, and the resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. The operating leases that resulted from these transactions are included in the above table. The Company does not have any retained or contingent interests in the stores and does not provide any guarantees, other than a guarantee of lease payments, in connection with the sale-leaseback transactions. Proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions totaled   $411 million   in 2015,   $515 million   in 2014 and   $600 million   in 2013. 
    
    8    Medicare Part D 
    
  The Company offers Medicare Part D benefits through SilverScript, which has contracted with CMS to be a PDP and, pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, must be a risk-bearing entity regulated under state insurance laws or similar statutes. 
    
  SilverScript is a licensed domestic insurance company under the applicable laws and regulations. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, SilverScript must file quarterly and annual reports with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) and certain state regulators, must maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus under a formula established by the NAIC and must, in certain circumstances, request and receive the approval of certain state regulators before making dividend payments or other capital distributions to the Company. The Company does not believe these limitations on dividends and distributions materially impact its financial position. 
    
  The Company has recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from its participation in the Medicare Part D program based on information in its claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from its participation in this program include: (i) estimates of low-income cost subsidy, reinsurance amounts, and coverage gap discount amounts ultimately payable to or receivable from CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation that will occur in the following year; (ii) an estimate of amounts receivable from or payable to CMS under a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor and (iii) estimates for claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported.  
    
  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, amounts due from CMS included in accounts receivable were   $1.6 billion   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively. 
    
    9    Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits 
    
  Defined Contribution Plans 
    
  The Company sponsors voluntary 401(k) savings plans that cover all employees who meet plan eligibility requirements. The Company makes matching contributions consistent with the provisions of the plans. 
    53 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

At the participant s option, account balances, including the Company s matching contribution, can be transferred without restriction among various investment options, including the Company s common stock fund under one of the defined contribution plans. The Company also maintains a nonqualified, unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for certain key employees. This plan provides participants the opportunity to defer portions of their eligible compensation and receive matching contributions equivalent to what they could have received under the CVS Health 401(k) Plan absent certain restrictions and limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company s contributions under the above defined contribution plans were   $251 million  ,   $238 million   and   $235 million   in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
    
  Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company sponsored   seven   defined benefit pension plans.   Two   of the plans are tax-qualified plans that are funded based on actuarial calculations and applicable federal laws and regulations. The other   five   plans are unfunded nonqualified supplemental retirement plans. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company sponsored   nine   defined benefit pension plans.   Four   of the plans were tax-qualified plans and the other   five   plans were unfunded nonqualified supplemental retirement plans. Most of the plans were frozen in prior periods.  
    
  On September 30, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved a resolution to merge the   four   tax-qualified defined benefit plans that existed in 2014 and terminate the resulting merged plan. The merger was effective September 30, 2015 and the merged plan termination was effective December 31, 2015. It is expected to take approximately   18   to   24   months to complete the settlement of the terminated plan from the date of the approved resolution. The assumptions used to calculate the pension liability as of December 31, 2015 reflect the resolution to terminate the merged plan. This resulted in the pension liability and pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive income both increasing by   $67 million   during the three months ended December 31, 2015. The pension liability will be settled in either lump sum payments or purchased annuities. Currently, there is not enough information available to determine the ultimate cost of the termination; however, based on current market rates the one-time settlement charge at final liquidation is estimated to be in the range of approximately   $175 million   to   $250 million  . 
    
  The following tables outline the change in benefit obligations and plan assets over the comparable periods: 

54 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The components of net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are shown below:  

Pension Plan Assumptions 
    
  The Company uses a series of actuarial assumptions to determine the benefit obligations and the net benefit costs. The discount rate is determined by examining the current yields observed on the measurement date of fixed-interest, high quality investments expected to be available during the period to maturity of the related benefits on a plan by plan basis. The discount rate for the merged qualified plan that has been terminated is determined by examining the current assumed lump sum and annuity purchase rates. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the plan s target allocation and historical returns for each asset class on a plan by plan basis. Certain of the Company s pension plans use assumptions on expected compensation increases of plan participants. These increases are determined by an actuarial analysis of the plan participants, their expected compensation increases, and the duration of their earnings period until retirement. Each of these assumptions are reviewed as plan characteristics change and on an annual basis with input from senior pension and financial executives and the Company s external actuarial consultants.  
    
  The discount rate for determining plan benefit obligations was   4.25%   for all plans except the merged qualified plan in 2015 and   4%   for all plans in 2014. The discount rate for the merged qualified plan was   3.25%   in 2015. The expected long-term rate of return for the plans ranged from   5.75%   to   6.75%   in 2015 and ranged from   5.75%   to   7.25%   in 2014. The rate of compensation increases for certain of the plans with active participants ranged from   4%   to   6%   in 2015 and 2014. 
    
  Return on Plan Assets 
    
  Historically, the Company used an investment strategy which emphasized equities in order to produce higher expected returns, and in the long run, lower expected expense and cash contribution requirements. Beginning in 2013, the Company changed its investment strategy to be liability management driven. The qualified pension plan asset allocation targets in 2014 and 2013 were revised to hold more fixed income investments based on the change in the investment strategy. As of December 31, 2015, investment allocations for the two qualified defined benefit plans range from   80%   to   100%   in fixed income and   0%   to   20%   in equities. The following tables show the fair value allocation of plan assets by asset category as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company s qualified defined benefit pension plan assets consisted of   19%   equity,   80%   fixed income and   2%   money market securities of which   21%   were classified as Level 1 and   79%   as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company s qualified defined benefit pension plan assets as of December 31, 2014 consisted of   18%   equity,   81%   fixed income and   1%   money market securities of which   14%   were classified as Level 1 and   86%   as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The Company continued to have no investments in Level 3 alternative investments during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The Company contributed   $22 million  ,   $42 million   and   $33 million   to the pension plans during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company plans to make approximately   $37 million   in contributions to the pension plans during 2016. These contributions include contributions made to certain nonqualified benefit plans for which there is no funding requirement. The Company estimates the following future benefit payments which are calculated using the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015: 

(1) Excludes any payments associated with the ultimate settlement of the terminated plan discussed above. 
    
  Multiemployer Pension Plans 
    
  The Company also contributes to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following aspects: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. 
    
  None of the multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates are individually significant to the Company. Total Company contributions to multiemployer pension plans were   $14 million   in 2015 and 2014 and   $13 million   in 2013. 
    
  Other Postretirement Benefits 
    
  The Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees who meet eligibility requirements. The Company s funding policy is generally to pay covered expenses as they are incurred. For retiree medical plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company s other postretirement benefits have an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of   $33 million   and   $31 million  , respectively. Net periodic benefit costs related to these other postretirement benefits were   $2 million   in 2015,   $1 million   in 2014, and   $11 million   in 2013. The net periodic benefit costs for 2013 include a settlement loss of   $8 million  . 
    
  Pursuant to various collective bargaining agreements, the Company also contributes to multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover certain union-represented employees. The plans provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain employees who meet eligibility requirements. Total Company contributions to multiemployer health and welfare plans were   $60 million  ,   $58 million   and   $55 million   in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

10    Stock Incentive Plans 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the stock award (generally   three   to   five   years) using the straight-line method.  
    
  Compensation expense related to stock options, which includes the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) totaled   $90 million  ,   $103 million   and   $100 million   for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The recognized tax benefit was   $26 million  ,   $33 million   and   $32 million   for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Compensation expense related to restricted stock awards totaled   $140 million  ,   $62 million   and   $41 million   for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31,2015 includes   $38 million   associated with accelerated vesting of restricted stock replacement awards issued to Omnicare executives who were terminated subsequent to the acquisition. 
    
  The ESPP provides for the purchase of up to   15 million   shares of common stock. In March 2013, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the ESPP to provide an additional   15 million   shares of common stock for issuance. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase common stock at the end of each six month offering period at a purchase price equal to   85%   of the lower of the fair market value on the first day or the last day of the offering period. During 2015, approximately   1 million   shares of common stock were purchased under the provisions of the ESPP at an average price of   $72.21   per share. As of December 31, 2015, approximately   14 million   shares of common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP. 
    
  The fair value of stock-based compensation associated with the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant (the first day of the six month offering period) using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. 
    
  The following table is a summary of the assumptions used to value the ESPP awards for each of the respective periods:  

(1) 
    The dividend yield is calculated based on semi-annual dividends paid and the fair market value of the Company s stock at the grant date. 
              (2) 
    The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s daily stock market prices over the previous six month period. 
              (3) 
    The risk-free interest rate is based on the Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected term of ESPP options (i.e.,   6   months). 
              (4) 
    The expected life is based on the semi-annual purchase period. 
       
  The terms of the Company s Incentive Compensation Plan ( ICP ) provide for grants of annual incentive and long-term performance awards to executive officers and other officers and employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company. Payment of such annual incentive and long-term performance awards will be in cash, stock, other awards or other property, at the discretion of the Management Planning and Development Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. The ICP allows for a maximum of   74 million   shares to be reserved and available for grants. The ICP is the only compensation plan under which the Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to its employees, with the exception of the Company s ESPP. In November 2012, the Company s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the ICP to eliminate the share recycling provision of the ICP. As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately   24 million   shares available for future grants under the ICP. 
    
  The Company s restricted awards are considered nonvested share awards and require no payment from the employee. Compensation cost is recorded based on the market price of the Company s common stock on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company granted   2,695,000  ,   2,708,000   and   1,715,000   restricted stock units with a weighted average fair value of   $100.81  ,   $73.60   and   $54.30   in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, there was   $268 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock units that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.61   years. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was   $164 million  ,   $57 million   and   $41 million  , respectively. 
    
    57 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table is a summary of the restricted stock unit and restricted share award activity for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

All grants under the ICP are awarded at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock options granted generally become exercisable over a   four  -year period from the grant date. Stock options generally expire   seven years   after the grant date. 
    
  Excess tax benefits of   $127 million  ,   $106 million   and   $62 million   were included in financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flow during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised, which includes the ESPP, totaled   $299 million  ,   $421 million   and   $500 million   during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was   $394 million  ,   $372 million   and   $282 million   in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was   $334 million  ,   $292 million   and   $329 million  , respectively. 
    
  The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions at the time of grant:  

(1) 
    The dividend yield is based on annual dividends paid and the fair market value of the Company s stock at the grant date. 
              (2) 
    The expected volatility is estimated using the Company s historical volatility over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant after adjustments for infrequent events such as stock splits. 
              (3) 
    The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options being valued. 
              (4) 
    The expected life represents the number of years the options are expected to be outstanding from grant date based on historical option holder exercise experience. 
       
  As of December 31, 2015, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options totaled   $91 million  , which the Company expects to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.72   years. After considering anticipated forfeitures, the Company expects approximately   12 million   of the unvested stock options to vest over the requisite service period.

11    Income Taxes 
    
  The income tax provision for continuing operations consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: 

The following table is a reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the Company s effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table is a summary of the significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31: 

Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows: 

The Company assesses positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not some portion of a deferred tax asset would not be realized. When it would not, a valuation allowance is established for such portion of a deferred tax asset. The Company's valuation allowance increased by   $110 million   in the current year, a majority of which relates to capital losses assumed in the Omnicare acquisition. 
    
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

The Company and most of its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of numerous state and local jurisdictions. The Company is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process ( CAP ), which is a voluntary program offered by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) under which participating taxpayers work collaboratively with the IRS to identify and resolve potential tax issues through open, cooperative and transparent interaction prior to the filing of their federal income tax. The IRS is currently examining the Company s 2014 and 2015 consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. 
    
    60 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The Company and its subsidiaries are also currently under income tax examinations by a number of state and local tax authorities. As of December 31, 2015, no examination has resulted in any proposed adjustments that would result in a material change to the Company s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  
    
  Substantially all material state and local income tax matters have been concluded for fiscal years through 2010. Although certain state exams will be concluded and certain state statutes will lapse in 2016, the change in the balance of our uncertain tax positions will be immaterial. In addition, it is reasonably possible that the Company s unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months due to the anticipated conclusion of various examinations with the IRS for various years. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time. 
    
  The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense. The Company recognized interest of approximately   $5 million   during the year ended December 31, 2015,   $6 million   during the year ended December 31, 2014, and   $4 million   during the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company had approximately   $16 million   and   $11 million   accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
    
  There are no material uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 the ultimate deductibility of which is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing. If there were, any such items would impact deferred tax accounting only, not the annual effective income tax rate, and would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to a period earlier than expected. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is approximately   $292 million  , after considering the federal benefit of state income taxes. 
    
    12    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Lease Guarantees 
    
  Between 1991 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob s Stores, Linens  n Things, Marshalls, Kay-Bee Toys, Wilsons, This End Up and Footstar. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the store s lease obligations. When the subsidiaries were disposed of, the Company s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser has agreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries were to become insolvent and failed to make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy these obligations. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company guaranteed approximately   72   such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens  n Things, which are discussed in Note 1), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2026. Management believes the ultimate disposition of any of the remaining guarantees will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or future cash flows. 
    
  Legal Matters 
    
  The Company is a party to legal proceedings, investigations and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including the matters described below. The Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability. None of the Company s accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company s financial position. 
    
  The Company s contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties, including, among other factors: (i) the procedural status of pending matters; (ii) whether class action status is sought and certified; (iii) whether asserted claims or allegations will survive dispositive motion practice; (iv) the extent of potential damages, fines or penalties, which are often unspecified or indeterminate; (v) the impact of discovery on the legal process; (vi) whether novel or unsettled legal theories are at issue; (vii) the settlement posture of the parties, and/or (viii) in the case of certain government agency investigations, whether a sealed   qui tam   lawsuit ( whistleblower  action) has been filed and whether the government agency makes a decision to intervene in the lawsuit following investigation. 
    
    61 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Except as otherwise noted, the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, and is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for these matters. 

Caremark (the term  Caremark  being used herein to generally refer to any one or more PBM subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable) was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed in October 2003 in Alabama state court by John Lauriello, purportedly on behalf of participants in the 1999 settlement of various securities class action and derivative lawsuits against Caremark and others. Other defendants include insurance companies that provided coverage to Caremark with respect to the settled lawsuits. The Lauriello lawsuit seeks approximately   $3.2 billion   in compensatory damages plus other non-specified damages based on allegations that the amount of insurance coverage available for the settled lawsuits was misrepresented and suppressed. A similar lawsuit was filed in November 2003 by Frank McArthur, also in Alabama state court, naming as defendants, among others, Caremark and several insurance companies involved in the 1999 settlement. This lawsuit was stayed as a later-filed class action, but McArthur was subsequently allowed to intervene in the Lauriello action. Following the close of class discovery, the trial court entered an Order on August 15, 2012 that granted the plaintiffs  motion to certify a class pursuant to Alabama Rule of Civil Procedures 23(b)(3) but denied their request that the class also be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(1). In addition, the August 15, 2012 Order appointed class representatives and class counsel. On September 12, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the trial court s August 15, 2012 Order. In November 2015, the trial court ruled on the parties  motions for summary judgment. The Court granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and the Court denied Caremark's motion for summary judgment. The parties engaged in mediation in January 2016. The case is proceeding and trial is currently scheduled to begin on February 19, 2016. 

Beginning in August 2003, various lawsuits were filed by pharmacies alleging that Caremark and other PBMs were violating certain antitrust laws. In August 2003, Bellevue Drug Co., Robert Schreiber, Inc. d/b/a Burns Pharmacy and Rehn-Huerbinger Drug Co. d/b/a Parkway Drugs #4, together with Pharmacy Freedom Fund and the National Community Pharmacists Association filed a putative class action against Caremark in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking treble damages and injunctive relief. This case was initially sent to arbitration based on the contract terms between the pharmacies and Caremark, but later returned to federal court, where it currently remains. In addition, in October 2003,   two   independent pharmacies, North Jackson Pharmacy, Inc. and C C, Inc. d/b/a Big C Discount Drugs, Inc., filed   three   separate putative class action complaints in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, all seeking treble damages and injunctive relief.   One   complaint named   three   Caremark entities as defendants, and the other   two   complaints named PBM competitors. The North Jackson Pharmacy case against   two   of the Caremark entities was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois; the case against the third Caremark entity was sent to arbitration based on contract terms between the pharmacies and that entity. The arbitration was stayed at the parties  request and later closed by the American Arbitration Association. 
       
  In August 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring all related PBM antitrust cases, including the North Jackson Pharmacy cases, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated and consolidated proceedings with the cases originally filed in that court, including the Bellevue matter. The consolidated action is now known as   In re Pharmacy Benefit Managers Antitrust Litigation  . A motion for class certification filed by the North Jackson Pharmacy plaintiffs against the Caremark defendants in August 2015 is currently pending. In the Bellevue matter, the parties are in the early stages of discovery.  

In February 2006,   two   substantially similar putative class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, and were consolidated and entitled Indiana State Dist. Council of Laborers   HOD Carriers Pension   Welfare Fund v. Omnicare, Inc.,   et al.  , No. 2:06cv26. The consolidated complaint was filed against Omnicare,   three   of its officers and   two   of its directors and purported to be brought on behalf of all open-market purchasers of Omnicare common stock from August 3, 2005 through July 27, 2006, as well as all purchasers who bought shares of Omnicare common stock in Omnicare s public offering in December 2005. The complaint alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and sought, among other things, compensatory damages and injunctive relief. After dismissals and appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the United States Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court. In October 2015, the court granted plaintiffs  motion to file a third amended complaint. In December 2015, Omnicare filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' third amended complaint. 

In December 2007, the Company received a document subpoena from the Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requesting information relating to the processing of Medicaid and certain other government agency claims on behalf of its clients (which allegedly resulted in underpayments from our  
       62 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

pharmacy benefit management clients to the applicable government agencies) on   one   of the Company s adjudication platforms. In September 2014, the Company settled the OIG s claims, as well as related claims by the Department of Justice and private plaintiffs, without any admission of liability. The Company is in discussions with the OIG concerning other claim processing issues. 

In November 2009, a securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island by Richard Medoff, purportedly on behalf of purchasers of CVS Health Corporation stock between May 5, 2009 and November 4, 2009. An amended complaint extended that time period back to October 30, 2008. The lawsuit names the Company and certain officers as defendants and includes allegations of securities fraud relating to public disclosures made by the Company concerning the PBM business and allegations of insider trading. In addition, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed by Mark Wuotila in December 2009 in the same court against the directors and certain officers of the Company. This lawsuit, which has remained stayed pending developments in the related securities class action, includes allegations of, among other things, securities fraud, insider trading and breach of fiduciary duties and further alleges that the Company was damaged by the purchase of stock at allegedly inflated prices under its share repurchase program. In January 2011, both lawsuits were transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. In August 2015, the Parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the Medoff action for   $48 million  . In September 2015, the Parties filed a joint stipulation seeking preliminary approval for this settlement. Preliminary approval was granted in November 2015 and the final approval hearing occurred in January 2016. The Company denies any wrongdoing, and agreed to a settlement to avoid the burden, uncertainty and distraction of litigation. The settlement will be funded by insurance proceeds. The Wuotila derivative matter remains pending. 

As part of a previously disclosed civil settlement agreement entered into by Omnicare with the U.S. Attorney s Office, for the District of Massachusetts in November 2009, Omnicare also entered into an amended and restated corporate integrity agreement ( CIA ) with the OIG with a term of   five years   from November 2, 2009 with certain provisions continuing for a period after the term. In October 2015, Omnicare received a closure letter from the OIG. The Company is continuing discussions with the OIG around the CIA and its compliance program. 

In March 2010, the Company learned that various State Attorneys General offices and certain other government agencies were conducting a multi-state investigation of certain of the Company s business practices similar to those being investigated at that time by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ).   Twenty-eight   states, the District of Columbia and the County of Los Angeles are known to be participating in this investigation. The prior FTC investigation, which commenced in August 2009, was officially concluded in May 2012 when the consent order entered into between the FTC and the Company became final. The Company has cooperated with the multi-state investigation. 

In March 2010, the Company received a subpoena from the OIG requesting information about programs under which the Company has offered customers remuneration conditioned upon the transfer of prescriptions for drugs or medications to the Company s pharmacies in the form of gift cards, cash, non-prescription merchandise or discounts or coupons for non-prescription merchandise. The subpoena relates to an investigation of possible false or otherwise improper claims for payment under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company has provided documents and other information in response to this request for information. 

On October 29, 2010, a   qui tam   complaint entitled United States   et al., ex rel.   Banigan and Templin v. Organon USA, Inc., Omnicare, Inc. and PharMerica Corporation, Civil No. 07-12153-RWZ, that had been filed under seal with the U.S. District Court in Boston, Massachusetts, was ordered unsealed by the court. The complaint was brought by James Banigan and Richard Templin, former employees of Organon, as private party   qui tam   relators on behalf of the federal government and several state and local governments. The action alleges civil violations of the False Claims Act based on allegations that Organon and its affiliates paid Omnicare and several other long-term care pharmacies rebates, post-purchase discounts and other forms of remuneration in return for purchasing pharmaceuticals from Organon and taking steps to increase the purchase of Organon s drugs in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to intervene in this action. The court denied Omnicare s motion to dismiss in June 2012. Discovery is closed in this matter. The Company believes that the allegations are without merit. 

In January 2012, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania unsealed a first amended   qui tam   complaint filed in August 2011 by an individual relator, Anthony Spay, who is described in the complaint as having once been employed by a firm providing pharmacy prescription benefit audit and recovery services. The complaint seeks monetary damages and alleges that Caremark s processing of Medicare claims on behalf of one of its clients violated the federal False Claims Act. The United States declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In September  
       63 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

2015, the Court granted Caremark's motion for summary judgment in its entirety, and entered judgment in favor of Caremark and against Spay. In October 2015, Spay filed a notice of appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 

In November 2012, the Company received a subpoena from the OIG requesting information concerning automatic refill programs used by pharmacies to refill prescriptions for customers. The Company has been cooperating and providing documents and other information in response to this request for information. 

In 2013, Omnicare received subpoenas seeking information regarding Omnicare s nationwide billing practices with regard to National Drug Code overrides and Omnicare s May 2008 acquisition of Pure Service Pharmacy. In 2014, Omnicare received subpoenas seeking information regarding Omnicare s Auto Label Verification system and Omnicare s per diem arrangements. Omnicare has produced documents and provided information in response to these subpoenas and continues to cooperate in the investigations. 

On March 22, 2013, a   qui tam   complaint entitled United States   et al. ex rel.   Susan Ruscher v. Omnicare, Inc.   et al.  , Civil No. 08-cv-3396, which had been filed under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, was unsealed by the court. The complaint was brought by Susan Ruscher as a private party   qui tam   relator on behalf of the federal government and several state governments alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and analogous state laws based upon allegations that Omnicare s practices relating to customer collections violated the Anti-Kickback Statute. In September 2015, the court granted summary judgment dismissing all claims against Omnicare and denied relator s motion for summary judgment related to Omnicare s counterclaims and thereafter, in October 2015, the court entered a final judgment for Omnicare and stayed trial on the counterclaims pending an appeal from the relator. In October 2015, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 

In March 2014, the Company received a subpoena from the United States Attorney s Office for the     District of Rhode Island, requesting documents and information concerning bona fide service fees and rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in connection with certain drugs utilized under Part D of the Medicare Program, as well as the reporting of those fees and rebates to Part D plan sponsors. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the subpoena. 

The U.S. Department of Justice, through the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of Virginia, investigated whether Omnicare s activities in connection with the agreements it had with the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical Depakote violated the False Claims Act or the Anti-Kickback Statute. Omnicare cooperated with this investigation and believes that it has complied with applicable laws and regulations with respect to this matter. In connection with this matter, on December 22, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil complaint-in-intervention in   two     qui tam   complaints, entitled United States,   et al., ex rel.   Spetter v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., Omnicare, Inc., and PharMerica Corp., No. 1:07-cv-00006 and United States,   et al., ex rel.   McCoyd v. Abbott Laboratories, Omnicare, Inc., PharMerica Corp., and Miles White, No. 1:07-cv-00081, alleging civil violations of the False Claims Act in connection with the manufacturer agreements described above. In July 2015, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Stay the Litigation stating that the parties have reached a proposed resolution of the monetary terms of a potential settlement agreement. These financial terms are contingent on approval by authorized officials at the Department of Justice, negotiation of terms of a settlement agreement, approval and releases from the OIG, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and the Department of Justice, and coordination with discussions with the United States regarding other ongoing matters. While the Company believes that a final settlement will be reached, there can be no assurance that any final settlement agreement will be reached or as to the final terms of such settlement.  

In May 2015, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Middle District of Florida, resolving alleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ). The Company paid a fine of   $22 million   in connection with the settlement. The Company is also undergoing several audits by the Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) Administrator and is in discussions with the DEA and the U.S. Attorney s Office in several locations concerning allegations that the Company has violated certain requirements of the CSA. Whether agreements can be reached and on what terms is uncertain.  

In May 2015, the Company received a subpoena from the OIG requesting information and documents concerning the Company s automatic refill programs, adherence outreach programs, and pharmacy customer incentives, particularly in connection with claims for reimbursement made to the Minnesota Medicaid program. The Company has been cooperating with the investigation and providing information in response to the subpoena.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

In July 2015, the U.S. District Court in the District of Massachusetts dismissed all claims alleged in a   qui tam   lawsuit that had been brought against the Company by a pharmacy auditor and a former CVS pharmacist. The lawsuit, which was initially filed under seal in 2011, alleged that the Company violated the federal False Claims Act, as well as the false claims acts of several states, by overcharging state and federal governments in connection with prescription drugs available through the Company s Health Savings Pass program, a membership-based program that allows enrolled customers special pricing for typical   90  -day supplies of various generic prescription drugs. The federal government had declined to intervene in the case. The plaintiffs are appealing the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for First Circuit. 

On July 27, 2015, a consolidated class action complaint was filed by plaintiffs naming Omnicare, the members of the Omnicare Board of Directors, CVS Health, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. and its merger subsidiary as defendants. The complaint alleged that the members of the Omnicare Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties to Omnicare s stockholders during merger negotiations by entering into the merger agreement and approving the merger, and the CVS parties aided and abetted such breaches of fiduciary duties. In September 2015, the court granted plaintiffs  voluntary notice of dismissal of all allegations against the defendants. 

The Attorney General of the State of Texas issued civil investigative demands and other requests in February 2012, May 2014, and May 2015, and has continued its investigation concerning the Health Savings Pass program and other pricing practices with respect to claims for reimbursement from the Texas Medicaid program. 

In July and September 2015,   two   related putative class actions, Corcoran   et al  . v. CVS Health Corp., and   Podgorny   et al  . v. CVS Health Corp., were filed against the Company in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California and the Northern District of Illinois, respectively. The two cases have been consolidated in United States District Court in the Northern District of California.  The consolidated second amended complaint alleges that plaintiffs overpaid for prescriptions for generic drugs filled at CVS pharmacies. The plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief under the consumer protection statutes and common laws of certain states. The Company has moved to dismiss the second amended complaint.     

In September 2015, Omnicare was served with an administrative subpoena by the DEA. The subpoena seeks documents related to controlled substance policies, procedures, and practices at   eight   pharmacy locations from May 2012 to present. The Company has been cooperating and providing documents in response to this administrative subpoena. 

In October 2015, Omnicare received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting information and documents concerning Omnicare s cycle fill process for assisted living facilities. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand. 

In October 2015, the Company received from the U.S. Department of Justice a Civil Investigative Demand requesting documents and information in connection with a False Claims Act investigation concerning allegations that the Company submitted, or caused to be submitted, to the Medicare Part D program prescription drug event data that misrepresented true prices paid by the Company's PBM to pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company s PBM.  The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand. 

In November 2015, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania unsealed a second amended   qui tam   complaint filed in September 2015, in an action captioned The United States of America et al.   ex rel.   Sally Schimelpfeinig and John Segura v. Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Limited   et al  . The U.S. Department of Justice declined to intervene in this action. The relators allege that the Company, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, and Dr. Reddy s Laboratories violated the federal and various state False Claims Acts by dispensing prescriptions in unit dose packaging supplied by Dr. Reddy s that was not compliant with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act and the Poison Preventive Packaging Act and thereby allegedly rendering the drugs misbranded under the Food, Drug   Cosmetic Act. 
       
  The Company is also a party to other legal proceedings, government investigations, inquiries and audits arising in the normal course of its business, none of which is expected to be material to the Company. The Company can give no assurance, however, that its business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected, or that the Company will not be required to materially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations as they may relate to the Company s  
    65

business, the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industries or to the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of the Company s business or the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally; (iv) pending or future government enforcement actions against the Company; (v) adverse developments in any pending   qui tam   lawsuit against the Company, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future   qui tam   lawsuit that may be filed against the Company; or (vi) adverse developments in pending or future legal proceedings against the Company or affecting the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally. 
    
    13    Segment Reporting 
    
  The Company currently has   three   reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. The Retail/LTC Segment includes the operating results of the Company's Retail Pharmacy and LTC operating segments as the operations and economics characteristics are similar. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information for which operating results are evaluated on a regular basis by the Company's chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 
    
  The Company evaluates its Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segment performance based on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of nonrecurring charges and certain intersegment activities. The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate Segment based on operating expenses before the effect of discontinued operations, nonrecurring charges, and certain intersegment activities. See Note 1 for a description of the Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate segments and related significant accounting policies. 
    
  The following table is a reconciliation of the Company s business segments to the consolidated financial statements:  

(1) 
    Net revenues of the Pharmacy Services Segment include approximately   $8.9 billion  ,   $8.1 billion   and   $7.9 billion   of Retail Co-Payments for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Retail Co-Payments.  
              (2) 
    Intersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services Segment and the Retail/LTC Segment. These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients ( members ) fill prescriptions at retail stores to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice        elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at a retail drugstore instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at long-term care facilities. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis. 
              (3) 
    For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Corporate Segment operating loss includes   $156 million   of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs and a   $90 million   charge related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 legal settlement by MedPartners of various securities class actions and a related derivative claim. 
              (4) 
    Consolidated operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes a   $72 million   gain on a legal settlement, of which,   $11 million   is included in the Pharmacy Services Segment and   $61 million   is included in the Retail/LTC Segment.

      Five-Year Financial Summary

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of CVS Health Corporation 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CVS Health Corporation at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected changes its methods of accounting for front store inventories in the Retail/LTC Segment effective January 1, 2015. 
    
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), CVS Health Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated     Framework     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 9, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
