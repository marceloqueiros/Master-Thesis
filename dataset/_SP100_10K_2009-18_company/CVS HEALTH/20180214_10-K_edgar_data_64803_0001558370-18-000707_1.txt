PART I   

Item 1. Business   

Overview 

CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively,  CVS Health,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ), is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health. At the forefront of a changing health care landscape, the Company has an unmatched suite of capabilities and the expertise needed to drive innovations that will help shape the future of health care. 

We are currently the only integrated pharmacy health care company with the ability to impact consumers, payors, and providers with innovative, channel-agnostic solutions. We have a deep understanding of their diverse needs through our unique integrated model, and we are bringing them innovative solutions that help increase access to quality care, deliver better health outcomes and lower overall health care costs. 

Through more than 9,800 retail locations, more than 1,100 walk-in health care clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with more than 94 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year, expanding specialty pharmacy services and a leading stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, we enable people, businesses, and communities to manage health in more affordable, effective ways. We are delivering break-through products and services, from advising patients on their medications at our CVS Pharmacy       locations, to introducing unique programs to help control costs for our clients at CVS Caremark     , to innovating how care is delivered to our patients with complex conditions through CVS Specialty     , to improving pharmacy care for the senior community through Omnicare     , or by expanding access to high-quality, low-cost care at CVS MinuteClinic     . 

We have three reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. 

Proposed Acquisition of Aetna 

On December 3, 2017, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Aetna Inc. ( Aetna ) for a combination of cash and stock (the  Aetna Acquisition ). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Aetna shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. The transaction values Aetna at approximately $207 per share or approximately $69 billion based on the Company s 5-day volume weighted average price ending December 1, 2017 of $74.21 per share. Including the assumption of Aetna s debt, the total value of the transaction is approximately $77 billion. The final purchase price will be determined based on the Company s stock price on the date of closing of the transaction. 

The proposed acquisition is currently projected to close in the second half of 2018 and remains subject to approval by CVS Health and Aetna shareholders and customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the waiting period under the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ( HSR Act ) and approvals of state departments of insurance and U.S. and international regulators. 

Pharmacy Services Segment 

The Pharmacy Services Segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) solutions, as described more fully below, to clients consisting primarily of employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part D plans, Managed Medicaid plans, plans offered on the public and private exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. In addition, through our SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. The Pharmacy Services Segment operates under the CVS Caremark Pharmacy Services, Caremark     , CVS Specialty     , AccordantCare  TM  , SilverScript     , Wellpartner     , NovoLogix     , Coram     , Navarro      Health Services and ACS Pharmacy names. As of December 31, 2017, the Pharmacy Services Segment operated 23 retail specialty pharmacy stores, 18 specialty mail order pharmacies and four mail order dispensing pharmacies, and 83 branches for infusion and enteral services, including approximately 73 ambulatory infusion suites and three centers of excellence, located in 42 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our PBM filled or managed approximately 1.8 billion prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis.

Pharmacy Services Business Strategy   - Our pharmacy services business strategy centers on providing innovative tools and strategies, as well as quality client service, in order to help improve clinical outcomes for our clients  plan members while assisting them with better managing pharmacy and overall health care costs. Our goal is to produce superior results for our clients and their plan members by leveraging our expertise in core PBM services, including: plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. 

In addition, as a fully integrated pharmacy services company that helps clients improve quality and lower their pharmacy costs, we offer our clients and their plan members a variety of programs and tools, including plan design offerings, that benefit from our integrated systems and the ability of our almost 36,000 pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants to interact personally with the many plan members we serve. Through our multiple member touch points (retail stores, mail order, infusion, long-term care and specialty pharmacies, retail clinics, digital resources and cost management tools), we seek to engage plan members in behaviors that help lower cost and improve health care outcomes. Examples of these programs and services include: Maintenance Choice     , a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions through delivery to their home or business or at our CVS Pharmacy retail stores for the same price as mail order; Pharmacy Advisor     , a program that facilitates face-to-face and telephone counseling by our pharmacists to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions; enhanced disease management programs, such as our TransformCare  TM   offerings, that are targeted at managing chronic disease states; Specialty Connect     , our specialty pharmacy offering that integrates specialty mail and retail capabilities, providing members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the convenience of picking up their prescriptions at their local CVS Pharmacy or having them delivered to their home or office and an ExtraCare      Health Card program that offers discounts to eligible plan members on certain over-the-counter health care products sold in our CVS Pharmacy stores. In addition, CVS MinuteClinic ( MinuteClinic ) is an important and differentiated part of the enterprise that offers certain capabilities to PBM clients and their members. For example, we offer plan-sponsored co-pay reductions to encourage use of MinuteClinic, thereby helping to reduce emergency room visits and to lower overall health care costs. We also partner with our health plan clients sponsoring patient-centered medical homes, biometric screenings for plan members, closing gaps in care, and onsite clinics at client corporate headquarters. 

PBM Services   - Our PBM solutions are described more fully below. 

Plan Design Offerings and Administration   - We administer pharmacy benefit plans for clients who contract with us to facilitate prescription coverage and claims processing for their eligible plan members. We assist our clients in designing pharmacy benefit plans that help improve health outcomes while minimizing the costs to the client. We also assist clients in monitoring the effectiveness of their plans through frequent, informal communications, their use of our proprietary software, as well as through formal annual, quarterly and sometimes monthly performance reviews. 

We make recommendations to help clients design benefit plans that promote the use of the lower cost, clinically appropriate drugs. We help our clients control costs by recommending plan designs that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available. Our clients also have the option, through plan design, to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products on their drug lists or  formularies,  which helps guide members to choose lower cost alternatives through appropriate financial incentives. 

Formulary Management   - We utilize an independent panel of doctors, pharmacists and other medical experts, referred to as our CVS Caremark National Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, to review and approve the selection of drugs that meet our high standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on one of our template formularies. Our formularies provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to help ensure member access to clinically appropriate drugs with alternatives within a class under the client s pharmacy benefit plan, while helping to drive the lowest net cost for our clients that select one of our formularies. To help improve clinical outcomes for members and clients, we conduct ongoing, independent reviews of all drugs, including, but not limited to, those appearing on the formularies and generic equivalent products. Many of our clients choose to adopt one of our template formulary offerings as part of their plan design. Beginning in 2018, clients will have new capabilities to offer real time benefits information for a member s specific plan design, provided digitally at the point of prescribing, at the pharmacy and directly to members.

Table of Contents  

Medicare Part D Services   - We participate in the administration of the drug benefit added to the Medicare program under Part D of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ) through the provision of PBM services to those of our health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as a Medicare Part D prescription drug plans ( PDP ) or as a Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan ( MA-PD ) and by offering Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits through SilverScript, a PDP that has contracted with the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). We also assist employer, union and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy made available under the MMA by collecting and submitting eligibility and/or drug cost data to CMS in order for them to obtain the subsidy and offer Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits to such clients' retirees through SilverScript-sponsored Employer Group Waiver Plans ( EGWPs ). 

Mail Order Pharmacy   - As of December 31, 2017, we operated four mail order dispensing pharmacies in the United States. Plan members or their prescribers submit prescriptions or refill requests, primarily for maintenance medications, to these pharmacies via mail, telephone, fax, e-prescribing or the Internet. We also operate a network of smaller mail order specialty pharmacies described below. Our staff pharmacists review mail order prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of our prescription management systems. This review may involve communications with the prescriber and, with the prescriber s approval when required, can result in generic substitution, therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to help reduce cost and/or improve quality of treatment. These pharmacies have been awarded Mail Order Pharmacy accreditation from Utilization Review Accreditation Commission ( URAC ), a Washington DC-based health care accrediting organization that establishes quality standards for the health care industry. 

Specialty Pharmacy   - Our specialty pharmacies support individuals who require complex and expensive drug therapies. As of December 31, 2017, our specialty pharmacy operations included 18 specialty mail order pharmacies located throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, that are used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases and disorders. These pharmacies have also been awarded Specialty Pharmacy accreditation from URAC. As of December 31, 2017, the Company operated a network of 23 retail specialty pharmacy stores, which operate under the CVS Pharmacy specialty services and Navarro      Health Services names. These stores average 1,100 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications, homeopathic remedies and vitamins. Our care management program, AccordantCare, is a differentiated clinical model that focuses on whole patient care, including comorbidity management. It embeds specially trained nurses into the CVS Specialty CareTeam for members who fill their specialty medications through CVS Specialty helping deliver better care and improved outcomes. Through our affiliate Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ), one of the nation s largest providers of comprehensive infusion services, we care for approximately 165,000 patients annually, providing specialty infusion and enteral nutrition services. Our Specialty Connect      offering integrates our specialty pharmacy mail and retail capabilities, providing members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the convenience of picking-up their prescriptions at their local CVS Pharmacy, or having them delivered to their preferred address. Whether submitted through our specialty mail order pharmacy or at a CVS Pharmacy, all prescriptions are filled through our specialty mail order pharmacies, so all revenue from this specialty prescription services program is recorded within the Pharmacy Services Segment. Members then can choose to pick up their medication at their local CVS Pharmacy, or have it sent to their home through the mail. Specialty Connect is available where allowed by law. Innovative digital tools for specialty pharmacy provide a more accessible, connected, and personal health experience. Members can manage all their specialty medications in real-time using the CVS Specialty app and more than 60 percent have opted in to receive email and text messages including refill reminders and order status. Patients can also use secure messaging to contact their Specialty CareTeam with any questions. Additionally, with the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ), we expanded our specialty pharmacy to include the specialty pharmacy operations of Omnicare which operates under the name ACS Pharmacy. 

Retail Pharmacy Network     Management   - We maintain a national network of more than 68,000 retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately 41,000 chain pharmacies (which includes our CVS Pharmacy locations) and 27,000 independent pharmacies, in the United States, including Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. When a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the point-of-sale. This data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems, which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility, while also performing a drug utilization review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription. We are also able to build client-specific networks and managed network solutions to further drive savings for our clients.   These include a   performance-based pharmacy network with approximately 30,000 stores that will be anchored by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens, along with up to 10,000 community-based, independently owned pharmacies across the United States. The network is designed to deliver unit cost savings and to improve clinical outcomes that will help to lower overall health

care costs for participating payors and their members. This network will be available beginning March 2018 to eligible commercial and Medicaid clients. 

Prescription Management Systems   - We dispense prescription drugs both directly, through one of our mail order or specialty pharmacies, or through a network of retail pharmacies, described above. All prescriptions processed through our systems, whether they are filled through one of our mail order or specialty dispensing pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network, are analyzed, processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems. These systems provide essential features and functionality to allow a plan member to use their prescription drug benefit. These systems also streamline the process by which prescriptions are processed by staff and network pharmacists, by enhancing review of various items through automation, including, but not limited to, plan eligibility, early refills, duplicate dispensing, appropriateness of dosage, drug interactions or allergies, over-utilization and potential fraud. 

Clinical Services   - We offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner. Our programs are primarily designed to promote good health outcomes, and to help target inappropriate utilization and non-adherence to medication, each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact member health and client pharmacy and medical spend. In this regard, we offer various utilization management ( UM ), medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement the client s plan design and clinical strategies. To help address the opioid epidemic, we introduced an industry-leading UM approach that limits to seven days the supply of opioids dispensed for certain acute prescriptions for patients who are new to therapy; limits the daily dosage of opioids dispensed based on the strength of the opioid; and requires the use of immediate-release formulations of opioids before extended-release opioids are dispensed. To support improved adherence, our Pharmacy Advisor program facilitates pharmacist counseling, both face-to-face and over the telephone, to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions. We also have digital connectivity that helps to lower drug costs for patients by providing expanded visibility to lower cost alternatives through enhanced analytics and data sharing.  

Disease Management Programs   - Our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers and other third parties. Our AccordantCare programs include integrated rare disease management programs, which cover diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson s disease, seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis. The majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ( NCQA ), a private, not-for-profit organization that evaluates, accredits and certifies a wide range of health care organizations. They have also been awarded Case Management accreditation from URAC. 

Medical Benefit Management   - We offer a technology platform, NovoLogix     , an online preauthorization tool that helps identify and capture cost savings opportunities for specialty drugs billed under the medical benefit by identifying outliers to appropriate dosages and costs, and helps to ensure clinically appropriate use of these drugs. 

Pharmacy Services Information Systems   - We currently operate and support a small number of claim adjudication platforms to support our Pharmacy Services Segment. However, the majority of our clients have migrated to one platform. These information systems incorporate architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail order prescriptions, adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and delivering other solutions to our PBM clients. Our Health Engagement Engine        technology and proprietary clinical algorithms help connect the various parts of the enterprise and serves an essential role in cost management and health improvement. This capability responsibly transforms pharmacy data into actionable interventions at key points of care such as our mail and specialty pharmacists to help provide quality care, and our enterprise digital strategy and integrated digital offerings help patients seamlessly manage mail, specialty and retail prescriptions. 

Pharmacy Services Clients   - Our clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part D plans, Managed Medicaid plans and plans offered on public and private exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals located throughout the United States. We provide pharmaceuticals to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems, among other things, to help perform safety checks, drug interaction screening and identify opportunities for generic substitution. We generate substantially all of our Pharmacy Services Segment net revenue from dispensing and managing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues from Aetna accounted for approximately 12.3%, 11.7% and 10.0%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues.

Pharmacy Services Seasonality   - The majority of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenues are not seasonal in nature. However, our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D standard benefit design results in coverage that varies with a member's cumulative annual out-of-pocket costs. The benefit design generally results in plan sponsors sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early part of the year. As a result, the PDP pay percentage or benefit ratio generally decreases and operating profit generally increases as the year progresses. 

Pharmacy Services Competition   - We believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include: (i) the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers as well as to negotiate favorable discounts from, and access to, retail pharmacy networks; (ii) the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies including the development and utilization of preferred formularies; (iii) the ability to market PBM products and services; (iv) the commitment to provide flexible, clinically-oriented services to clients and be responsive to clients  needs; (v) the quality, scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members including satisfaction of experience; and (vi) operational excellence in delivering services. The Pharmacy Services Segment has a significant number of competitors (e.g., Express Scripts, OptumRx, Prime Therapeutics, MedImpact, and Humana) offering PBM services including large, national PBM companies, PBMs owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone PBMs. 

Retail/LTC Segment 

As of December 31, 2017, the Retail/LTC Segment included 9,803 retail locations (of which 8,060 were our stores that operated a pharmacy and 1,695 were our pharmacies located within Target Corporation ( Target ) stores), our online retail pharmacy websites, CVS.com     , Navarro.com  TM   and Onofre.com.br  TM  , 37 onsite pharmacy stores, our long-term care pharmacy operations and our retail health care clinics. The retail locations are in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil, operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy     , CVS     , CVS Pharmacy y m s     , Longs Drugs     , Navarro Discount Pharmacy      and Drogaria Onofre  TM   names. Including the pharmacies within Target, we currently operate in all of the top 100 United States drugstore markets. Existing retail stores range in size from approximately 5,000 to 30,000 square feet, although most new stores range in size from approximately 11,000 to 15,000 square feet and typically include a drive-thru pharmacy. The pharmacies within Target stores range in size from approximately 450 to 1,100 square feet. During 2017, our Retail/LTC Segment filled approximately 1.2 billion prescriptions (counting 90-day prescriptions as three prescriptions), and we held approximately 23.6% of the United States retail pharmacy market.  

Our acquisition of Omnicare broadened our base of pharmacy care to an additional dispensing channel, long-term care pharmacy. Omnicare s LTC operations include the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. Omnicare also provided commercialization services under the name RxCrossroads until January 2, 2018, when we completed the sale of RxCrossroads. LTC is comprised of 145 spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders, of which 30 are also hub pharmacies that use automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC primarily operates under the Omnicare      and NeighborCare      names. With the addition of the LTC operations, we are continuing to enhance our service offerings to further address the needs of an aging population throughout the continuum of senior care. 

Retail Pharmacy Business Strategy   - Our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes. In that regard, the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services, including flu vaccinations as well as face-to-face patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies, closing gaps in care and recommending more cost effective drug therapies. We also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service, innovation and convenience. One of the keys to our strategy is technology, which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services. We are continuing to leverage digital to empower our customers and patients by making the full breadth of health care and pharmacy services available to them anytime, anywhere. We are continuing to introduce digital tools to make it easier for people to save time and money and to live healthier lives. In 2017, we rolled out CVS Pay        nationwide, an end-to-end mobile payment solution that integrates payment, prescription pick-up and our ExtraCare      loyalty program into one spot at checkout. We believe that continuing to innovate with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers  needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction.

The pharmacies within Target stores sell prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs that are required to be held behind the counter. The LTC operations include distribution of pharmaceuticals and related consulting and ancillary services. We purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not likely have a material effect on the business. Our clinics offer a variety of health care services by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. 

Retail/LTC net revenues by major product group are as follows: 

(1) 

Pharmacy includes LTC sales and sales in pharmacies within Target stores.     

(2) 

Other  represents less than 5% of the  Front store and other  net revenue category.     

Pharmacy   - Pharmacy revenues represented approximately three-fourths of the Retail Pharmacy Segment revenues in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. We believe that our retail pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to industry demographics, e.g., an aging American population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness, the introduction of new pharmaceutical products, and Medicare Part D. We believe our retail pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology, as well as our innovative partnerships with health plans, PBMs and providers. Given the nature of prescriptions, people want their prescriptions filled accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology, and ready when promised. Consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars. To assist our customers with these needs, we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier, easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs, improve health, and save lives. Examples include: our Patient Care Initiative, an enhanced medication adherence program; Maintenance Choice     , a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions through delivery to their home or business or at our CVS Pharmacy retail stores for the same price as mail order; Pharmacy Advisor     , our program that facilitates pharmacist counseling, both face-to-face and over the telephone, to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions; Specialty Connect     , which integrates our specialty pharmacy mail and retail capabilities, providing members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the convenience of picking-up their prescriptions at their local CVS Pharmacy, or having them delivered to their preferred address; ScriptSync     , a service that enables patients with multiple medications to pick up their eligible maintenance prescriptions in a single monthly CVS Pharmacy visit; S  criptPath      Prescription Schedule, a new capability for CVS Pharmacy patients, who manage multiple prescription medications, which features all of a patient s current CVS Pharmacy prescription information in one place   including which medications the patient takes, when the patient should take them and how much of each medication should be taken in each dose; and HealthTag     , an integrated communications platform that can be leveraged to communicate healthcare opportunities to members that provides unmatched ability to reach and connect with members as well as industry-leading data integration to improve coordination of member care.   Each of these are programs that demonstrate our ability to enhance the customer experience through our integrated enterprise products and services. Further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology, such as our Drug Utilization Review system that helps check for harmful interactions between prescription drugs and patient identified over-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal remedies; RxConnect, our proprietary pharmacy system that integrates our product delivery and clinical workflows as well as advanced patient safety functionality such as drug utilization review; our prescription refill program, ReadyFill    and our online retail businesses, CVS.com, Navarro.com and Onofre.com.br. Our Health Engagement Engine enables patient-specific opportunities to be prioritized and delivered at each key moment of care relevant to that specific patient. In December 2015, we expanded our pharmacy offering with the acquisition of the

pharmacies within Target stores. We offer all the same pharmacy services available in our retail drugstores and online at our pharmacies within Target stores.    

Front Store   - Front store revenues benefited from our strategy to innovate with new and unique products and services, using innovative personalized marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers  needs and preferences. A key component of our front store strategy is our ExtraCare      card program, which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base. The ExtraCare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the United States. The ExtraCare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices, customized coupons, ExtraBucks      rewards and other benefits. We continue to launch and enhance new and exclusive brands to create unmatched offerings in beauty. Another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings, which include a full range of high-quality CVS Pharmacy      and proprietary brand products that are only available through CVS Pharmacy stores. We currently carry approximately 7,000 CVS Pharmacy and proprietary brand products, which accounted for approximately 23% of our front store revenues during 2017. These products include expanded offerings of healthy foods and vitamins. Furthermore, we are tailoring certain groups of stores, such as suburban area stores, to better meet the needs of our customers.  

MinuteClinic -   As of December 31, 2017, we operated 1,134 MinuteClinic      locations in 33 states and the District of Columbia, of which 1,050 were located in our retail pharmacy stores, and 79 were located in Target stores. We opened 15 new clinics during 2017. Our clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally established guidelines to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions, provide wellness services and deliver vaccinations. Payors value our clinics because they provide convenient, high-quality, cost-effective care, in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more expensive sites of care. As a result, visits paid for by employers, health insurers or other third parties accounted for approximately 91% of MinuteClinic s total revenues in 2017. MinuteClinic is collaborating with our Pharmacy Services Segment to help meet the needs of CVS Caremark s client plan members by offering programs that can improve member health and lower costs. MinuteClinic is now affiliated with more than 75 major health systems and continues to build a platform that supports primary care.  

Long-term Care   - Through our Omnicare business, we provide the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. Omnicare s customers consist of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, independent living communities, hospitals, correctional facilities, and other health care service providers. We provide pharmacy consulting, including monthly patient drug therapy evaluations, assist in compliance with state and federal regulations and provide proprietary clinical and health management programs. We also provide pharmaceutical case management services for retirees, employees and dependents who have drug benefits under corporate-sponsored health care programs. 

Onsite Pharmacies   - We also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites, typically under the CarePlus     , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy      or CVS Pharmacy       name, which provide certain health plan members and customers with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions. 

Retail Pharmacy Drugstore Development   - The addition of new stores has played, and will continue to play, a key role in our continued growth and success. Our store development program focuses on three areas: entering new markets, adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient sites. During 2017, we opened 175 new retail locations, relocated 30 stores and closed 81 locations. During the last five years, we opened approximately 1,000 new and relocated locations, and acquired 1,880 locations including the pharmacies acquired from Target. We believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in more accessible markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current health care environment. As a result, we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position given the changing health care landscape and to meet the increasing needs of our customers. 

Retail/LTC Information Systems   - We have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver exceptional customer service, enhance safety and quality, and expand our patient care services while lowering operating costs. Our proprietary WeCARE Workflow supports our pharmacy teams by prioritizing work to meet customer expectations, facilitating prescriber outreach, and seamlessly integrating our clinical programs. This solution delivers improved efficiency and enhances the customer experience, as well as providing a framework to accommodate the evolution of pharmacy practice and the expansion of our clinical programs. Our Health Engagement Engine technology and proprietary clinical algorithms enable us to help identify opportunities for our pharmacists to deliver face-to-face

counseling regarding patient health and safety matters, including adherence issues, gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions. Our digital strategy empowers the consumer to navigate their pharmacy experience and manage their condition through our on-line and mobile tools that offer utility and convenience. This includes the ability to schedule an appointment at MinuteClinic, get next-in line alerts or health reminders and appointment updates via text messages. Our integrated digital offerings help patients seamlessly manage retail, mail and specialty prescriptions dispensed by a CVS Pharmacy or LTC location and enhance front store personalization to drive value for customers. We continue to experience strong adoption of our digital solutions with our mobile app receiving critical acclaim for ease of use and our text message program experiencing significant growth. LTC s digital technology suite, Omniview     , improves the efficiency of customers  operations with tools that include executive dashboards, pre-admission pricing, electronic ordering of prescription refills, proof-of-delivery tracking, access to patient profiles, receipt and management of facility bills, and real-time validation of Medicare Part D coverage, among other capabilities. 

Retail/LTC Customers   - The success of our retail drugstore and LTC businesses is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers and other payors on acceptable terms. Pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, government-funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third party payors accounted for 99.2% of our 2017 pharmacy revenues. No single Retail/LTC payor accounts for 10% or more of our annual consolidated net revenues. 

Retail/LTC Seasonality   - The majority of our revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, are generally not seasonal in nature. However, retail front store revenues tend to be higher during the December holiday season. In addition, both pharmacy and retail front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season. For additional information, we refer you to  Risks related to the seasonality of our business  in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Retail/LTC Competition   - The retail drugstore business is highly competitive. We believe that we compete principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience, (ii) customer service and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety, and (iv) price. In the markets we serve, we compete with other drugstore chains (e.g., Walgreens and Rite Aid), supermarkets, discount retailers (e.g., Wal-Mart), independent pharmacies, restrictive pharmacy networks, membership clubs, Internet companies, and retail health clinics (including urgent care centers), as well as other mail order pharmacies. 

LTC pharmaceutical services are highly regional or local in nature and within a given geographic area of operation, highly competitive. Our largest competitor nationally is PharMerica. We also compete with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned by long-term care facilities and local retail pharmacies. Some states have enacted  freedom of choice  or  any willing provider  requirements as part of their state Medicaid programs or in separate legislation, which may increase the competition that we face in providing services to long-term care facility residents in these states. 

Corporate Segment 

Our Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the overall operations of the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of our executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments. 

Generic Sourcing Venture 

The Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ( Cardinal ) each have a 50% ownership in Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ( Red Oak ), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. 

Working Capital Practices 

We fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and long-term borrowings. For additional information on our working capital practices, we refer you to the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources  in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017, which section is

incorporated by reference herein. The majority of our non-pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards. Managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, government-funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third party insurance programs, which represent the vast majority of our consolidated pharmacy revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. With the exception of our Medicare Part D services, the remainder of our consolidated pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards. As a provider of Medicare Part D services, we contract annually with CMS. Utilization of services each plan year results in the accumulation of either a receivable from or a payable to CMS. The timing of settlement of the receivable or payable with CMS takes several quarters which impacts our working capital from year to year. 

Colleague Development 

As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 246,000 colleagues in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil, which included approximately 36,000 pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The total included approximately 86,000 part-time colleagues who work less than 30 hours per week. To deliver the highest levels of service to our customers, we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards. We emphasize attracting and training knowledgeable, friendly and helpful associates to work in our organization. 

Intellectual Property 

We have registered and/or applied to register a variety of our trademarks and service marks used throughout our business, as well as domain names, and rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, in addition to contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value in our Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments. We are not aware of any facts that could materially impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property. 

Government Regulation 

Overview   - Much of our business is subject to federal and state laws and regulations. In addition, many of our PBM clients and our payors in the Retail/LTC Segment, including insurers, Medicare Part D plans, Managed Medicaid plans and managed care organizations ( MCOs ), are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor. Similarly, our LTC clients, such as skilled nursing facilities, are subject to government regulations, including many of the same government regulations to which we are subject. The application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty. Further, there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels, some of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted. We are unable to predict what federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general, or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on our business. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations as summarized below, or any adverse applications of, or changes in, the laws and regulations affecting our business, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and/or financial condition. See Item 3,  Legal Proceedings  for further information. 

Although we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our various business lines, we cannot give any assurances that our business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected, or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations, including the laws and regulations described in this Government Regulation section, as they may relate to our business, the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or to the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally; (iv) institution of government enforcement actions against us; (v) adverse developments in any pending   qui tam   lawsuit against us, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future   qui tam   lawsuit that may be filed against us; or (vi) adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services, retail pharmacy, long-term care or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally.

Laws and Regulations Related to Each Operating Segment of Our Business 

Laws Related to Reimbursement by Government Programs   - We are subject to various state and federal laws concerning our submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored health care programs. Potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, multiples damages, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act ( FCA ), the federal Anti-Kickback statute, various state false claims acts and anti-kickback statutes, the federal  Stark Law  and related state laws. In particular, the FCA prohibits intentionally submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively,  ACA ), the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended in 2010 to provide that any claim for government reimbursement violates the FCA where it results from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file   qui tam   or  whistleblower  lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government. Further, the federal Stark Law generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient prescription drugs, to any entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral. Various states have enacted similar laws. 

Anti-Remuneration Laws -   Federal law prohibits, among other things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject to certain exceptions and  safe harbors,  any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal health care programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment, criminal and civil fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored health care programs. 

Antitrust and Unfair Competition   - The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTCA ) to investigate and prosecute practices that are  unfair trade practices  or  unfair methods of competition.  Numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies and/or PBMs under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging, among other things: (i) brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, (ii) the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by PBMs, and (iii) various other business practices of PBMs and retail pharmacies. To the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or CVS Pharmacy or CVS Specialty plays a unique or expanded role in a PBM product offering, our business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anti-competitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties. 

Privacy and Confidentiality Requirements   - Many of our activities involve the receipt, use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information ( PII ) as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws, which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information. In addition to PII, we use and disclose de-identified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted. Additionally, there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit     credit card information maintain a secure environment. Certain states have recently incorporated these requirements into state laws. 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively,  HIPAA ) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, health care providers, health care clearinghouses (known as  covered entities ) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information ( PHI ). Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with HIPAA standards. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the  HITECH Act ), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, amended HIPAA to impose additional restrictions on third-party funded communications using PHI and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for PHI. It also extended HIPAA privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates. In addition to HIPAA, state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA. 

12 

Table of Contents  

Finally, the Health Insurance Marketplaces (formerly known as the  exchanges ) are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to PII, and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of PII as those the Health Insurance Marketplace has implemented for itself or non-Health Insurance Marketplace entities, which include insurers offering plans through the Health Insurance Marketplaces and their designated downstream entities, including PBMs and other business associates. These standards may differ from, and be more stringent than, HIPAA. 

Consumer Protection Laws   - The federal government has many consumer protection laws, such as the FTCA, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. These laws have been the basis for investigations, lawsuits and multi-state settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs and health care services, pricing accuracy, expired front store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs and disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected. 

Government Agreements and Mandates   - The Company and/or its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees, settlement agreements, corrective action plans and corporate integrity agreements with various federal, state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices, controlled substances, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, expired products, environmental and safety matters, marketing and advertising practices, PBM, long term care and pharmacy operations and various other business practices. These agreements may contain certain ongoing reporting, monitoring or other compliance requirements for the Company. Failure to meet the Company s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies, financial penalties, administrative remedies, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. 

Environmental and Safety Regulation   - Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment, public health and employee safety, including, for example, regulations governing the management of hazardous substances, the cleaning up of contaminated sites, and the maintenance of safe working conditions in our stores, distribution centers and other facilities. Governmental agencies on the federal, state and local levels have, in recent years, increasingly focused on the retail and health care sectors  compliance with such laws and regulations, and have at times pursued enforcement activities. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities. 

Health Reform Legislation   - Passed in 2010, ACA affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country. In addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage, ACA enacted a number of significant health care reforms. Many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients. As a result, these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices. Some significant ACA provisions are still being finalized (e.g., implementation of the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage has been delayed by Congress) and parts of ACA may still face potential Congressional changes, so the full impact of ACA on our Company is still uncertain. 

Pharmacy and Professional Licensure and Regulation   - We are subject to a variety of intersecting state and federal statutes and regulations that govern the wholesale distribution of drugs; operation of retail, specialty, infusion, LTC and mail order pharmacies; licensure of facilities and professionals, including pharmacists, technicians and nurses; registration of facilities with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and analogous state agencies that regulate controlled substances; packaging, storing, shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals; repackaging of drug products; labeling, medication guides and other consumer disclosures; interactions with prescribers and health care professionals; compounding of prescription medications; dispensing of controlled and non-controlled substances; counseling of patients; transfers of prescriptions; advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services; security; inventory control; recordkeeping; reporting to Boards of Pharmacy, the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the DEA and related state agencies; and other elements of pharmacy practice. Pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with a wide variety of local, state and federal agencies, with various powers to investigate, inspect, audit or solicit information, including Boards of Pharmacy and Nursing, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Justice, the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and others. Many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers, conduct audits on a regular basis, can impose substantial fines and penalties, and may revoke the license, registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional.

Table of Contents  

Telemarketing and Other Outbound Contacts   - Certain federal and state laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. 

Laws and Regulations Related to Our Pharmacy Services Segment 

In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole, we are subject to federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our Pharmacy Services Segment specifically. Among these are the following: 

PBM Laws and Regulation   - Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states. This legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect. 

In addition, certain quasi-regulatory organizations, including the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBM activities. Similarly, credentialing organizations such as NCQA and URAC may establish voluntary standards regarding PBM, mail or specialty pharmacy activities. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting organizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for PBM or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients and/or the services we provide to them. 

Medicare Part D   - The Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through private insurers, regulates all aspects of the provision of Medicare drug coverage, including enrollment, formularies, pharmacy networks, marketing, and claims processing. The Medicare Part D program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception, and continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny. The applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve. CMS has imposed restrictions and issued new requirements to protect Medicare Part D beneficiaries and has used its authority to sanction and impose civil monetary penalties on plans for non-compliance. 

Network Access Legislation   - Medicare Part D and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. For example, certain  any willing provider  legislation may require us or our clients to admit a non-participating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation. These laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network. 

Also, a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability (and the health plans  ability) to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to us for payment. These laws could negatively impact our ability to recover overpayments in health care payments stemming from pharmacy audits. Lastly, several states have passed legislation regulating our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs ( MAC ) for generic prescription drugs. MAC methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors (including CMS) to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs. MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies, the kinds of drugs that a PBM can pay at a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could negatively impact our ability to establish MAC prices for generic drugs. 

Contract Audits   - We are subject to audits of many of our contracts, including our PBM client contracts, our PBM rebate contracts, our PBM network contracts, our contracts relating to Medicare Part D and the agreements our pharmacies enter into with other payors. Because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies, audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs, including those which operate Medicaid fee for service plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare Part D plans or Medicare Advantage organizations. 

14 

Table of Contents  

Federal Employee Health Benefits Program   - We have a contractual arrangement with carriers for the Federal Employee Health Benefits ( FEHB ) Program, such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal workers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the FEHB Act and as part of the FEHB Program. These arrangements subjects us to certain aspects of FEHB Act, and other federal regulations, such as the FEHB Acquisition Regulation, that otherwise are not applicable to us. 

State Insurance Laws   - PDPs and our PBM service contracts, including those in which we assume certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements, are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states. However, state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of PBM activities due to legislation passing in several states requiring PBMs to register or obtain a license with the department. Rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a few states with the areas of focus on licensure requirements, pharmacy reimbursement for generics (MAC reimbursement) and pharmacy audits - most of which fall under the state insurance code. Additionally, some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company. These state laws vary, and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

As a PDP, SilverScript is subject to state insurance laws limited to licensure and solvency. In addition, PBM offerings of prescription drug coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states. Such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer, establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability. Laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing MCOs and limited prepaid health service plans. 

ERISA Regulation   - The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ), provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans, including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide PBM services. In general, we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors. We do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of ERISA, except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility, such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims and/or the appeals of denied claims under a plan, and with respect to the Contraceptive Coverage Mandate, one of the health reforms presently included in ACA. 

In addition to its fiduciary provisions, ERISA imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received. These provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain. 

Formulary and Plan Design Regulation   - A number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. HHS regulates how Medicare Part D formularies are developed and administered, including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories, subject to limited exceptions. Under ACA, CMS imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits, including plans offered through federal or state exchanges. Additionally, NAIC and health care accreditation agencies like NCQA and URAC have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements. Many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. The increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies, networks and other plan design features on behalf of our insurer, MCO and other clients. Similarly, some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive design features. This regulation could limit or preclude (i) limited networks, (ii) a requirement to use particular providers, (iii) copayment differentials among providers and (iv) formulary tiering practices. 

Managed Care Reform   - In addition to health reforms enacted by ACA, proposed legislation has been considered at the state level, and legislation has been enacted in several states, aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans. This legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our PBM health plan clients and/or the services we provide to them. Both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly, and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain.

Disease Management Services Regulation   - We provide disease management programs to PBM plan members for rare medical conditions and arrange for them to receive disease management programs for common medical conditions. State laws regulate the practice of medicine, the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing. Clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of disease management services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice. 

Third Party Administration and Other State Licensure Laws   - Many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations, such as preferred provider organizations, third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services. Several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs (also known as cash card or discount card programs). 

Laws and Regulations Related to Our Retail/LTC Segment 

In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole, we are subject to federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our Retail/LTC Segment specifically. Among these are the following: 

Specific FDA Regulation   - The FDA generally has authority to, among other things, regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and labeling of many products sold through retail pharmacies, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, medical devices (including mobile medical devices), cosmetics, dietary supplements and certain food items. 

Retail Clinics   - States regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight, lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine. A number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight, signage, third party contracting requirements, bathroom facilities, and scope of services. These laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of our owned and managed retail clinics.

Item 1A. Risk Factors   

Our business is subject to various industry, economic, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial: 

Risks of declining gross margins in the PBM, retail pharmacy and LTC pharmacy industries. 

The PBM industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices, increased revenue sharing, enhanced service offerings and/or higher service levels. In that regard, we maintain contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Manufacturer rebates often depend on a PBM s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements, including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer s products on the PBM s formularies. If we lose our relationship with one   

16 

Table of Contents  

or more pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Further, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail  differential  or  spread , which could negatively impact our future profitability. Further, changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, or to formulary management or other PBM services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive. In addition, changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing, including our ability to use MAC lists and collect transmission fees, could adversely impact our profitability. 

Our retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and LTC pharmacy operations have also been affected by the margin pressures described above, including client demands for lower prices, generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure. In addition, as competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. A shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our margins, including the shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day prescriptions at retail and the shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions. Finally, the margins of our LTC business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements. These actions could also adversely affect the margins of our LTC business. 

Efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices. 

The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBMs, government entities, and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may impact our profitability. In particular, increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs) has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail, specialty, LTC and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in the generic profit rate. Historically, the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers. However, in recent years, there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry, and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased costs or to modify our activities to lessen the impact could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. 

In addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels. Efforts to control health care costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuing at the federal and state government levels. Changing political, economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices. For example, we anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems, payment methodologies and operational requirements for health care providers, including LTC facilities and pharmacies. A change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability. Any action taken to repeal or replace all or significant parts of ACA could also impact our profitability, though it is unclear at this time what the full effects will be. 

ACA made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and to reimbursement. One of these changes was to revise the definition of the Average Manufacturer Price, a pricing element common to most payment formulas, and the reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs. This change has negatively affected our reimbursement. In addition, ACA made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients, including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees. These ACA changes may not affect our business directly, but they could indirectly impact our services and/or business practices. 

A highly competitive business environment. 

Each of our retail pharmacy, LTC pharmacy, retail health clinic and pharmacy services operations currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment.

Table of Contents  

The competitive success of our retail pharmacy business, as well as our specialty pharmacy operations with non-Caremark payors, is derived by their ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms in an environment where some PBM clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks. As a pharmacy retail business, we compete with other drugstore chains, supermarkets, on-line and other discount retailers, independent pharmacies, membership clubs, convenience stores and mass merchants, some of which are aggressively expanding into markets we serve. We also face competition from other retail health clinics, as well as other mail order pharmacies and PBMs. Disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. Changes in market dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation, the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, and the exclusion from new narrow or restricted networks, could materially and adversely impact us. 

We could also be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. For example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy operations focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. 

The competitive success of our LTC pharmacy operations is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operations. In the geographic regions we serve, we compete with PharMerica, our largest competitor, as well as with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned by long-term care facilities and local retail pharmacies. Our long-term care customers consist of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, independent living communities, hospitals, correctional facilities, and other health care service providers. We believe that the assisted living segment, where residents can choose which pharmacy will provide them with pharmaceuticals, is projected to grow the most as a percentage of the total LTC sector over the near term. The ability of a resident of an assisted living facility to select the pharmacy that supplies him or her with pharmaceuticals could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations because there can be no assurance that such resident will select us. 

The competitive success of our pharmacy services business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some PBM clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks. Competitors in the PBM industry (e.g., Express Scripts, OptumRx, Prime Therapeutics, MedImpact and Humana), include large, national PBM companies, PBMs owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone PBMs. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. In addition, changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could adversely affect our claims volume and/or our competitiveness generally. 

Competitors in each of our business areas may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer. Strong competition in the PBM marketplace has generated greater client demand for lower pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. Unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings, particularly in a rapidly changing health care industry, we may be unable to remain competitive. 

Changes in U.S. policy, laws and regulations, including reform of the United States health care system. 

The results of the November 2016 elections continue to generate some uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care and retail industries. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take (including through the use of Executive Orders), specific proposals discussed by the Presidential Administration could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations include, but are not limited to, immigration policies, the modification of ACA. Other significant changes to health care system legislation or regulation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries are also possible. 

18 

Table of Contents  

Potential modification to ACA, significant changes to Medicaid funding or even significant destabilization of the Health Insurance Marketplaces could impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage. Further changes to ACA are possible and we cannot predict the effect, if any, on future changes to ACA, the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of ACA, or the enactment of new health care system legislation to replace current legislation may have on our retail pharmacy, LTC pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and pharmacy services operations. 

In addition, much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our retail, mail and specialty pharmacies, and much of the other merchandise we sell, is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the United States. In most cases, the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us. As a result, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could result in significant increases in our costs, restrict our access to suppliers, depress economic activity, and have a material impact on our business, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes, as well as any negative sentiments towards the United States in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade regulations, could adversely affect our business. 

Risks related to compliance with a broad and complex regulatory framework. 

Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. See  Business - Government Regulation.  In addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels. Further, uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business. In addition, it is possible that certain provisions of the current health care reform legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated. Changes in these laws and regulations and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; significant fines or monetary penalties; suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; or loss of registrations or licensure. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: the laws and regulations described in the Government Regulation section; accounting standards; financial disclosure; securities laws and regulations; federal anti-trust laws; tax laws and regulations and their possible reform; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous materials and wastes; and laws and regulations of the FTC, the FCC, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products that we sell, such as Boards of Pharmacy. The FDA, DEA and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various states  controlled substances acts and their accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses, seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, our business interests outside of the United States are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. We are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates, including those described in the Government Regulation section. In that regard, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new government legislative, regulatory action and enforcement activity, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following: 

federal and state laws and regulations concerning the submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs, whether at retail, mail, specialty or LTC;     

federal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, tracking, management, compounding, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services, whether at retail, mail, specialty or LTC, and applicable registration or licensing requirements;     

heighted enforcement of controlled substances regulations;     

the effect of the expiration of patents covering brand name drugs and the introduction of generic products;

ongoing compliance with consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, corrective action plans and other agreements with government agencies;      

insurance licensing and other insurance regulatory requirements applicable to offering Medicare Part D programs and services or other health care services; and     

direct regulation of pharmacies or PBMs by regulatory and quasi-regulatory bodies.     

The possibility of client losses and/or the failure to win new business. 

Our PBM business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. PBM client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration, so approximately one third of a PBM s client base typically is subject to renewal each year. In some cases, however, PBM clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract. Our clients are generally well informed and organized, can move between our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration of their contracts. In addition, the reputational impact of a service-related incident could negatively affect our business. These factors, together with the impact of competitive pressures, could make it difficult for us to attract new clients, retain existing clients and cross-sell additional services. Further, the PBM industry has been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future. In the event one or more of our PBM clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client, we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business. These circumstances, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Therefore, we continually face challenges in competing for new PBM business and retaining or renewing our existing PBM business. With respect to our LTC business, reimbursement from skilled nursing facilities for prescriptions we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreements with those skilled nursing facilities. The termination of these agreements generally causes our ability to provide services to any of the residents of that facility to cease, resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those residents. There can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms. 

20 

Table of Contents  

Additionally, with respect to our retail and LTC pharmacy businesses, reimbursement under Medicare Part D, as well as reimbursement from certain private third-party payors, is determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representatives. The loss of those agreements, or a material change in the terms of those agreements, could negatively impact the Company. In addition, restricted networks that exclude our retail or specialty pharmacies negatively impact those businesses. 

Risks relating to the market availability, suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell. 

We dispense significant volumes of brand-name and generic drugs from our retail, LTC, specialty and mail-order pharmacies and through our PBM s network of retail pharmacies. When increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur, or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances, physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced. 

Additionally, adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs. On occasion, products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to over-the-counter products, which can result in lower prescription utilization. In addition, future FDA rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers. Our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes. 

Further, we acquire a substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacies  prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers. Our agreements with these suppliers are often short-term and easily cancelable by either party without cause. In addition, these agreements may limit our ability to provide services for competing drugs during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than ours. Certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels. A termination or modification to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, many products distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. In some cases, we depend upon a single source of supply.  

In addition, our suppliers are independent entities subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside our control. If our current suppliers were to stop selling prescription drugs to us or delay delivery, including as a result of supply shortages, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcies of our suppliers, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. 

A disruption in our business operations could occur as a result of contamination of drugs, a failure to maintain necessary shipment and storage conditions, errors in mail order processing, the unavailability of prescription drugs provided by suppliers, labor disruptions or other unanticipated disruptions at our mail order facilities, call centers, data centers or corporate facilities, among other factors. Such disruption could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our customers. 

In the event any products we distribute are in limited supply for significant periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction and pricing of generic drugs and brand name prescription products. 

The profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products, as the sale of generic alternatives normally yield higher gross margins than brand name equivalents. In addition, inflation in the price of the brand name drugs can affect utilization, particularly given the increase in high deductible health plans. Accordingly, our business could be impacted by a slowdown or delay in the number or magnitude of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals and/or generic alternatives, as well as the pricing of brand name drugs.

The health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve. 

Our business is affected by the economy and consumer confidence in general, including various economic factors, inflation and changes in consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns. It is possible that an unfavorable, uncertain or volatile economic environment will cause a decline in drug and health care services utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores. Further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations, changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute sale-leaseback transactions under acceptable terms. These changes in conditions could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. This could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health plan designs favoring co-insurance over co-payments. 

The failure or disruption of our information technology systems, our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of     sensitive customer and business information. 

Many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected, processed, stored, and handled by these systems. We rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, claims processing, ExtraCare customer loyalty program, finance, human resource and other processes. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain confidential information, including PII that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services, enroll in programs or services, register on our websites, interact with our personnel, or otherwise communicate with us. In addition, for these operations, we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, coordinated cyber attacks, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities, including ones from a cyber security standpoint, designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Moreover, a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payors and vendors. 

If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our PBM claims adjudication platforms, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience reputational damage, loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. In addition, compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. 

Failure to adequately protect receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals.  

Many aspects of our business involve the collection, transmission and use of an individual s protected health information or other sensitive personal information. In some cases, we also use aggregated and de-identified data as defined by HIPAA for analytical and research purposes, particularly data related to improving the quality of the care we provide.  In other cases, we may provide de-identified data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and to third-party data aggregators where permitted by our contracts. These activities are subject to federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations and, in the future, may be subject to international regulatory requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation, a new European Union privacy regulation that takes effect on May 25, 2018. At the federal level, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health   

22 

Table of Contents  

information by all participants in the health care industry, whether directly as a covered entity or as a business associate. Our business encompasses both situations and includes our pharmacists, nurse practitioners and PBM operations. In addition, industry requirements, such as Generally Accepted Privacy Principles may be imposed on us by our contracts with our PBM clients or other customers. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a  security standard mandated by the credit card industry for the purpose of protecting credit card account data. These increasingly complex laws, regulations and industry requirements are subject to change and compliance with them may result in significant expenses associated with increased operational and compliance costs, particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of information. To the extent that either we or our vendors with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, we could be subject to additional litigation, regulatory risks and reputational harm. For example, the privacy and security of the information we maintain may be compromised by the actions of outside parties, by employee errors or by malfeasance. Such risks may result in an unauthorized party obtaining access to our data systems thereby threatening the privacy of protected health information or other sensitive personal information we use and maintain. Failure to comply with federal or state statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In addition, failure to comply with our own privacy or security policies may result in sanctions by the FTC or other federal oversight agencies. Future regulations and legislation that severely restrict or prohibit our use of patient, member or customer identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business. Furthermore, if we violate a patient s privacy or are found to have violated any federal or state statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of PHI, we could be liable for significant damages, fines or penalties and suffer reputational harm, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in Medicare Part D. 

Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization and puts pressure on pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures. Further, as a result of ACA and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules, our PBM clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D business. In addition, if the cost and complexity of Medicare Part D exceed management s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; if changes to the regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; if the government alters Medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; if the government mandates the use of point-of-sale manufacturer rebates or makes changes to how pharmacy pay-for-performance is calculated; if Congress acts to reduce reinsurance thresholds from 80% to 20%; if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to Medicare participants; if CMS imposes restrictions on our Medicare Part D business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions; if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by CMS; or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees, or winning contract renewals or new contracts under Medicare Part D s competitive bidding process, our Medicare Part D services and the ability to expand our Medicare Part D services could be negatively impacted. 

Possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally. 

It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace Average Wholesale Price ( AWP ) or Wholesale Acquisition Cost ( WAC ), which are the pricing references used for many of our PBM and LTC client contracts, pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs ( FFS Medicaid ) have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of Actual Acquisition Cost ( AAC ). The use of an AAC basis in FFS Medicaid could have an impact in reimbursement practices in other commercial and government segments. Future changes to the use of AWP, WAC or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs, the reimbursement we receive from PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs and retail pharmacies. A failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Table of Contents  

Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time. 

Product liability, product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation; failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage. 

The products that we sell could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling, recall or other damage. In addition, errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our business involves the provision of professional services including by pharmacists, nurses and nurse practitioners that exposes us to professional liability claims. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and the demand for our products and services, including propriety brands. 

The success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty, superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores and online sites and to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, and evolving demographic mixes in our markets, an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers, or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products. 

We offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites. The sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls, potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products, our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties, and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell private-label products. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which, consequently, could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, that customer confidence is not diminished. Any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty. 

Finally, our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients. As a result, the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks related to developing and maintaining a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers. 

Our business has evolved from a retail store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining mobile commerce   

24 

Table of Contents  

applications for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations. 

We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations. 

We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, mobile payments and potentially other technologies in the future. Acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment options, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and various other forms of electronic payment. If these companies are unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, our operations could be disrupted. The payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to, or exploit any weaknesses in, the payment systems. If we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements, or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse, we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition, our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our results of operations. 

Solvency of our customers. 

In the event that our customers' operating and financial performance deteriorates, or they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain adequate financing, our customers may not be able to pay timely, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us. Any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both state and federal government sponsored payers, as a result of budget deficits or reductions, may suspend payments or seek to reduce their healthcare expenditures resulting in our customers delaying payments to us or renegotiating their contracts with us. Any delay or reduction in payments by such government sponsored payers may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our outstanding debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt. 

Our current debt service costs associated with our increased debt levels may negatively impact our ability to make important investments in our business and limit our flexibility to respond to industry changes and market conditions. In addition, our debt levels and related debt service obligations could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes in the future. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. 

Further, we may incur and assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with the Aetna Acquisition or other acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. For example, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, if it is completed, we expect to incur approximately, $45.0 billion of new indebtedness and assume approximately $8.2 billion of existing indebtedness of Aetna. If we do not retire our existing debt or debt we assume in acquisitions or other strategic transactions, the risks described above could increase. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing indebtedness when it expires, and by any failure to satisfy applicable covenants. 

We may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or otherwise access the capital markets for any reason, whether due to market conditions or otherwise. Our continued access to the capital markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, the amount of our   

25 

Table of Contents  

indebtedness and debt service obligations and our credit ratings. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.  

Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to secure indebtedness with a security interest on certain property or stock or engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain properties. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed specified levels. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and if we fail to comply with such restrictions or covenants, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. 

We may be unable to successfully integrate companies acquired by us. 

Upon the closing of any acquisition we complete, we will need to successfully integrate the products, services and related assets, as well as internal controls into our business operations. If an acquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, its products, services and related assets into our company may also be complex and time-consuming and, if the integration is not fully successful, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following: 

Integrating personnel, operations and systems, while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent, high quality products and services;     

Coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;     

Disruption of management s attention from our ongoing business operations;     

Retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; and     

Managing inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations.     

An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies, innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. Furthermore, these acquisitions, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products, services or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them. 

Risks related to the seasonality of our business. 

Although the majority of our revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, are generally not seasonal in nature, front store revenues tend to be higher during the December holiday season. Uncharacteristic or extreme weather conditions can adversely impact consumer shopping patterns as well. This could lead to lost sales, as well as increased snow removal and other costs, thereby negatively affecting our short-term results of operations. In addition, both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which is susceptible to large fluctuations from year to year, and our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. See  Business - Pharmacy Services Seasonality.  

Our operations are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks, any of which could interrupt operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance and results. 

We are subject to business continuity hazards and other risks, including natural disasters, utility and other mechanical failures, acts of war or terrorism, disruption of communications, data security and preservation, disruption of supply or distribution, safety regulation and labor difficulties. The occurrence of any of these or other events might disrupt or shut down operations, or otherwise adversely impact our operations. We may also be subject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life, or damage to property, resulting from such events. Although we have developed business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and   

26 

Table of Contents  

industry, our insurance policies include limits and, as such, our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. Should any such hazards or risks occur, or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable, our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings. 

Pharmacy services, retail pharmacy and LTC pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries. We are currently subject to various litigation matters, investigations, audits, inspections, government inquiries, and regulatory and legal proceedings. Litigation, and particularly securities and collective or class action litigation, is often expensive and disruptive. Further, under the   qui tam   or  whistleblower  provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, private citizens may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of  false  claims to federal and/or state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Litigation related to our provision of professional services in our pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, clinics and LTC facilities has also increased as we expand our services along the continuum of health care. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters, and the costs incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, or we may be required to materially change our business practices, as a result of such proceedings. We refer you to Item 3,  Legal Proceedings  for additional information. 

We face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success, and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance.  

Our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives and there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees, or an unexpected loss of leadership, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  

In addition, our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. 

Goodwill and other intangible assets could, in the future, become impaired. 

As of December 31, 2017, we had $52.1 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinitely-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, we first compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a comparable market multiple model. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

The foregoing is not a comprehensive listing of all possible risks and there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting the business. As such, we refer you to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  which includes our  Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements  at the end of such section, of our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017, which section is incorporated by reference herein.

Aetna-Related Risk Factors   In addition to the risk factors described above that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, the following risk factors, and additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also materially adversely affect us and the Aetna Acquisition. 

In order to complete the merger, we and Aetna must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such authorizations are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the merger may be jeopardized or prevented or the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced.  

Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the HSR Act and certain other applicable laws or regulations and the required governmental authorizations having been obtained and being in full force and effect. Although we and Aetna have agreed in the merger agreement to use our reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings or obtain the governmental authorizations required to complete the merger (the  required governmental authorizations ), as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or authorizations will be obtained and no assurance that the merger will be completed.  

In addition, the governmental authorities from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the merger, including other potential transactions in the health care industry or other industries. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the merger. As a condition to authorization of the merger or related transactions, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we are not required, and Aetna is not permitted without our consent, to take any actions or agree to any terms or conditions in connection with (i) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the HSR Act, (ii) any other antitrust law or (iii) the required governmental authorizations, in each case if such action, term or condition would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a regulatory material adverse effect on us or Aetna.  

However, notwithstanding the provisions of the merger agreement, either we or Aetna could become subject to terms or conditions in connection with such waiting periods, laws or other authorizations (whether because such term or condition does not rise to the specified level of materiality or we otherwise consent to its imposition) the imposition of which could adversely affect our ability to integrate Aetna s operations with our operations, reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations after completion of the merger.  

In addition to receipt of certain governmental authorizations, completion of the merger is subject to a number of other conditions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed.  

Our obligations and the obligations of Aetna to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions in addition to receipt of certain governmental authorizations, including, among other conditions: (i) approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna shareholders at an Aetna special meeting, (ii) approval of the stock issuance by our stockholders at the CVS Health special meeting, (iii) approval for the listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of CVS Health common stock to be issued in the merger, (iv) absence of any applicable law or order that prohibits completion of the transaction, (v) accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality qualifications, (vi) performance in all material respects by the other party of the material obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the transaction, and (vii) the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party. There can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed.  

In addition, the CVS Health special meeting and the Aetna special meeting may take place before certain governmental authorizations have been obtained and, therefore, before the terms on which such governmental authorizations may be obtained, or the conditions to obtaining such governmental authorizations that may be imposed, are known. As a result, if CVS Health stockholders approve the stock issuance at the CVS Health special meeting, or Aetna shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement at the Aetna special meeting, we and Aetna may make decisions after the respective meetings to waive a condition as to the receipt of certain governmental authorizations or to take certain   

28 

Table of Contents  

actions required to obtain such governmental authorizations without seeking further stockholder or shareholder approval, as applicable, and such actions could have an adverse effect on the combined company.  

After completion of the merger, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger, which could adversely affect the value of shares of our common stock.  

The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of CVS Health and Aetna. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks, including:  

Our ability to successfully combine the businesses of CVS Health and Aetna;      

whether the combined businesses will perform as expected;      

the possibility that we paid more for Aetna than the value we will derive from the acquisition;      

the reduction of our cash available for operations and other uses and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the acquisition; and      

the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Aetna.     

If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of CVS Health and Aetna within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the value of the shares of our common stock may be adversely affected.  

We and Aetna have operated and, until completion of the merger will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key CVS Health or Aetna employees, the disruption of either company s or both companies  ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of Aetna and CVS Health in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger so the combined business performs as expected include, among other things:  

combining the companies  separate operational, financial, reporting and corporate functions;      

integrating the companies  technologies, products and services;      

identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;      

harmonizing the companies  operating practices, employee development, compensation and benefit programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;      

addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;      

consolidating the companies  corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;      

coordinating sales, distribution and marketing efforts;      

managing the movement of certain businesses and positions to different locations;      

maintaining existing agreements with customers, providers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, providers and vendors;      

operating in industry sectors in which we and our current management may have little or no experience;      

coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;      

consolidating offices of Aetna and CVS Health that are currently in or near the same location; and      

effecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.     

In addition, at times, the attention of certain members of each company s management and each company s resources may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.  

We have limited experience in the insurance and managed health care industry, which may hinder our ability to achieve the combined company s objectives.  

We have limited experience operating an insurance and managed health care business, and will rely in large part on the existing management of Aetna to continue to manage the Aetna business following the merger. However, there is no   

29 

Table of Contents  

assurance that we will be able to retain the services of such management. If we fail to retain the existing management of Aetna, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction may be adversely affected.  

We and Aetna may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger.  

As we will be operating in industry sectors for which our existing management team has little or no experience, our success after the transaction will depend in part on our ability to retain key executives and other employees of Aetna. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on CVS Health and Aetna employees may have an adverse effect on each of us and Aetna separately and consequently the combined business. This uncertainty may impair our and/or Aetna s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees of CVS Health and Aetna may experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined business.  

Additionally, Aetna s officers and employees may hold Aetna common shares, as well as Aetna stock appreciation rights, Aetna restricted stock units ( Aetna RSUs ) and Aetna performance stock units ( Aetna PSUs ) that are subject to accelerated vesting on a change in control, and, if the merger is completed, these officers and employees may be entitled to cash and/or the consideration payable under the merger agreement in respect of such Aetna common shares, stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs. These payouts could also make retention of these officers and employees more difficult. Additionally, pursuant to employment agreements and/or other agreements or arrangements with Aetna, certain key employees of Aetna are entitled to receive severance payments upon a termination without cause and/or a resignation for  good reason  following completion of the merger. Under these agreements, certain key employees of Aetna potentially could resign from his or her employment following specified circumstances set forth in his or her applicable agreement, including an adverse change in his or her title, authority or responsibilities, compensation and benefits or primary office location.  

Furthermore, if key employees of CVS Health or Aetna depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined business, we may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the business of Aetna, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger may be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees of Aetna to the same extent that Aetna has been able to attract or retain employees in the past.  

Our and Aetna s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger.  

Parties with which we or Aetna do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, Aetna or the combined business. Our and Aetna s business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, providers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, Aetna or the combined business. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of CVS Health, Aetna and/or the combined business, including a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.  

The merger agreement contains provisions that may make it more difficult for us and Aetna to pursue alternatives to the merger.  

The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Aetna to sell its business to a party other than us, or for us to sell its business. These provisions include a general prohibition on each party soliciting any acquisition proposal. Further, there are only limited exceptions to each party s agreement that its board of directors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, in the case of Aetna, or the approval of the stock issuance, in our case, and the other party generally has a right to match any acquisition proposal that may be made. However, at any time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna shareholders, in the case of Aetna, or the approval of the stock issuance by CVS Health stockholders, in our case, such party s board of directors is permitted to take certain of   

30 

Table of Contents  

these actions if it determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.  

While we believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, these restrictions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of either Aetna or CVS Health from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per-share value than the currently proposed merger consideration, in the case of Aetna, or that party were prepared to enter into an agreement that may be favorable to us or our stockholders, in our case. Furthermore, the termination fees described below may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per-share price to acquire the applicable party than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable by such party in certain circumstances.  

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.  

If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Aetna shareholders failing to approve and adopt the merger agreement or CVS Health stockholders failing to approve the stock issuance, our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:  

we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock and other securities, and from our customers, providers, vendors, regulators and employees;      

we may be required to pay Aetna a termination fee of $2.1 billion if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances;      

we will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs incurred in connection with the merger, whether or not the merger is completed;      

the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to   completion of the merger, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Aetna, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and     

matters relating to the merger (including arranging permanent financing and integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.     

There can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results, ratings, stock prices and/or bond prices.  

In addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce our obligation to perform our obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results, ratings, stock prices and/or bond prices.  

We and Aetna may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the merger from being completed. 

Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our and Aetna s respective liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from being completed, which may adversely affect our and Aetna s respective business, financial position and results of operation. Since the filing with the SEC of the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the proposed merger, a number of class action lawsuits in connection with the merger have been filed against us, Aetna and Aetna s   

31 

Table of Contents  

directors and officers. Neither we nor Aetna presently believe that there is any merit to any such lawsuit. We and Aetna intend to defend them vigorously. 

Our indebtedness following completion of the merger will be substantially greater than our indebtedness on a stand-alone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of CVS Health and Aetna existing prior to the announcement of the transaction. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility, and increase our borrowing costs. Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.  

In order to complete the merger, we expect to incur acquisition-related debt financing of approximately $45.0 billion and assume Aetna s existing indebtedness of approximately $8.2 billion. Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio following completion of the merger in comparison to that of CVS Health prior to the merger will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will increase our borrowing costs. In addition, the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service the indebtedness of CVS Health or Aetna individually prior to the merger. The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available to fund our efforts to combine our business with Aetna and realize expected benefits of the merger and/or engage in investments in product development, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels.  

In addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or, following completion of the merger, obligations to the combined company s insureds. Each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, each of Standard   Poor s and Moody s placed certain of our debt, financial strength and other credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, Standard   Poor s, A.M. Best and Fitch placed Aetna s debt, financial strength and other credit ratings under review with negative implications. Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if the merger is completed and, in certain circumstances, Aetna s debt securities are rated below investment grade, this may constitute a change of control triggering event under the indentures governing such debt. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, Aetna, as the surviving corporation of the merger, would be required to offer to repurchase most of Aetna s outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase. However, it is possible that Aetna (or us) would not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of notes or that restrictions in other debt instruments would not allow such repurchases. We cannot provide any assurance that there will be sufficient funds available for Aetna (or us) to make any required repurchases of the notes upon a change of control triggering event.  

We will incur significant transaction and integration-related costs in connection with the merger.  

We expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two companies. We will incur significant transaction costs related to the merger, including with respect to the financing for the cash consideration to be paid to Aetna shareholders. We also will incur significant integration-related fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two companies  businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.

The merger may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock.  

We currently project that the merger will result in a number of benefits, including enhanced competitive positioning and a platform from which to accelerate growth, and that it will be accretive to earnings per share in the second full year after the close of the transaction. This projection is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, future events and conditions could decrease or delay the accretion that is currently projected or could result in dilution, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration-related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger. Any dilution of, decrease in or delay of any accretion to, our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.  

The future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following completion of the merger.  

Following completion of the merger, the size of the combined company s business will be significantly larger than the current size of either our or Aetna s respective businesses. The combined company s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management s ability to implement an effective integration of the two companies and its ability to manage a combined business with significantly larger size and scope with the associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the management of the combined company will be successful or that the combined company will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.  

Additional information concerning these risks, uncertainties and assumptions can be found in the section entitled  Risk Factors  beginning on page 62 of our preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus filed February 9, 2018 with the SEC on Form S-4/A.

PART II   

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.   

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  CVS.  The table below sets forth the high and low closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the quarterly cash dividends declared per share of common stock during the periods indicated. 

CVS Health has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Company s Board of Directors. As of February 9, 2018, there were 21,453 registered shareholders according to the records maintained by our transfer agent. 

The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2016 Repurchase Program can be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. 

Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, in August 2016, the Company entered into two fixed dollar ASRs with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ) for a total of $3.6 billion. Upon payment of the $3.6 billion purchase price in January 2017, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to 80% of the $3.6 billion notional amount of the ASRs or approximately 36.1 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2017. The ASRs were accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $2.9 billion and a forward contract for $0.7 billion. In April 2017, the Company received 9.9 million shares of common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $3.6 billion notional amount of the ASRs, thereby concluding the ASRs. The remaining 9.9 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in April 2017. 

In the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude the ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 55.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $4.4 billion under the 2014 and 2016 Repurchase Programs. As of December 31, 2017, there remained an aggregate of approximately $13.9 billion available for future repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program and the 2014 Repurchase Program was complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company suspended share repurchase activity in connection with the Aetna Acquisition.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements that are included in this Annual Report. 

Overview of Our Business 

CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively,  CVS Health,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ), is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health. At the forefront of a changing health care landscape, the Company has an unmatched suite of capabilities and the expertise needed to drive innovations that will help shape the future of health care. 

We are currently the only integrated pharmacy health care company with the ability to impact consumers, payors, and providers with innovative, channel-agnostic solutions. We have a deep understanding of their diverse needs through our unique integrated model, and we are bringing them innovative solutions that help increase access to quality care, deliver better health outcomes and lower overall health care costs. 

Through more than 9,800 retail locations, more than 1,100 walk-in health care clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with more than 94 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year, expanding specialty pharmacy services and a leading stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, we enable people, businesses, and communities to manage health in more affordable, effective ways. We are delivering break-through products and services, from advising patients on their medications at our CVS Pharmacy      locations, to introducing unique programs to help control costs for our clients at CVS Caremark     , to innovating how care is delivered to our patients with complex conditions through CVS Specialty     , to improving pharmacy care for the senior community through Omnicare     , or by expanding access to high-quality, low-cost care at CVS MinuteClinic     . 

We have three reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. 

Overview of Our Pharmacy Services Segment 

Our Pharmacy Services business generates revenue from a full range of pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. 

Our clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part D plans, Managed Medicaid plans, plans offered on the public and private exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States. A portion of covered lives primarily within the Managed Medicaid, health plan and employer markets have access to our services through public and private exchanges. 

As a pharmacy benefits manager, we manage the dispensing of prescription drugs through our mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, national network of long-term care pharmacies and more than 68,000 retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately 41,000 chain pharmacies (which includes our CVS Pharmacy      pharmacies) and 27,000 independent pharmacies, to eligible members in the benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems to perform, among other things, safety checks, drug interaction screenings and brand-to-generic substitutions. 

Our specialty pharmacies support individuals who require complex and expensive drug therapies. Our specialty pharmacy business includes mail order and retail specialty pharmacies that operate under the CVS Caremark     , Navarro      Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts ( ACS Pharmacy ) names. Substantially all of our mail service specialty pharmacies have been accredited by The Joint Commission, which is an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies health care organizations and programs in the United States. We also offer specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition services through Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ). With Specialty Connect     , which integrates our specialty pharmacy mail and retail capabilities, we provide members with disease-state specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to   

1 

any CVS Pharmacy location. Whether submitted through one of our mail order pharmacy or at a CVS Pharmacy, all prescriptions are filled through the Company s specialty mail order pharmacies, so all revenue from this specialty prescription services program is recorded within the Pharmacy Services Segment. Members then can choose to pick up their medication at their local CVS Pharmacy or have it sent to their home through the mail. 

We also provide health management programs, which include integrated disease management for 18 conditions, through our AccordantCare  TM   rare disease management offering. The majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. 

In addition, through our SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. As of December 31, 2017, we provided Medicare Part D plan benefits to approximately 5.5 million beneficiaries through SilverScript, including our individual and employer group waiver plans. 

The Pharmacy Services Segment operates under the CVS Caremark      Pharmacy Services, Caremark     , CVS Caremark     , CVS Specialty     , AccordantCare  TM  , SilverScript     , Wellpartner     , Coram     , NovoLogix     , Navarro      Health Services and ACS Pharmacy names. As of December 31, 2017, the Pharmacy Services Segment operated 23 retail specialty pharmacy stores, 18 specialty mail order pharmacies, four mail order dispensing pharmacies, and 83 branches for infusion and enteral services, including approximately 73 ambulatory infusion suites and three centers of excellence, located in 42 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. 

Overview of Our Retail/LTC Segment 

Our Retail/LTC Segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, personal care products, convenience foods, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise and greeting cards. With the acquisition of Omnicare s long-term care ( LTC ) operations, the Retail/LTC Segment now also includes the distribution of prescription drugs, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. Omnicare operations also included commercialization services which were provided under the name RxCrossroads       ( RxC ), until the sale of RxC was completed on January 2, 2018. See Note 3  Goodwill and Other Intangibles  to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Our Retail/LTC Segment derives the majority of its revenues through the sale of prescription drugs, which are dispensed by our more than 32,000 pharmacists. The role of our retail pharmacists is expanding from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services, including flu vaccinations as well as face-to-face patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies, closing gaps in care, and more cost-effective drug therapies. Our integrated pharmacy services model enables us to enhance access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes. 

Our Retail/LTC Segment also provides health care services through our MinuteClinic      health care clinics. MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions, and deliver vaccinations. We believe our clinics provide high quality services that are affordable and convenient. 

Our proprietary loyalty card program, ExtraCare     , has about 62 million active cardholders, making it one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty card programs in the country. 

As of December 31, 2017, our Retail/LTC Segment included 9,803 retail stores (of which 8,060 were our stores that operated a pharmacy and 1,695 were our pharmacies located within Target stores) located in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy     , CVS     , CVS Pharmacy y m s     , Longs Drugs     , Navarro Discount Pharmacy      and Drogaria Onofre  TM   names, 37 onsite pharmacies primarily operating under the CarePlus CVS Pharmacy  TM  , CarePlus      and CVS Pharmacy      names, and 1,134 retail health care clinics operating under the MinuteClinic      name (of which 1,129 were located in our retail pharmacy stores or Target stores), and our online retail websites, CVS.com     , Navarro.com  TM   and Onofre.com.br  TM  . LTC operations are comprised of 145 spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders, of which 30 are also hub pharmacies that use proprietary automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC operates primarily under the Omnicare      and NeighborCare      names.

Overview of Our Corporate Segment 

The Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of our executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments. 

Proposed Acquisition of Aetna 

On December 3, 2017, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Aetna Inc. ( Aetna ) for a combination of cash and stock ( Aetna Acquisition ). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Aetna shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. The transaction values Aetna at approximately $207 per share or approximately $69 billion based on the Company s 5-day volume weighted average price ending December 1, 2017 of $74.21 per share. Including the assumption of Aetna s debt, the total value of the transaction is approximately $77 billion. The final purchase price will be determined based on the Company s stock price on the date of closing of the transaction. We expect to finance the cash portion of the purchase price through a combination of cash on hand and by issuing approximately $45.0 billion of new debt, including senior notes and term loans (see  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ). We made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement, including, among others, a covenant, subject to certain exceptions, to conduct our business in the ordinary course between the execution of the merger agreement and the closing of the transaction. 

The proposed acquisition is currently projected to close in the second half of 2018 and remains subject to approval by CVS Health and Aetna shareholders and customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the waiting period under the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and approvals of state departments of insurance and U.S. and international regulators. 

If the transaction is not completed, the Company could be liable to Aetna for a termination fee of $2.1 billion in connection with the merger agreement, depending on the reasons leading to such termination. 

Results of Operations 

Summary of our Consolidated Financial Results 

3 

Net revenues   increased $7.2 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased $24.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. As you review our performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information: 

During 2017, net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased 8.9% and net revenues in our Retail/LTC Segment decreased 2.1% compared to the prior year. The Retail/LTC Segment decrease was primarily due to a decline in same store sales of 2.6% as a result of the previously-announced marketplace changes that restrict CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks.     

During 2016, net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased by 19.5% and net revenues in our Retail/LTC Segment increased 12.6% compared to the prior year. The Retail/LTC Segment benefited from the 2015 acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.     

In 2017 and 2016, the Pharmacy Services Segment continued to grow from net new business and specialty. The increase in our generic dispensing rates in both of our operating segments continued to have a negative effect on net revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016, as well as in 2016 as compared to 2015.     

Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about our net revenues. 

Gross profit   decreased $312 million, or 1.1% in 2017, to $28.5 billion, as compared to $28.9 billion in 2016. Gross profit increased $2.3 billion, or 8.8% in 2016, to $28.9 billion, as compared to $26.5 billion in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined to 15.4%, as compared to 16.3% in 2016 and 17.3% in 2015. 

During 2017, gross profit in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment increased by 2.4% and decreased by 1.8%, respectively, compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment was 4.6% and 29.4%, respectively.     

During 2016, gross profit in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment increased by 12.9% and 7.9%, respectively, compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment was 4.9% and 29.3%, respectively.     

The increased weighting toward the Pharmacy Services Segment, which has a lower gross margin than the Retail/LTC Segment, resulted in a decline in consolidated gross profit as a percent of net revenues in 2017 as compared to 2016. In addition, gross profit for 2017 and 2016 has been negatively impacted by price compression in the Pharmacy Services Segment and reimbursement pressure in the Retail/LTC Segment.     

Our gross profit continued to benefit from the increased utilization of generic drugs, which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than brand name drugs, in both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments for 2017 and 2016, partially offsetting the negative impacts described above.     

Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about our gross profit. 

Operating expenses   increased $537 million, or 2.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenues declined to 10.3% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 10.4% in the prior year. The increase in operating expense dollars in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in charges of $181 million associated with the closure of 71 retail stores in connection with our enterprise streamlining initiative, goodwill impairment charges of $181 million related to the RxCrossroads reporting unit within the Retail/LTC Segment, $57 million of hurricane related expenses which were predominately in the Retail/LTC Segment, and new store openings. The increase in operating expenses also reflects the lack of a favorable impact for the reversal of an accrual of $85 million, in the Pharmacy Services Segment, in connection with a legal settlement in the year ended December 31, 2016. These matters which led to the increase in operating expenses in 2017 were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $226 million due to the bulk of the Omnicare related integration costs being incurred in 2016. The improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 is primarily due to expense leverage from net revenue growth.

Operating expenses increased $1.4 billion, or 8.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenues declined to 10.4% in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 11.1% in the prior year. The increase in operating expense dollars in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of the Target pharmacy and clinic businesses in December 2015, the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015 and incremental store operating costs associated with a higher store count, partially offset by lower legal settlement costs, including the reversal of an accrual of $85 million, in the Pharmacy Services Segment, in the year ended December 31, 2016. The improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 was primarily due to expense leverage from net revenue growth. 

Please see the Segment Analysis later in this document for additional information about operating expenses. 

Interest expense, net   for the years ended December 31 consisted of the following: 

Net interest expense decreased $17 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the Company s debt issuance and debt tender offers that occurred in 2016 which resulted in overall more favorable interest rates on the Company s long-term debt. See Note 5  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. During 2016, net interest expense increased $220 million, primarily due to the $15 billion debt issuance in July 2015, the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target, and repay the majority of the debt assumed in the Omnicare acquisition.  

Loss on early extinguishment of debt   - During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company purchased approximately $4.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain of its senior notes pursuant to its tender offer for such senior notes and option to redeem the outstanding senior notes (see Note 5  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements). The Company paid a premium of $583 million in excess of the debt principal, wrote off $54 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $6 million in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $643 million. 

Income tax provision   - On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  TCJA ). Among numerous changes to existing tax laws, the TCJA permanently reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax balances are required to be taken into consideration in the period in which the changes are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. As the result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate under the TCJA, the Company estimated the revaluation of its net deferred tax liabilities and recorded a provisional noncash income tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion for year ended December 31, 2017. The Company has not completed all of its processes to determine the TCJA s final impact. The final impact may differ from this provisional amount due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made thus far and the issuance of additional regulatory or other guidance. The accounting is expected to be completed by the time the 2017 federal corporate income tax return is filed in 2018. 

Our effective income tax rate was 19.8%, 38.4% and 39.3% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the provisional impact of the TCJA, including the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the resolution in 2016 of certain income tax matters in tax years through 2012, as well as other permanent items.  

Income (loss) from discontinued operations -   In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens  n Things, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and Bob s stores, which filed for bankruptcy in 2016. The Company s loss from discontinued operations includes lease-related costs required to satisfy its Linens  n Things and Bob s Stores lease guarantees. We incurred a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $8 million and $1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company s income from discontinued operations in 2015 of $9 million, net of tax, was related to the release of certain store lease guarantees due to the settlement of a dispute with a landlord.

See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies - Discontinued Operations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about discontinued operations and Note 12  Commitments and Contingencies  for additional information about our lease guarantees. 

Segment Analysis 

We evaluate the performance of our Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments based on net revenues, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate Segment based on operating expenses before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains, and certain intersegment activities. The following is a reconciliation of the Company s business segments to the consolidated financial statements: 

(1) 

Net revenues of the Pharmacy Services Segment include approximately $10.8 billion, $10.5 billion and $8.9 billion of Retail/LTC Co-Payments for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Retail/LTC Co-Payments.     

(2) 

Intersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services Segment and the Retail/LTC Segment. These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients ( members ) fill prescriptions at our retail pharmacies to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice       elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of our retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at our long-term care pharmacies. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis.     

(3) 

The Retail/LTC Segment gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, includes $2 million and $46 million, respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs. The integration costs in 2017 are related to the acquisition of Omnicare and the integration costs in 2016 are related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.     

(4) 

The Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for 2017, 2016 and 2015, include $34 million, $281 million and $64 million, respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs. The integration costs in 2017 are related to the acquisition of Omnicare. The integration costs in 2016 and 2015 are related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes $215 million of charges associated with store rationalization and $181 million of goodwill impairment charges related to the RxCrossroads reporting unit. For the year ended December 31, 2016, operating profit includes a $34 million asset impairment charge in connection with planned store closures in 2017 related to our enterprise streamlining initiative.     

(5) 

The Corporate Segment operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, includes a reduction of $3 million in integration costs for a change in estimate related to the acquisition of Omnicare, $34 million in acquisition-related transaction costs related to the proposed Aetna acquisition and $9 million of transaction costs related to the divestiture of RxCrossroads. The Corporate Segment operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes integration costs of $10 million related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Corporate Segment operating loss includes $156 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target and a $90 million charge related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 legal settlement by MedPartners of various securities class actions and a related derivative claim.     

(6) 

The Pharmacy Services Segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, includes the reversal of an accrual of $88 million in connection with a legal settlement.     

(7) 

Amounts revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07,   Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost  , which increased consolidated operating profit by $28 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Pharmacy Services Segment 

The following table summarizes our Pharmacy Services Segment s performance for the respective periods: 

(1) 

Amounts revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07,   Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost  , which decreased operating expenses and increased operating profit by $4 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     

(2) 

The Pharmacy Services Segment operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, includes the reversal of an accrual of $88 million in connection with a legal settlement.     

(3) 

Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail facility, which includes specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect       claims picked up at retail, as well as prescriptions filled at our retail pharmacies under the Maintenance Choice      program.     

(4) 

Pharmacy network net revenues, claims processed and generic dispensing rates do not include Maintenance Choice activity, which is included within the mail choice category. Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including our retail pharmacies and long-term care pharmacies, but excluding Maintenance Choice activity.     

(5) 

Includes the adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.     

(6) 

The pharmacy claims processed, the generic dispensing rate and the mail choice penetration rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, has been revised to reflect 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions.     

Net revenues   in our Pharmacy Services Segment increased $10.6 billion, or 8.9%, to $130.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to growth in pharmacy network and specialty pharmacy volume as well as brand inflation, partially offset by continued price compression and increased generic dispensing. 

Net revenues increased $19.6 billion, or 19.5%, to $120.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased pharmacy network claims, growth in specialty pharmacy, growth in Medicare Part D, addition of ACS Pharmacy through the acquisition of Omnicare, and inflation, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression. 

As you review our Pharmacy Services Segment s revenue performance, we believe you should also consider the following important information about the business: 

7 

were driven by growth in specialty pharmacy claims, an increase in net new business, and continued adoption of our Maintenance Choice offerings.      

During 2017 and 2016, our average revenue per pharmacy network claim processed remained flat on a 30-day equivalent basis.     

Our mail choice generic dispensing rate was 83.1%, 81.4% and 79.4% in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our pharmacy network generic dispensing rate was 87.7%, 86.7%, and 84.9% in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These continued increases in mail choice and pharmacy network generic dispensing rates were primarily due to the impact of new generic drug introductions, and our continuous efforts to encourage plan members to use generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate. We believe our generic dispensing rates will continue to increase in future periods, albeit at a slower pace. This increase will be affected by, among other things, the number of new brand and generic drug introductions and our success at encouraging plan members to utilize generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate.     

Gross profit   in our Pharmacy Services Segment includes net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues includes (i) the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed, either directly through our mail service and specialty retail pharmacies or indirectly through our pharmacy network, (ii) shipping and handling costs and (iii) the operating costs of our mail service dispensing pharmacies, customer service operations and related information technology support. 

Gross profit increased $139 million, or 2.4%, to $6.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.9% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, higher generic dispensing and favorable purchasing economics, partially offset by price compression. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to changes in the mix of our business and continued price compression, partially offset by favorable generic dispensing and purchasing economics. 

Gross profit increased $674 million, or 12.9%, to $5.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 5.2% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit dollars in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, growth in Medicare Part D lives, higher generic dispensing and favorable purchasing economics, partially offset by price compression. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to changes in the mix of our business and continued price compression, partially offset by favorable generic dispensing and purchasing economics. 

As you review our Pharmacy Services Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information about the business: 

Our efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates and/or discounts we received from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on our gross profit dollars and gross profit as a percentage of net revenues. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused us and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, market dynamics and regulatory changes have limited our      

8 

ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network  differential  or  spread,  and we expect these trends to continue. The  differential  or  spread  is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.     

Operating expenses   in our Pharmacy Services Segment, which include selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization related to selling, general and administrative activities and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs, were flat at 1.0% of net revenues in 2017 and 2016, compared to 1.2% in 2015. 

Operating expenses increased $60 million or 4.9% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year. Operating expenses decreased $10 million or 0.8% in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year. These changes in operating expense dollars are primarily due to an $88 million reversal of an accrual in connection with a legal settlement in 2016, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the growth of our business. 

Retail/LTC Segment 

The following table summarizes our Retail/LTC Segment s performance for the respective periods: 

(1) 

Gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, includes $2 million and $46 million, respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs. In 2017, the integration costs related to the acquisition of Omnicare. In 2016, the integration costs related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.     

(2) 

Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, include $32 million, $235 million and $64 million, respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs. In 2017, the integration costs related to the acquisition of Omnicare. In 2016 and 2015, the integration costs related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating expenses include $215 million of charges associated with store closures and $181 million of goodwill impairment charges related to the segment s RxCrossroads reporting unit. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, also include a $34 million asset impairment charge in connection with planned store closures in 2017 related to our enterprise streamlining initiative.     

(3) 

Amounts revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07,   Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost  , which decreased operating expenses and increased operating profit by $21 million and $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     

(4) 

Includes the adjustment to convert 90 day, non-specialty prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30 day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.     

(5) 

Same store sales and prescriptions exclude revenues from MinuteClinic, and revenue and prescriptions from stores in Brazil, from LTC operations and from commercialization services.     

(6) 

Front store same store sales would have been approximately 520 basis points higher for the year ended December 31, 2015, if tobacco and the estimated associated basket sales were excluded from the year ended December 31, 2014.     

9 

Net revenues   decreased approximately $1.7 billion, or 2.1%, to $79.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in same store sales as a result of the previously-announced marketplace changes that restrict CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks. 

Net revenues increased approximately $9.1 billion, or 12.6%, to $81.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisitions of the pharmacies and clinics of Target and new stores, which accounted for approximately 640 basis points of our total net revenue percentage increase during the year, the acquisition of Omnicare s LTC operations and a same store sales increase of 1.9%. As you review our Retail/LTC Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information about the business: 

Front store same store sales declined 2.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, and were negatively impacted approximately 30 basis points due to the absence of leap day in the current year. The decrease is primarily driven by softer customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, partially offset by an increase in basket size.     

Pharmacy same store sales declined 2.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 390 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Same store prescription volumes increased 0.4%, including the approximately 420 basis point negative impact from previously-discussed marketplace changes that restrict CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks that had an.      

Pharmacy revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the conversion of brand name drugs to equivalent generic drugs, which typically have a lower selling price. The generic dispensing rate grew to 87.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 85.7% in the prior year. In addition, our pharmacy revenue growth has also been negatively affected by the mix of drugs sold, continued reimbursement pressure and the lack of significant new brand name drug introductions.     

Pharmacy revenue growth may be impacted by industry changes in the LTC business, such as continuing lower occupancy rates at skilled nursing facilities.      

Pharmacy revenue continued to benefit from our ability to attract and retain managed care customers, the increased use of pharmaceuticals by an aging population and as the first line of defense for health care.     

Gross profit   in our Retail/LTC Segment includes net revenues less the cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period and the related purchasing costs, warehousing costs, delivery costs and actual and estimated inventory losses. 

Gross profit decreased $421 million, or 1.8%, to approximately $23.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly to 29.4% in year ended December 31, 2017, from 29.3% in 2016. Gross profit increased $1.7 billion, or 7.9%, to approximately $23.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 29.3% in year ended December 31, 2016, from 30.5% in 2015. 

The decrease in gross profit dollars in both Retail Pharmacy and LTC in the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily driven by the continued reimbursement pressure as well as a loss of prescriptions in Retail Pharmacy due to previously discussed network restrictions. In the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was relatively flat driven by increased front store margins which offset the continued reimbursement pressure on pharmacy. Front store margins increased due to changes in the mix of products sold and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies. 

As you review our Retail/LTC Segment s performance in this area, we believe you should consider the following important information about the business: 

10 

gross profit on front store revenues is higher than our gross profit on pharmacy revenues. The mix effect from a higher proportion of pharmacy sales had a negative effect on our overall gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. This negative effect was partially offset by an increase in generic drugs dispensed, and an improved front store gross margin rate, which includes efforts to rationalize promotional strategies.     

During 2017 and 2016, our front store gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased compared to the prior year. In both years, the increase reflects a change in the mix of products sold, including store brand products, as a result of our efforts to rationalize promotional strategies.      

Our pharmacy gross profit rates have been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of our business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC Segment. In the event the reimbursement pressure accelerates, we may not be able to grow our revenues and gross profit dollars could be adversely impacted. The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted our gross profit but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which we expect to continue, reduces the benefit we realize from brand to generic product conversions.     

Operating expenses   in our Retail/LTC Segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses. 

Operating expenses increased $412 million, or 2.5% to $16.8 billion, or 21.2% as a percentage of net revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $16.4 billion, or 20.3% as a percentage of net revenues, in the prior year. Operating expenses increased $1.6 billion, or 10.7%, to $16.4 billion, or 20.3% as a percentage of net revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $14.9 billion, or 20.6% as a percentage of net revenues, in the prior year.  

The increase in operating expense dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to $181 million increase in charges associated with the closure of 71 retail stores in connection with our enterprise streamlining initiative, $181 million of goodwill impairment charges related to the RxCrossroads reporting unit, which was subsequently sold on January 2, 2018, $55 million in hurricane related costs, and new store openings. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased due to a decline in expense leverage with the loss of business from restricted network changes.  

The increase in operating expense dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the 2015 acquisitions of LTC and the pharmacies and clinics within Target stores, including acquisition-related integration costs of $235 million, as well as incremental store operating costs associated with operating more stores. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, includes a gain from a legal settlement with certain credit card companies of $32 million and an asset impairment charge of $34 million in connection with planned store closures in 2017 related to our enterprise streamlining initiative. Additionally, in April 2016, the Retail/LTC Segment made a charitable contribution of $32 million to the CVS Foundation to fund future charitable giving. The CVS Foundation is a non-profit entity that focuses on health, education and community involvement programs. The charitable contribution was recorded as an operating expense in the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Corporate Segment 

Operating expenses   increased $75 million, or 8.4%, to $966 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses decreased $144 million, or 13.9%, to $891 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating expenses within the Corporate Segment include executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance related costs. The increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, was partially driven by ongoing investments in strategic initiatives and increased employee benefit costs. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, include $34 million in transaction costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Aetna, $9 million of transaction costs associated with the divestiture of RxCrossroads. The decrease in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to   

11 

acquisition-related transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Omnicare that occurred in August 2015, and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target that occurred in December 2015.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to meet our cash needs in the short-term. Over the long-term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. We believe our operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, sale-leaseback program, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. 

The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 

Net cash provided by operating activities   decreased by $2.1 billion in 2017 and increased by $1.6 billion in 2016. These changes are primarily related to the timing of payments for our Medicare Part D operations.  

Net cash used in investing activities   increased by $462 million in 2017 and decreased $11.0 billion in 2016. The increase in 2017 is largely driven by an increase in acquisition activity as compared to 2016. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the $9.6 billion paid for the acquisition of Omnicare and the $1.9 billion paid for the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target in 2015, compared to the $539 million paid for acquisitions in 2016. 

In 2017, gross capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.9 billion, a decrease of approximately $306 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2017 capital expenditures is due to the Target integration being completed in 2016. During 2017, approximately 25% of our total capital expenditures were for new store construction, 30% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements and 45% were for technology and other corporate initiatives. Gross capital expenditures totaled approximately $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion during 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016, approximately 31% of our total capital expenditures were for new store construction, 20% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements and 49% were for technology and other corporate initiatives. 

Proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions totaled $265 million in 2017. This compares to $230 million in 2016 and $411 million in 2015. Under the sale-leaseback transactions, the properties are generally sold at net book value, which generally approximates fair value, and the resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. The specific timing and amount of future sale-leaseback transactions will vary depending on future market conditions and other factors. 

Below is a summary of our store development activity for the respective years: 

(1) 

Relocated stores are not included in new or closed store totals.     

(2) 

Includes retail drugstores, certain onsite pharmacy stores, specialty pharmacy stores and pharmacies within Target stores.     

12 

Net cash used in financing activities     was $6.8 billion in both 2017 and 2016 as net borrowings and net payments to shareholders were relatively flat in both years. Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.9 billion in 2015 versus net cash used in financing activities of $6.8 billion in 2016. The difference of $11.6 billion was primarily due to higher net borrowings in 2015, including the $14.8 billion in net proceeds received from the July 2015 debt issuance that was used to fund the acquisition of Omnicare and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. 

Share repurchase programs     The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2016 Repurchase Program can be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. 

Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, in August 2016, the Company entered into two fixed dollar ASRs with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ) for a total of $3.6 billion. Upon payment of the $3.6 billion purchase price in January 2017, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to 80% of the $3.6 billion notional amount of the ASRs or approximately 36.1 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2017. The ASRs were accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $2.9 billion and a forward contract for $0.7 billion. In April 2017, the Company received 9.9 million shares of common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $3.6 billion notional amount of the ASRs, thereby concluding the ASRs. The remaining 9.9 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in April 2017. 

Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, in December 2015, the Company entered into a $725 million fixed dollar ASR with Barclays. Upon payment of the $725 million purchase price in December 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to 80% of the $725 million notional amount of the ASR or approximately 6.2 million shares. The initial 6.2 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in December 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of $580 million and a forward contract of $145 million. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet. In January 2016, the Company received 1.4 million shares of common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $725 million notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining 1.4 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in January 2016 and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock. 

Pursuant to the authorization under the 2013 Repurchase Programs, in January 2015, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar ASR agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( JP Morgan ). Upon payment of the $2.0 billion purchase price in January 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to 80% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately 16.8 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2015. In May 2015, the Company received approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining 3.1 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by JP Morgan were placed into treasury stock in May 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of $1.6 billion and a forward contract of $0.4 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was initially recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet and was reclassified to treasury stock upon the settlement of the ASR in May 2015. 

13 

In the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude the ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 55.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $4.4 billion under the 2014 and 2016 Repurchase Programs.

The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately 0.02%, regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the back-up credit facilities. During 2018, the Company intends to refinance the 364-day unsecured back-up credit facility, which expires on May 17, 2018. 

On December 3, 2017, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Aetna, the Company entered into a $49.0 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. The Company paid approximately $221 million in fees upon entering into the agreement. The fees were capitalized in other current assets and will be amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility is outstanding. The bridge loan facility was reduced to $44.0 billion on December 15, 2017 upon the Company entering into a $5.0 billion term loan agreement. The Company recorded $56 million of amortization of the bridge loan facility fees during the year ended December 31, 2017, which was recorded in interest expense. On December 15, 2017, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Aetna, the Company entered into a $5.0 billion unsecured term loan agreement. The term loan facility under the term loan agreement consists of a $3.0 billion three-year tranche and a $2.0 billion five-year tranche. The term loan facility allows for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly commitment fee, regardless of usage.

The Company terminated the credit facility in May 2017. 

On May 20, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Omnicare, the Company entered into a $13 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. The Company paid approximately $52 million in fees in connection with the facility. The fees were capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility was outstanding. The bridge loan facility expired on July 20, 2015 upon the Company s issuance of unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal of $15 billion as discussed below. The bridge loan facility fees became fully amortized in July 2015. 

14 

Long-term borrowings   - On May 16, 2016, the Company issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.125% unsecured senior notes due June 1, 2021 and $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.875% unsecured senior notes due June 1, 2026 (collectively, the  2016 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2016 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company s option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repay certain corporate debt. 

On May 16, 2016, the Company announced tender offers for (1) any and all of its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2017, its 6.60% Senior Notes due 2019 and its 4.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (collectively, the  Any and All Notes ) and (2) up to $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2027, its 6.125% Senior Notes due 2039, its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2041, the 5.00% Senior Notes due 2024 issued by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ), the 4.75% Senior Notes due 2022 issued by Omnicare, its 4.875% Senior Notes due 2035 and its 3.875% Senior Notes due 2025 (collectively, the  Maximum Tender Offer Notes  and together with the Any and All Notes, the  Notes ). On May 31, 2016, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the tender offers for the Maximum Tender Offer Notes to $2.25 billion. The Company purchased approximately $835 million aggregate principal amount of the Any and All Notes and $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the Maximum Tender Offer Notes pursuant to the tender offers, which expired on June 13, 2016. The Company paid a premium of $486 million in excess of the debt principal in connection with the purchase of the Notes, wrote off $50 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $6 million in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $542 million which was recorded in income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

On June 27, 2016, the Company notified the holders of the remaining Any and All Notes that the Company was exercising its option to redeem the outstanding Any and All Notes pursuant to the terms of the Any and All Notes and the Indenture dated as of August 15, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. Approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Any and All Notes was redeemed on July 27, 2016. The Company paid a premium of $97 million in excess of the debt principal and wrote off $4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $101 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. 

The Company recorded a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $643 million which was recorded in the income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

On July 20, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of $2.25 billion of 1.9% unsecured senior notes due 2018 ( 2018 Notes ), an aggregate of $2.75 billion of 2.8% unsecured senior notes due 2020 ( 2020 Notes ), an aggregate of $1.5 billion of 3.5% unsecured senior notes due 2022 ( 2022 Notes ), an aggregate of $3 billion of 3.875% unsecured senior notes due 2025 ( 2025 Notes ), an aggregate of $2 billion of 4.875% unsecured senior notes due 2035 ( 2035 Notes ), and an aggregate of $3.5 billion of 5.125% unsecured senior notes due 2045 ( 2045 Notes  and, together with the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2035 Notes, the  Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately $14.8 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The Notes pay interest semi-annually and contain redemption terms which allow or require the Company to redeem the Notes at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest at the redemption date. The net proceeds of the Notes were used to fund the Omnicare acquisition and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 

Upon the closing of the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015, the Company assumed the long-term debt of Omnicare that had a fair value of approximately $3.1 billion, $2.0 billion of which was previously convertible into Omnicare shares that holders were able to redeem subsequent to the acquisition. During the period from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015, all but $5 million of the $2.0 billion of previously convertible debt was redeemed and repaid and approximately $0.4 billion in Omnicare term debt assumed was repaid for total repayments of Omnicare debt of approximately $2.4 billion in 2015. 

The remaining principal of the Omnicare debt assumed was comprised of senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $700 million ($400 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2022 and $300 million of 5% senior notes due 2024). In September 2015, the Company commenced exchange offers for the 4.75% senior notes due 2022 and the 5%   

15 

senior notes due 2024 to exchange all validly tendered and accepted notes issued by Omnicare for notes to be issued by the Company. This offer expired on October 20, 2015 and the aggregate principal amounts of $388 million of the 4.75% senior notes due 2022 and $296 million of the 5% senior notes due 2024 were validly tendered and exchanged for notes issued by the Company. The Company recorded this exchange transaction as a modification of the original debt instruments. Consequently, no gain or loss on extinguishment was recognized in the Company s consolidated income statement as a result of this exchange transaction and the issuance costs of the new debt were expensed as incurred. 

Our back-up credit facilities and unsecured senior notes (see Note 5  Borrowings and Credit Agreements  to the consolidated financial statements) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. The covenants do not materially affect the Company s financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2017, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. 

As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding derivative financial instruments (see Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements). We had no outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2016. 

Debt Ratings   - As of December 31, 2017, our long-term debt was rated  Baa1  by Moody s and  BBB+  by Standard   Poor s, and our commercial paper program was rated  P 2  by Moody s and  A 2  by Standard   Poor s. In December 2017, subsequent to the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Aetna, Moody s changed the outlook on our long-term debt to  Under Review  from  Stable.  Similarly, S P placed our-long-term debt outlook on  Watch Negative  from  Stable . The outlook for the commercial paper program was unchanged. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody s and Standard   Poor s considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information. Although we currently believe our long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, we cannot guarantee the future actions of Moody s and/or Standard   Poor s. Our debt ratings have a direct impact on our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. 

Quarterly Cash Dividend   - In December 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an 18% increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.50 per share effective in 2017. This increase equated to an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share. The Company expects to maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share throughout 2018. In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a 21% increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.425 per share. This increase equated to an annual dividend rate of $1.70 per share. In December 2014, our Board of directors authorized a 27% increase to our quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.35 per share. This increase equated to an annual dividend rate of $1.40 per share. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In connection with executing operating leases, we provide a guarantee of the lease payments. We also finance a portion of our new store development through sale-leaseback transactions, which involve selling stores to unrelated parties and then leasing the stores back under leases that generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. We do not have any retained or contingent interests in the stores, and we do not provide any guarantees, other than a guarantee of the lease payments, in connection with the transactions. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our operating leases are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Between 1995 and 1997, we sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob s Stores, Linens  n Things, and Marshalls. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the store s lease obligations. When the subsidiaries were disposed of, the Company s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser agreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries were to become insolvent and failed to make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy these obligations. 

As of December 31, 2017, we guaranteed approximately 85 such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens  n Things), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2029. Management believes the ultimate disposition of any of the remaining lease guarantees will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or future cash flows. Please see  Income (loss) from discontinued operations

The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target Corporation ( Target ). See Note 7  Leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the lease arrangements with Target. Amounts related to the operating and capital leases with Target are reflected within the operating leases and capital lease obligations above. Amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic lives of the buildings are reflected herein assuming equivalent stores continue to operate through the term of the arrangements.     

(2) 

Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated on outstanding balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2017.     

Critical Accounting Policies 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered, support the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. 

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies  to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them. 

Revenue Recognition 

Pharmacy Services Segment 

Our Pharmacy Services Segment sells prescription drugs directly through our mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through our retail pharmacy network. We recognize revenues in our Pharmacy Services Segment from prescription drugs sold by our mail service dispensing pharmacies and under retail pharmacy network contracts where we are the principal using the gross method at the contract prices negotiated with our clients. Net revenue from our Pharmacy Services Segment includes: (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to us, net of any volume-related or other discounts paid back to the client, (ii) the price paid to us ( Mail Co-Payments ) or a third party pharmacy in our retail pharmacy network ( Retail Co-Payments ) by individuals included in our clients  benefit plans, and (iii) administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts where we are not the principal. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 

We recognize revenue in the Pharmacy Services Segment when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and   

17 

(iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Pharmacy Services Segment. 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription is delivered. At the time of delivery, the Pharmacy Services Segment has performed substantially all of its obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.     

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Pharmacy Services Segment s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Pharmacy Services Segment s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Pharmacy Services Segment s online claims processing system.     

We determine whether we are the principal or agent for our retail pharmacy network transactions on a contract by contract basis. In the majority of our contracts, we have determined we are the principal due to us: (i) being the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) having latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) having discretion in supplier selection, (iv) having involvement in the determination of product or service specifications, and (v) having credit risk. Our obligations under our client contracts for which revenues are reported using the gross method are separate and distinct from our obligations to the third party pharmacies included in our retail pharmacy network contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, we are contractually required to pay the third party pharmacies in our retail pharmacy network for products sold, regardless of whether we are paid by our clients. Our responsibilities under these client contracts typically include validating eligibility and coverage levels, communicating the prescription price and the co-payments due to the third party retail pharmacy, identifying possible adverse drug interactions for the pharmacist to address with the physician prior to dispensing, suggesting clinically appropriate generic alternatives where appropriate and approving the prescription for dispensing. Although we do not have credit risk with respect to Retail Co-Payments or inventory risk related to retail network claims, we believe that all of the other indicators of gross revenue reporting are present. For contracts under which we act as an agent, we record revenues using the net method. 

We deduct from our revenues the manufacturers  rebates that are earned by our clients based on their members  utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. We estimate these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and our estimates of the manufacturers  rebates earned by our clients. We base our estimates on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. We adjust our rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. We record any cumulative effect of these adjustments against revenues as identified, and adjust our estimates prospectively to consider recurring matters. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with our clients or manufacturers, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates or whether the product was included in the applicable formulary. We also deduct from our revenues pricing guarantees and guarantees regarding the level of service we will provide to the client or member as well as other payments made to our clients. Because the inputs to most of these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility, the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual amounts have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. 

We participate in the federal government s Medicare Part D program as a PDP through our SilverScript subsidiary. Our net revenues include insurance premiums earned by the PDP, which are determined based on the PDP s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with CMS. The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, but which is subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially deferred as accrued expenses and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits. 

In addition to these premiums, our net revenues include co-payments, coverage gap benefits, deductibles and co-insurance (collectively, the  Member Co-Payments ) related to PDP members  actual prescription claims. In certain cases, CMS subsidizes a portion of these Member Co-Payments and we are paid an estimated prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy, each month. The prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amounts received from CMS are also included in our net revenues. These amounts represent 7.2%, 5.9% and 6.3% of consolidated net revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If the prospective Member Co-Payment subsidies received differ from the amounts based on actual prescription claims, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable or accrued expenses. We account for fully insured CMS obligations and Member Co-Payments (including the amounts subsidized by CMS) using the gross   

18 

method consistent with our revenue recognition policies for Mail Co-Payments and Retail Co-Payments. We have recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from our participation in the Medicare Part D program based on information in our claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from our participation in the Medicare Part D program include: (i) estimates of low-income cost subsidy, reinsurance amounts and coverage gap discount amounts ultimately payable to or receivable from CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation, (ii) an estimate of amounts payable to CMS under a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor and (iii) estimates for claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported. Actual amounts of Medicare Part D-related assets and liabilities could differ significantly from amounts recorded. Historically, the effect of these adjustments has not been material to our results of operations or financial position. 

Retail/LTC Segment 

Retail Pharmacy   - We recognize revenue from the sale of front store merchandise at the time the merchandise is purchased by the retail customer and recognize revenue from the sale of prescription drugs when the prescription is picked up by the customer. Customer returns are not material. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 

Long-term Care   - We recognize revenue when products are delivered or services are rendered or provided to our customers, prices are fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A significant portion of our revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products are reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. Payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges. We monitor our revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as other third party insurance payors, and record an estimated contractual allowance for sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date, to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total net revenues and receivables reported in our consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Since billing functions for a portion of our revenue systems are largely computerized, enabling on-line adjudication at the time of sale to record net revenues, our exposure in connection with estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims (typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor). For the remaining portion of our revenue systems, the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed, unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims. We evaluate several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis, including historical trends based on actual claims paid, current contract and reimbursement terms, and changes in customer base and payor/product mix. Contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled, and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments was not significant to our results of operations. Further, we do not expect the impact of changes in estimates related to unsettled contractual allowance amounts from Medicare, Medicaid and third party payors as of December 31, 2017 to be significant to our future consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of our normal billing procedures and subject to our normal accounts receivable collections procedures. 

Health Care Clinics   - for services provided by our health care clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments made for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates. 

Loyalty Program   - our customer loyalty program, ExtraCare     , is comprised of two components, ExtraSavings  TM   and ExtraBucks      Rewards. ExtraSavings coupons redeemed by customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed. ExtraBucks Rewards are accrued as a charge to cost of revenues when earned, net of estimated breakage. We determine breakage based on our historical redemption patterns. 

19 

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts 

Accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies, governmental agencies and long-term care facilities), clients, members and private pay customers, as well as vendors and manufacturers. We provide a reserve for accounts receivable considered to be at increased risk of becoming uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We establish this allowance for doubtful accounts and consider such factors as historical collection experience, (i.e., payment history and credit losses) and creditworthiness, specifically identified credit risks, aging of accounts receivable by payor category, current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors. We regularly review our allowance for doubtful accounts for appropriateness. Judgment is used to assess the collectability of account balances and the economic ability of a customer to pay. 

Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2017 was $307 million, compared with $286 million as of December 31, 2016. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 2.3% of gross receivables (net of contractual allowance adjustments) as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Unforeseen future developments could lead to changes in our provision for doubtful accounts levels and future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages. For example, a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables as of December 31, 2017 would result in an increase to the provision of doubtful accounts of approximately $135 million. 

Given our experience, we believe that our aggregate reserves for potential losses are adequate, but if any of our larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations, our overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate. In particular, if economic conditions worsen, the payor mix shifts significantly or reimbursement rates are adversely affected, we may adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly, and our accounts receivable collections, cash flows, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts 

Pharmacy Services Segment 

Our Pharmacy Services Segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services Segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the results of operations. We account for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Pharmacy Services Segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services Segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of  Cost of revenues . 

Retail/LTC Segment 

Vendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC Segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract. 

20 

We have not made any material changes in the way we account for vendor allowances and purchase discounts during the past three years. 

Inventory 

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method. 

We reduce the value of our ending inventory for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are properly stated. The accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends. 

Our total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $297 million as of December 31, 2017. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help you assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimated inventory losses, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our total reserve for estimated inventory losses by about $30 million as of December 31, 2017. 

Although we believe that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, client contracts and relationships, favorable leases and covenants not to compete. These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. 

Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation techniques and management estimates. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 

We evaluate the recoverability of certain long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, but excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are tested for impairment using separate tests, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We group and evaluate these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. When evaluating these long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group s carrying value that exceeds the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). Our long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate each asset group s future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, we consider historical results and current operating trends and our consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. 

These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns. 

Goodwill and indefinitely-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 

21 

Indefinitely-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. 

Our indefinitely-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the fair value based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as the profitability of the Company. 

Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The impairment test is calculated by comparing the reporting unit s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit s goodwill is considered to be impaired and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. 

The determination of the fair value of our reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include, but are not limited to, the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates, terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating profit, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, we consider each reporting unit s historical results and current operating trends and our consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results, forecasts and industry trends. Our estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, our market capitalization, efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs including their prescription drug costs and/or increase member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns. 

The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets covered by this critical accounting policy was $38.5 billion and $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2017, respectively. We recorded $181 million in goodwill impairments in 2017 related to our RxCrossroads reporting unit, see Note 3  Goodwill and Other Intangibles  to our consolidated financial statements. We did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill or other intangible assets during 2016 or 2015. During the third quarter of 2017, we performed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitely-lived trademarks. The goodwill impairment tests resulted in the fair values of our Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins. The fair values of our LTC and RxC reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 1% and 6%, respectively. The balance of goodwill for our LTC and RxCrossroads reporting units at December 31, 2017 was approximately $6.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. On January 2, 2018, we sold our RxCrossroads reporting unit to McKesson Corporation for $725 million. 

Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to test for impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment tests. 

As previously discussed, the results of our annual goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of our LTC reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by approximately 1%. Our multi-year cash flow projections for our LTC reporting unit have declined from the prior year due to customer reimbursement pressures, industry trends such as lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities, and client retention rates. Our projected discounted cash flow model assumes future script growth from our senior living initiative and the impact of acquisitions. Such projections also include expected cost savings from labor productivity and other initiatives. Our market multiple method is heavily dependent on earnings multiples of market participants in the pharmacy industry, including certain competitors and suppliers. If we do not achieve our forecasts, given the small excess of fair value over the related carrying value, as well as current market conditions in the healthcare industry, it is reasonably possible that the operational performance of the LTC reporting unit could be below our current expectations in the near term and the LTC reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount. 

22 

We have not made any material changes in the methodologies utilized to test the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment during the past three years. 

Closed Store Lease Liability 

We account for closed store lease termination costs when a leased store is closed. When a leased store is closed, we record a liability for the estimated present value of the remaining obligation under the noncancelable lease, which includes future real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other charges, if applicable. The liability is reduced by estimated future sublease income. 

The initial calculation and subsequent evaluations of our closed store lease liability contain uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the timing and duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future lump sum settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential future sublease income. When estimating these potential termination costs and their related timing, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. 

Our total closed store lease liability covered by this critical accounting policy was $344 million as of December 31, 2017. This amount is net of $156 million of estimated sublease income that is subject to the uncertainties discussed above. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for sublease income, it is possible that actual results could differ. 

In order to help you assess the risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimated sublease income, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our total closed store lease liability by about $16 million as of December 31, 2017. 

We have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology used to record closed store lease reserves during the past three years. 

Self-Insurance Liabilities 

We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability, although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure. We are also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. 

The estimate of our self-insurance liability contains uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. When estimating our self-insurance liability, we consider a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, historical claim experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions. On a quarterly basis, we review our self-insurance liability to determine if it is adequate as it relates to our general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability. Similar reviews are conducted semi-annually to determine if our self-insurance liability is adequate for our health and medical liability. 

Our total self-insurance liability covered by this critical accounting policy was $696 million as of December 31, 2017. Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to record reasonable estimates for our self-insurance liability, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help you assess the risk, if any, associated with the uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in our estimate for our self-insurance liability, which we believe is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease our self-insurance liability by about $70 million as of December 31, 2017. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three years. 

23 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain. 

Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 

The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions. We have established accruals for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of New Accounting Pronouncements applicable to the Company. 

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the  Reform Act ) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. In addition, the Company and its representatives may, from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and in its reports to stockholders, press releases, webcasts, conference calls, meetings and other communications. Generally, the inclusion of the words  believe,   expect,   intend,   estimate,   project,   anticipate,   will,   should  and similar expressions identify statements that constitute forward-looking statements. All statements addressing operating performance of CVS Health Corporation or any subsidiary, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will occur in the future, including statements relating to corporate strategy; revenue growth; earnings or earnings per common share growth; adjusted earnings or adjusted earnings per common share growth; free cash flow; debt ratings; inventory levels; inventory turn and loss rates; store development; relocations and new market entries; retail pharmacy business, sales trends and operations; PBM business, sales trends and operations; specialty pharmacy business, sales trends and operations; LTC pharmacy business, sales trends and operations; the Company s ability to attract or retain customers and clients; Medicare Part D competitive bidding, enrollment and operations; new product development; and the impact of industry and regulatory developments, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. 

The forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 

24 

By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section within the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and including, but not limited to: 

Risks relating to the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve, which could impact consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns, drug utilization trends, the financial health of our PBM and LTC clients, retail and specialty pharmacy payors or other payors doing business with the Company and our ability to secure necessary financing, suitable store locations and sale-leaseback transactions on acceptable terms.     

Efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices, including pressure to reduce reimbursement levels for generic drugs.     

The possibility of PBM and LTC client loss and/or the failure to win new PBM and LTC business, including as a result of failure to win renewal of expiring contracts, contract termination rights that may permit clients to terminate a contract prior to expiration and early or periodic renegotiation of pricing by clients prior to expiration of a contract.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the Company s ability to record, process, summarize and report a system of internal accounting controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets are prevented or timely detected and that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and receipts and expenditures are duly authorized. In order to ensure the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. 

We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in   Internal Control-Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation, evaluation of the design effectiveness and testing of the operating effectiveness of controls. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by our internal auditors, written policies and procedures and a written Code of Conduct adopted by our Company s Board of Directors, applicable to all employees of our Company. In addition, we have an internal Disclosure Committee, comprised of management from each functional area within the Company, which performs a separate review of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls over financial reporting. 

Based on our assessment, we conclude our Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements as of December 31, 2017. 

Ernst   Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, is appointed by the Board of Directors and ratified by our Company s shareholders. They were engaged to render an opinion regarding the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements as well as conducting an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Their accompanying reports are based upon audits conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In our opinion, CVS Health Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and our report dated February 14, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

1  Significant Accounting Policies 

Description of business   - CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) is the largest integrated pharmacy health care provider in the United States based upon revenues and prescriptions filled. The Company currently has three reportable business segments, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate, which are described below. 

Pharmacy Services Segment (the  PSS )   - The PSS provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management services including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. The Company s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part D, Managed Medicaid plans, plans offered on the public and private exchanges, and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. 

As a pharmacy benefits manager, the PSS manages the dispensing of pharmaceuticals through the Company s mail order pharmacies and national network of more than 68,000 retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately 41,000 chain pharmacies and 27,000 independent pharmacies, to eligible members in the benefits plans maintained by the Company s clients and utilizes its information systems to perform, among other things, safety checks, drug interaction screenings and brand to generic substitutions. 

The PSS  specialty pharmacies support individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies. The specialty pharmacy business includes mail order and retail specialty pharmacies that operate under the CVS Caremark     , CarePlus CVS Pharmacy  TM  , Navarro      Health Services and Advanced Care Scripts ( ACS Pharmacy ) names. The Company enhanced its provides specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition services through Coram LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coram ). In August 2015, the Company further expanded its specialty offerings with the acquisition of ACS Pharmacy which was part of the Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ) acquisition. See Note 2  Acquisitions.  

The PSS also provides health management programs, which include integrated disease management for 18 conditions, through the Company s AccordantCare rare disease management offering. 

In addition, through the Company s SilverScript Insurance Company ( SilverScript ) subsidiary, the PSS is a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program. 

The PSS generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs to plan members. Prescription drugs are dispensed by the mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies and national network of retail pharmacies. Net revenues are also generated by providing additional services to clients, including administrative services such as claims processing and formulary management, as well as health care related services such as disease management. 

The PSS operates under the CVS Caremark      Pharmacy Services, Caremark     , CVS Caremark     , CVS Specialty     ,     AccordantCare, SilverScript     , Wellpartner     , Coram     , CVS Specialty     , NovoLogix     , Navarro      Health Services and ACS Pharmacy names. As of December 31, 2017, the PSS operates 23 retail specialty pharmacy stores, 18 specialty mail order pharmacies, four mail order dispensing pharmacies, and 83 branches for infusion and enteral services, including approximately 73 ambulatory infusion suites and three centers of excellence, located in 42 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. 

Retail/LTC Segment (the  RLS )   - The RLS sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, personal care products, convenience foods, photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise, and greeting cards, through the Company s CVS Pharmacy     , CVS     , CVS Pharmacy y m s     , Longs Drugs     , Navarro Discount Pharmacy      and Drogaria Onofre  TM   retail stores and online through CVS.com     , Navarro.com  TM   and Onofre.com.br  TM  . 

35 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The RLS also provides health care services through its MinuteClinic      health care clinics. MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions, perform health screenings, monitor chronic conditions and deliver vaccinations. 

In 2015, the Company made two larger acquisitions which expanded the Retail/LTC Segment s services. With the acquisition of Omnicare, the RLS began providing long-term care ( LTC ) operations, which is comprised of providing the distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings, as well as commercialization services which are provided under the name RxCrossroads      ( RxC ). With the December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation ( Target ), the Company added 1,672 pharmacies and approximately 79 clinics. 

As of December 31, 2017, our Retail/LTC Segment included 9,803 retail stores (of which 8,060 were our stores that operated a pharmacy and 1,695 were our pharmacies located within Target stores) located in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil operating primarily under the CVS Pharmacy     , CVS     , CVS Pharmacy y m s     , Longs Drugs     , Navarro Discount Pharmacy      and Drogaria Onofre  TM   names, 37 onsite pharmacies primarily operating under the CarePlus CVS Pharmacy  TM  , CarePlus      and CVS Pharmacy      names, and 1,134 retail health care clinics operating under the MinuteClinic      name (of which 1,129 were located in our retail pharmacy stores or Target stores), and our online retail websites, CVS.com     , Navarro.com  TM   and Onofre.com.br  TM  . LTC operations are comprised of 145 spoke pharmacies that primarily handle new prescription orders, of which 30 are also hub pharmacies that use proprietary automation to support spoke pharmacies with refill prescriptions. LTC operates primarily under the Omnicare      and NeighborCare      names. 

Corporate Segment   - The Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the Company. The Corporate Segment consists of certain aspects of the Company s executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments. 

Principles of consolidation   - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

The Company continually evaluates its investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a VIE. If the Company determines that it has a variable interest in a VIE, the Company then evaluates if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether the Company has the ability to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. 

Assets and liabilities of VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company s consolidated financial statements. VIE creditors do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company. 

Use of estimates   - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Fair value hierarchy   - The Company utilizes the three-level valuation hierarchy for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and liabilities within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy consist of the following: 

Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.     

36 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument.     

Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon management s best estimate of inputs market participants could use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk.     

Cash and cash equivalents   - Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-term money market funds, commercial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. 

Restricted cash   - As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $190 million and $149 million, respectively, of restricted cash held in a trust in its insurance captive to satisfy collateral requirements associated with the assignment of certain insurance policies. Such amounts are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had $14 million of restricted cash held in escrow accounts in connection with certain recent acquisitions. Such amounts are included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. All restricted cash is invested in time deposits which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Short-term investments   - The Company s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with initial maturities of greater than three months when purchased that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date. These investments, which were classified as available-for-sale within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, were carried at fair value, which approximated their historical cost at December 31, 2017 and 2016. 

Fair value of financial instruments   - As of December 31, 2017, the Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate their fair value due to the nature of these financial instruments. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of total long-term debt was $25.7 billion and $26.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was estimated based on quoted rates currently offered in active markets for the Company s debt, which is considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative financial instruments   - The Company is exposed to interest rate risk and management considers it prudent to periodically reduce the Company s exposure to cash flow variability resulting from interest rate fluctuations. In December 2017, the Company entered into several interest rate swap transactions. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the anticipated issuance of long-term debt in connection with the proposed acquisition of Aetna Inc. ( Aetna ). The interest rate swaps had notional amounts totaling $4.75 billion. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of these agreements were a $5 million asset recorded in other current assets and a $23 million liability recorded in accrued expenses. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was determined using quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability and therefore they are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company has deferred gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income which are expected to be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying forecasted debt. The hedges are expected to be highly effective; therefore, no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings. There were no outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2016. 

Foreign currency translation and transactions   - For local currency functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 

37 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

For U.S. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income. 

Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements were not material for all periods presented. 

Accounts receivable   - Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The accounts receivable balance primarily includes amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies, governmental agencies and long-term care facilities), clients, members and private pay customers, as well as vendors and manufacturers. Charges to bad debt are based on both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. 

The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for the years ended December 31 is as follows: 

Inventories   - Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and long-term care pharmacy and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical results and current trends. 

Property and equipment   - Property, equipment and improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or when applicable, the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for fixtures, equipment and internally developed software. Repair and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Application development stage costs for significant internally developed software projects are capitalized and depreciated. 

The following are the components of property and equipment at December 31: 

The gross amount of property and equipment under capital leases was $588 million and $547 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accumulated amortization of property and equipment under capital lease was $140 million   

38 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

and $119 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization of property and equipment under capital lease is included within depreciation expense. Depreciation expense totaled $1.7 billion in both 2017 and 2016, and $1.5 billion in 2015. 

Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets   - Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment reviews annually, or more frequently if necessary. See Note 3  Goodwill and Other Intangibles  for additional information on goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets. 

Intangible assets   - Purchased customer contracts and relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives between 9 and 20 years. Purchased customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to 10 years. Purchased leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the lease. See Note 3  Goodwill and Other Intangibles  for additional information about intangible assets. 

Impairment of long-lived assets   - The Company groups and evaluates fixed and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group s carrying value that exceeds the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). 

Redeemable noncontrolling interest   - As a result of the acquisition of Omnicare in 2015, the Company obtained a 73% ownership interest in a limited liability company ( LLC ). Due to the change in control in Omnicare, the noncontrolling member of the LLC had the contractual right to put its membership interest to the Company at fair value. Consequently, the noncontrolling interest in the LLC was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at fair value. During 2016, the noncontrolling shareholder of the LLC exercised its option to sell its ownership interest and the Company purchased the noncontrolling interest in the LLC for approximately $39 million. 

Below is a summary of the changes in redeemable noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31:

Revenue Recognition 

Pharmacy Services Segment 

The PSS sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through its retail pharmacy network. The PSS recognizes revenue from prescription drugs sold by its mail service dispensing pharmacies and under retail pharmacy network contracts where it is the principal using the gross method at the contract prices negotiated with its clients. Net revenues include: (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the PSS, net of any volume-related or other discounts paid back to the client (see  Drug Discounts  below), (ii) the price paid to the PSS by client plan members for mail order prescriptions ( Mail Co-Payments ) and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions ( Retail Co-Payments ), and (iii) administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts where the PSS is not the principal as discussed below. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 

39 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Revenue is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the PSS: 

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription is delivered. At the time of delivery, the PSS has performed substantially all of its obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.     

Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the PSS  retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the PSS  point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the PSS online claims processing system.     

The PSS determines whether it is the principal or agent for its retail pharmacy network transactions on a contract by contract basis. In the majority of its contracts, the PSS has determined it is the principal due to it: (i) being the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) having latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) having discretion in supplier selection, (iv) having involvement in the determination of product or service specifications, and (v) having credit risk. The PSS  obligations under its client contracts for which revenues are reported using the gross method are separate and distinct from its obligations to the third party pharmacies included in its retail pharmacy network contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, the PSS is contractually required to pay the third party pharmacies in its retail pharmacy network for products sold, regardless of whether the PSS is paid by its clients. The PSS  responsibilities under its client contracts typically include validating eligibility and coverage levels, communicating the prescription price and the co-payments due to the third party retail pharmacy, identifying possible adverse drug interactions for the pharmacist to address with the prescriber prior to dispensing, suggesting generic alternatives where clinically appropriate and approving the prescription for dispensing. Although the PSS does not have credit risk with respect to Retail Co-Payments or inventory risk related to retail network claims, management believes that all of the other applicable indicators of gross revenue reporting are present. For contracts under which the PSS acts as an agent, revenue is recognized using the net method. 

Drug Discounts   - The PSS deducts from its revenues any rebates, inclusive of discounts and fees, earned by its clients. Rebates are paid to clients in accordance with the terms of client contracts, which are normally based on fixed rebates per prescription for specific products dispensed or a percentage of manufacturer discounts received for specific products dispensed. The liability for rebates due to clients is included in  Claims and discounts payable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

Medicare Part D   - The PSS, through its SilverScript subsidiary, participates in the federal government s Medicare Part D program as a Prescription Drug Plan ( PDP ). Net revenues include insurance premiums earned by the PDP, which are determined based on the PDP s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). The insurance premiums include a direct premium paid by CMS and a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, but which is subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members. Premiums collected in advance are initially deferred in accrued expenses and are then recognized in net revenues over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits. 

In addition to these premiums, net revenues include co-payments, coverage gap benefits, deductibles and co-insurance (collectively, the  Member Co-Payments ) related to PDP members  actual prescription claims. In certain cases, CMS subsidizes a portion of these Member Co-Payments and pays the PSS an estimated prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amount each month. The prospective Member Co-Payment subsidy amounts received from CMS are also included in net revenues. SilverScript assumes no risk for these amounts. If the prospective Member Co-Payment subsidies received differ from the amounts based on actual prescription claims, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable or accrued expenses. 

The PSS accounts for CMS obligations and Member Co-Payments (including the amounts subsidized by CMS) using the gross method consistent with its revenue recognition policies for Mail Co-Payments and Retail Co-Payments (discussed previously in this document).

Retail/LTC Segment 

Retail Pharmacy -   The retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Customer returns are not material. Revenue generated from the performance of services in the RLS  health care clinics is recognized at the time the services are performed. Sales taxes are not included in revenue. 

Long-term Care   - Revenue is recognized when products are delivered or services are rendered or provided to the customer, prices are fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A significant portion of the revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products are reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. Payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as other third party insurance payors, and record an estimated contractual allowance for sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date, to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total net sales and receivables reported in the Company s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Since billing functions for a portion of the Company s revenue systems are largely computerized, enabling on-line adjudication at the time of sale to record net revenues, the Company s exposure in connection with estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims (typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor). For the remaining portion of the Company s revenue systems, the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed, unbilled and initially rejected Medicare, Medicaid and third party claims. The Company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis, including historical trends based on actual claims paid, current contract and reimbursement terms, and changes in customer base and payor/product mix. Contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled, and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments was not significant to our results of operations for any of the periods presented. 

Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of our normal billing procedures and subject to our normal accounts receivable collections procedures. 

Health Care Clinics   - For services provided by our health care clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates. 

Loyalty Program   - The Company s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare     , is comprised of two components, ExtraSavings  TM   and ExtraBucks      Rewards. ExtraSavings coupons redeemed by customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed. ExtraBucks Rewards are accrued as a charge to cost of revenues when earned, net of estimated breakage. The Company determines breakage based on historical redemption patterns. 

See Note 13  Segment Reporting  for additional information about the revenues of the Company s business segments. 

Cost of revenues 

Pharmacy Services Segment   - The PSS  cost of revenues includes: (i) the cost of prescription drugs sold during the reporting period directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through its retail pharmacy network, (ii) shipping and handling costs, and (iii) the operating costs of its mail service dispensing pharmacies and client service operations and related information technology support costs including depreciation and amortization. The cost of prescription drugs sold component of cost of revenues includes: (i) the cost of the prescription drugs purchased from manufacturers or distributors and shipped to members in clients  benefit plans from the PSS  mail service dispensing pharmacies, net of any volume-related or other discounts (see  Vendor allowances and purchase discounts  below) and (ii) the cost of prescription drugs sold (including Retail Co-Payments) through the PSS  retail pharmacy network under contracts where it is the principal, net of any volume-related or other discounts. 

41 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Retail/LTC Segment   - The RLS  cost of revenues includes: the cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period and the related purchasing costs, warehousing and delivery costs (including depreciation and amortization) and actual and estimated inventory losses. 

See Note 13  Segment Reporting  for additional information about the cost of revenues of the Company s business segments. 

Vendor allowances and purchase discounts 

The Company accounts for vendor allowances and purchase discounts as follows: 

Pharmacy Services Segment   - The PSS receives purchase discounts on products purchased. The PSS  contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the PSS to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices, or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the PSS  results of operations. The PSS accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The PSS also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined annual purchase volumes. In addition, the PSS receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of  Cost of revenues . 

Retail/LTC Segment   - Vendor allowances received by the RLS reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract. The total amortization of these upfront payments was not material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Insurance   - The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers  compensation and auto liability. The Company obtains third party insurance coverage to limit exposure from these claims. The Company is also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. The Company s self-insurance accruals, which include reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, are calculated using standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions and the Company s historical claims experience. 

Facility opening and closing costs   - New facility opening costs, other than capital expenditures, are charged directly to expense when incurred. When the Company closes a facility, the present value of estimated unrecoverable costs, including the remaining lease obligation less estimated sublease income and the book value of abandoned property and equipment, are charged to expense. The long-term portion of the lease obligations associated with facility closings was $306 million and $181 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Advertising costs   - Advertising costs are expensed when the related advertising takes place. Advertising costs, net of vendor funding (included in operating expenses), were $2  30   million, $216 million and $221 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Interest expense, net   - The following are the components of net interest expense for the years ended December 31: 

Capitalized interest totaled $  8   million, $13 million and $12 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Shares held in trust   - The Company maintains grantor trusts, which held approximately one million shares of its common stock at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These shares are designated for use under various employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted shares outstanding. 

Accumulated other comprehensive income   - Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of changes in the net actuarial gains and losses associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans, net losses on cash flow hedge derivative instruments associated with forecasted debt issuances, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Company s pension and postretirement plans was $  34   million pre-tax ($21 million after-tax) as of December 31, 2017 and $284 million pre-tax ($173 million after-tax) as of December 31, 2016. The net impact on cash flow hedges totaled $24 million pre-tax ($15 million after-tax) and $9 million pre-tax ($5 million after-tax) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $129 million and $127 million, respectively. 

Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component are shown below: 

(1) 

All amounts are net of tax.     

(2) 

The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income for cash flow hedges are recorded within interest expense, net on the consolidated statement of income. The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income for pension and other postretirement benefits are included in other expense on the consolidated statement of income.         

43 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Stock-based compensation   - Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable requisite service period of the stock award (generally 3 to 5 years) using the straight-line method. 

Variable interest entity   - In 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ( Cardinal ) established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ( Red Oak ), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own 50%. The Red Oak arrangement has an initial term of ten years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak by either company and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. 

The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity because it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within the Retail/LTC Segment. 

Cardinal is required to pay the Company 39 quarterly payments beginning in October 2014. As milestones are met, the quarterly payments increase. The Company received approximately $183 million, $163 million and $122 million from Cardinal during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The payments reduce the Company s carrying value of inventory and are recognized in cost of revenues when the related inventory is sold. Revenues associated with Red Oak expenses reimbursed by Cardinal for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as amounts due to or due from Cardinal at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were immaterial. 

Related party transactions   - The Company has an equity method investment in SureScripts, LLC ( SureScripts ), which operates a clinical health information network. The Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments utilize this clinical health information network in providing services to its client plan members and retail customers. The Company expensed fees of approximately $35 million, $39 million and $50 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the use of this network. The Company s investment in and equity in earnings of SureScripts for all periods presented is immaterial. 

The Company has an equity method investment in Heartland Healthcare Services ( Heartland ). Heartland operates several long-term care pharmacies in four states. Heartland paid the Company approximately $139 million, $140 million and $25 million for pharmaceutical inventory purchases during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the Company performs certain collection functions for Heartland and then passes those customer cash collections to Heartland. The Company s investment in and equity in earnings of Heartland as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is immaterial. 

In 2016, the Company made charitable contributions of $32 million to the CVS Foundation (the  Foundation ) to fund future giving. The Foundation is an unconsolidated non-profit entity managed by employees of the Company that focuses on health, education and community involvement programs. The charitable contributions were recorded as operating expenses in the Company s consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Income taxes   - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year or years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in the tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  (the  TCJA ). Among numerous changes to existing tax laws, the TCJA permanently reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The effects on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates are required to be taken into consideration in the period in which the changes are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. As the result of the   

44 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

reduction of the corporate income tax rate under the TCJA, the Company estimated the revaluation of its net deferred tax liabilities and recorded a provisional noncash income tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion for year ended December 31, 2017. The Company has not completed all of its processes to determine the TCJA s final impact. The final impact may differ from this provisional amount due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made thus far and the issuance of additional regulatory or other guidance. The accounting is expected to be completed by the time the 2017 federal income tax return is filed in 2018. 

The Company recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. To the extent that the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. 

The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 

Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. 

Discontinued operations -   In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Bob s Stores and Linens  n Things which filed for bankruptcy in 2016 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, the Company s recently acquired Bluegrass Pharmacy is considered held for sale and is included in discontinued operations (see Note 2  Acquisitions  for additional information). The Company s loss from discontinued operations in 2017 and 2016 primarily includes lease-related costs which the Company believes it will likely be required to satisfy pursuant to its lease guarantees. The Company s income from discontinued operations in 2015 of $9 million, net of tax, was related to the release of certain store lease guarantees due to a settlement with a landlord. See Note 12  Commitments and Contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements. 

Below is a summary of the results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31: 

Earnings per common share   - Earnings per share is computed using the two-class method. Options to purchase 10.4 million, 6.7 million and 2.7 million shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the options  exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. 

New accounting pronouncements recently adopted   - In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-11,   Inventory  , which amends Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 330. This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at  the lower of cost and net realizable value  rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2017. The adoption of this new guidance did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which amends the accounting for certain aspects of shared-based payments to employees in ASC Topic 718,     

45 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Compensation - Stock Compensation  . The new guidance eliminates the accounting for any excess tax benefits and deficiencies through equity, and requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to employee share-based compensation arrangements to be recorded in the income statement. This aspect of the guidance is required to be applied prospectively. The guidance also requires the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows as an operating activity rather than a financing activity, a change which may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The guidance further provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than utilizing the estimated amount of forfeitures at the time of issuance. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2017. The primary impact of adopting this guidance was the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement instead of recognizing them in equity. This income statement guidance was adopted on a prospective basis. As a result, a discrete tax benefit of $53 million was recognized in the income tax provision in the year ended December 31, 2017.  

The Company elected to retrospectively adopt the guidance on the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of the effect of the resulting reclassification of the excess tax benefits on the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: 

The Company elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. None of the other provisions in this guidance had a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07,   Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost  , which amends ASC Topic 715,   Compensation   Retirement Benefits  . ASU 2017-07 requires entities to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost and present it with other current compensation costs for related employees in the income statement and present the other components of net benefit cost elsewhere in the income statement and outside of operating income. Only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of any annual periods for which an entity s financial statements have not been issued. Entities are required to retrospectively apply the requirement for a separate presentation in the income statement of service costs and other components of net benefit cost and prospectively adopt the requirement to limit the capitalization of benefit costs to the service component. The Company adopted the income statement presentation aspects of this new guidance on a retrospective basis effective January 1, 2017. Nearly all of the Company s net benefit costs for the Company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans do not contain a service cost component as most of these defined benefit plans have been frozen for an extended period of time.  

46 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following is a reconciliation of the effect of the reclassification of the net benefit cost from operating expenses to other expense in the Company s consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31 2016 and 2015: 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,   Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment  , which amends ASC Topic 350,   Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  . This ASU requires the Company to perform its annual, or applicable interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge must be recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit; however, the charge recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Income tax effects resulting from any tax deductible goodwill should be considered when measuring a goodwill impairment charge, if applicable. The guidance in ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company elected to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017. At the date of adoption of this new guidance, the guidance did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,   Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities  ,     which amends ASC Topic 815,   Derivative and Hedging  . ASU 2017-12 expands an entity s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components and reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. It eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. ASU 2017-12 also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interims periods with those years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance with respect to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships existing on the date of adoption must be applied on a modified retrospective basis, and the new presentation and disclosure requirements must be applied on a prospective basis. The Company elected to early adopt this standard as of October 1, 2017. As the date of adoption of this new guidance, the guidance did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows since the Company did not have any outstanding derivative instruments at that time. 

New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted   - In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net)  ,  which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and in April 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ,  which amends the guidance in those areas in the new revenue recognition standard. The new revenue standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect that the implementation of the new standard will have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The new standard will however require more extensive revenue-related disclosures. The Company has identified one difference in its Retail/LTC Segment related to the accounting for its ExtraBucks Rewards customer loyalty program, which is currently accounted for under a cost deferral method. Under the new standard, this program will be accounted for under a revenue deferral method. On   

47 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue standard on a modified retrospective basis and recorded an after-tax transition adjustment to reduce retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 by approximately $13 million. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall   (Subtopic 825-10)  : Recognition and Measurement of financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . This ASU requires equity investments, except those under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of an investee, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. This simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments previously held at cost. Separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category is required. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Entities are required to apply the guidance retrospectively, with the exception of the amendments related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which must be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this guidance but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842). Lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, a dual model was retained, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model (e.g., certain definitions, such as initial direct costs, have been updated) and the new revenue recognition standard. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company believes that the new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of this standard will have on the Company s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . ASU 2016-15 is intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and to eliminate the diversity in practice related to such classifications. The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this guidance but does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated cash flows. 

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,   Statement of Cash Flows  , which amends ASC Topic 230. This ASU requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer be required to present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. When cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires a reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related captions in the balance sheet. Entities will also have to disclose the nature of their restricted cash and restricted cash equivalent balances. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to apply the guidance retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this guidance but does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated cash flows.

2  Acquisitions 

Proposed Aetna Acquisition 

On December 3, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Aetna for a combination of cash and stock. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Aetna shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. The transaction values Aetna at approximately $207 per share or approximately $69 billion based on the Company s 5-day volume weighted average price ending December 1, 2017 of $74.21 per share. Including the assumption of Aetna s debt, the total value of the transaction is approximately $77 billion. The final purchase price will be determined based on the Company s stock price on the date of closing of the transaction. 

The proposed acquisition remains subject to approval by CVS Health and Aetna shareholders and customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the waiting period under the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and approvals of state departments of insurance and U.S. and international regulators. 

If the transaction is not completed, the Company could be liable to Aetna for a termination fee of $2.1 billion in connection with the merger agreement, depending on the reasons leading to such termination. 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $34 million of transaction-related costs in operating expenses in connection with the proposed acquisition. 

Wellpartner Acquisition 

On November 30, 2017, the Company acquired Wellpartner, Inc. ( Wellpartner ) for approximately $380 million. The purchase price is subject to a working capital adjustment. Wellpartner is a provider of specialty pharmacy services which provides products and services under the Section 340B drug discount program, which is a U.S. federal government program that requires drug manufacturers participating in the Medicaid program to provide outpatient drugs to eligible health care organizations and covered entities at significantly reduced prices.

The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were $532 million and $152 million, respectively, which included identifiable intangible assets of $233 million and goodwill of $182 million that were recorded in the PSS. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and is based on information that was available to management at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared, accordingly, the allocation may change. The Company has classified the assets of Bluegrass Pharmacy as held for sale, and has reported Bluegrass Pharmacy as a discontinued operation. The assets held for sale and the operating results of Bluegrass Pharmacy as of and for the month ended December 31, 2017 are immaterial.

3  Goodwill and Other Intangibles 

Goodwill and other indefinitely-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. 

When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  

During 2017, the Company began pursuing various strategic alternatives for its RxC reporting unit. In connection with this effort, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2017. The results of the impairment test determined that the fair value of the RxC reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in a $135 million goodwill impairment charge within operating expenses during the second quarter of 2017.  

During the third quarter of 2017, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of its reporting units and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill. 

On January 2, 2018, the Company sold RxC to McKesson Corporation for $725 million. The transaction is subject to a working capital adjustment. 

The TCJA enacted on December 22, 2017 reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018 (see Note 11  Income Taxes ). As a result, the RxC deferred income tax liabilities were reduced by $47 million and an income tax benefit of $47 million was recorded in the 2017 income statement. The reduction in the deferred income tax liabilities increased the carrying value of the RxC reporting unit by $47 million which triggered an additional goodwill impairment in the RxC reporting unit of $46 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.  

The Company has cumulative goodwill impairments of $181 million as of December 31, 2017. 

Below is a summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: 

(1) 

Other  represents immaterial purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions.     

Indefinitely-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinitely-lived trademark using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company performed its annual impairment test of the indefinitely-lived trademark and concluded there was no impairment as of the testing date.

The following table is a summary of the Company s intangible assets as of December 31: 

The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which have a weighted average useful life of 15.4 years. The weighted average useful life of the Company s customer contracts and relationships and covenants not to compete is 15.3 years. The weighted average life of the Company s favorable leases and other intangible assets is 16.2 years. Amortization expense for intangible assets totaled $817 million, $  795   million and $  611   million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The anticipated annual amortization expense for these intangible assets for the next five years is as follows: 

4  Share Repurchase Programs 

The following share repurchase programs were authorized by the Company s Board of Directors: 

The share Repurchase Programs, each of which was effective immediately, permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2016 Repurchase Program can be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. 

Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, in August 2016, the Company entered into two fixed dollar ASRs with Barclays Bank PLC ( Barclays ) for a total of $3.6 billion. Upon payment of the $3.6 billion purchase price in January 2017, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to 80% of the $3.6 billion notional amount of the ASRs or approximately 36.1 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2017. The ASRs were accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $2.9 billion and a forward contract for $0.7 billion. In April 2017, the Company received 9.9 million shares of common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $3.6 billion notional amount of the ASRs, thereby concluding the ASRs. The remaining 9.9 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in April 2017. 

53 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Pursuant to the authorization under the 2014 Repurchase Program, in December 2015, the Company entered into a $725 million fixed dollar ASR with Barclays. Upon payment of the $725 million purchase price in December 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to 80% of the $725 million notional amount of the ASR or approximately 6.2 million shares. The initial 6.2 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in December 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of $580 million and a forward contract of $145 million. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet. In January 2016, the Company received 1.4 million shares of common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $725 million notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining 1.4 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by Barclays were placed into treasury stock in January 2016 and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock. 

Pursuant to the authorization under the 2013 Repurchase Programs, in January 2015, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar ASR agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( JP Morgan ). Upon payment of the $2.0 billion purchase price in January 2015, the Company received a number of shares of its common stock equal to 80% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR agreement or approximately 16.8 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2015. In May 2015, the Company received approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. The remaining 3.1 million shares of common stock delivered to the Company by JP Morgan were placed into treasury stock in May 2015. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of $1.6 billion and a forward contract of $0.4 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was initially recorded within capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet and was reclassified to treasury stock upon the settlement of the ASR in May 2015. 

In the ASR transactions described above, the initial repurchase of the shares and delivery of the remainder of the shares to conclude the ASR, resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 55.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $4.4 billion under the 2014 and 2016 Repurchase Programs. As of December 31, 2017, there remained an aggregate of approximately $13.9 billion available for future repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program and the 2014 and 2013 Repurchase Programs were complete. 

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 47.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $4.5 billion under the 2014 Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 48.0 million shares of common stock for approximately $5.0 billion under the 2013 and 2014 Repurchase Programs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

On December 3, 2017, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Aetna, the Company entered into a $49.0 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. The Company paid approximately $221 million in fees upon entering into the agreement. The fees were capitalized in other current assets and will be amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility is outstanding. The bridge loan facility was reduced to $44.0 billion on December 15, 2017 upon the Company entering into a $5.0 billion term loan agreement. The Company recorded $56 million of amortization of the bridge loan facility fees during the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, which was recorded in interest expense. On December 15, 2017, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Aetna, the Company entered into a $5.0 billion unsecured term loan agreement. The term loan facility under the term loan agreement consists of a $3.0 billion three-year tranche and a $2.0 billion five-year tranche. The term loan facility allows for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly commitment fee, regardless of usage. 

On January 3, 2017, the Company entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility allows for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately 0.03%, regardless of usage. The Company terminated the credit facility in May 2017. 

On May 16, 2016, the Company issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.125% unsecured senior notes due June 1, 2021 and $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.875% unsecured senior notes due June 1, 2026 (collectively, the  2016 Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The 2016 Notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company s option at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The net proceeds of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repay certain corporate debt. 

On May 16, 2016, the Company announced tender offers for (1) any and all of its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2017, its 6.60% Senior Notes due 2019 and its 4.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (collectively, the  Any and All Notes ) and (2) up to $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2027, its 6.125% Senior Notes due 2039, its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2041, the 5.00% Senior Notes due 2024 issued by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Omnicare, Inc. ( Omnicare ), the 4.75% Senior Notes due 2022 issued by Omnicare, its 4.875% Senior Notes due 2035 and its 3.875% Senior Notes due 2025 (collectively, the  Maximum Tender Offer Notes  and together with the Any and All Notes, the  Notes ). On May 31, 2016, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the tender offers for the Maximum Tender Offer Notes to $2.25 billion. The Company purchased approximately $835 million aggregate principal amount of the Any and All Notes and $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the Maximum Tender Offer Notes pursuant to the tender offers, which expired on June 13, 2016. The Company paid a premium of $486 million in excess of the debt principal in connection with the purchase of the Notes, wrote off $50 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $6 million in fees, for a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $542 million which was recorded in income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

On June 27, 2016, the Company notified the holders of the remaining Any and All Notes that the Company was exercising its option to redeem the outstanding Any and All Notes pursuant to the terms of the Any and All Notes and the Indenture dated as of August 15, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. Approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Any and All Notes was redeemed on July 27, 2016. The Company paid a premium of $97 million in excess of the debt principal and wrote off $4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $101 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. 

The Company recorded a total loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $643 million which was recorded in the income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

On May 20, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Omnicare, the Company entered into a $13 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. The Company paid approximately $52 million in fees in connection with the facility. The fees were capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility was outstanding. The bridge loan facility   

56 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

expired on July 20, 2015 upon the Company s issuance of unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal of $15 billion as discussed below. The bridge loan facility fees became fully amortized in July 2015. 

On July 20, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of $2.25 billion of 1.9% unsecured senior notes due 2018 ( 2018 Notes ), an aggregate of $2.75 billion of 2.8% unsecured senior notes due 2020 ( 2020 Notes ), an aggregate of $1.5 billion of 3.5% unsecured senior notes due 2022 ( 2022 Notes ), an aggregate of $3 billion of 3.875% unsecured senior notes due 2025 ( 2025 Notes ), an aggregate of $2 billion of 4.875% unsecured senior notes due 2035 ( 2035 Notes ), and an aggregate of $3.5 billion of 5.125% unsecured senior notes due 2045 ( 2045 Notes  and, together with the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2035 Notes, the  Notes ) for total proceeds of approximately $14.8 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The Notes pay interest semi-annually and contain redemption terms which allow or require the Company to redeem the Notes at a defined redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest at the redemption date. The net proceeds of the Notes were used to fund the Omnicare acquisition and the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 

Upon the closing of the Omnicare acquisition in August 2015, the Company assumed the long-term debt of Omnicare that had a fair value of approximately $3.1 billion, $2.0 billion of which was previously convertible into Omnicare shares that holders were able to redeem subsequent to the acquisition. During the period from August 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015, all but $5 million of the $2.0 billion of previously convertible debt was redeemed and repaid and approximately $0.4 billion in Omnicare term debt assumed was repaid for total repayments of Omnicare debt of approximately $2.4 billion in 2015. 

The remaining principal of the Omnicare debt assumed was comprised of senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $700 million ($400 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2022 and $300 million of 5% senior notes due 2024). In September 2015, the Company commenced exchange offers for the 4.75% senior notes due 2022 and the 5% senior notes due 2024 to exchange all validly tendered and accepted notes issued by Omnicare for notes to be issued by the Company. This offer expired on October 20, 2015 and the aggregate principal amounts of $388 million of the 4.75% senior notes due 2022 and $296 million of the 5% senior notes due 2024 were validly tendered and exchanged for notes issued by the Company. The Company recorded this exchange transaction as a modification of the original debt instruments. Consequently, no gain or loss on extinguishment was recognized in the Company s consolidated income statement as a result of this exchange transaction and the issuance costs of the new debt were expensed as incurred. 

The back-up credit facilities and unsecured senior notes contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. The covenants do not materially affect the Company s financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2017, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. 

The following is a summary of the Company s required principal debt repayments due during each of the next five years and thereafter, as of December 31, 2017: 

6  Store Closures 

In December 2016, the Company announced an enterprise streamlining initiative designed to reduce costs and enhance operating efficiencies to allow the Company to be more competitive in the current health care environment. In connection with the enterprise streamlining initiative, the Company announced its intention to rationalize the number of retail stores by closing approximately 70 underperforming stores during the year ending December 31, 2017. During the   

57 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

year ended December 31, 2017, the Company closed 71 retail stores and recorded charges of $215 million within operating expenses in the Retail/LTC Segment. The charges are primarily comprised of provisions for the present value of noncancelable lease obligations. The noncancelable lease obligations associated with stores closed during the year ended December 31, 2017 extend through the year 2039. 

7    Leases 

The Company leases most of its retail and mail order locations, 13 of its distribution centers and certain corporate offices under noncancelable operating leases, typically with initial terms of 15 to 25 years and with options that permit renewals for additional periods. The Company also leases certain equipment and other assets under noncancelable operating leases, typically with initial terms of 3 to 10 years. In December 2015, in connection with the acquisition of the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target, the Company entered into lease agreements with Target for the pharmacy and clinic space within Target stores. Given that the noncancelable contractual term of the pharmacy lease arrangement exceeds the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings being leased, the Company concluded for accounting purposes that the lease term was the remaining economic life of the buildings. Consequently, most of the individual pharmacy leases are capital leases. Approximately $0.3 billion of capital lease obligations were recorded in connection with this transaction. 

Minimum rent on operating leases is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition to minimum rental payments, certain leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed when incurred. 

The following table is a summary of the Company s net rental expense for operating leases for the years ended December 31: 

58 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table is a summary of the future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases as of December 31, 2017: 

(1) 

Future operating lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $171 million due in the future under noncancelable subleases.     

(2) 

The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target. Amounts related to such capital and operating leases are reflected above. Amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings of approximately $1.9 billion are not reflected herein since the estimated economic life of the buildings is shorter than the contractual term of the lease arrangement.     

The Company finances a portion of its store development program through sale-leaseback transactions. The properties are generally sold at net book value, which generally approximates fair value, and the resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. The operating leases that resulted from these transactions are included in the above table. The Company does not have any retained or contingent interests in the stores and does not provide any guarantees, other than a guarantee of lease payments, in connection with the sale-leaseback transactions. Proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions totaled $265 million in 2017, $230 million in 2016 and $411 million in 2015. 

8    Medicare Part D 

The Company offers Medicare Part D benefits through SilverScript, which has contracted with CMS to be a PDP and, pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, must be a risk-bearing entity regulated under state insurance laws or similar statutes. 

SilverScript is a licensed domestic insurance company under the applicable laws and regulations. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, SilverScript must file quarterly and annual reports with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) and certain state regulators, must maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus under a formula established by the NAIC and must, in certain circumstances, request and receive the approval of certain state regulators before making dividend payments or other capital distributions to the Company. The Company does not believe these limitations on dividends and distributions materially impact its financial position. 

The Company has recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from its participation in the Medicare Part D program based on information in its claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from its participation in this program include: (i) estimates of low-income cost subsidy, reinsurance amounts, and coverage gap discount amounts ultimately payable to or receivable from CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation that will occur in the following year; (ii) an estimate of amounts receivable from or payable to CMS under a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor and (iii) estimates for claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported.

9  Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Defined Contribution Plans 

The Company sponsors several voluntary 401(k) savings plans that cover all employees who meet plan eligibility requirements. The Company makes matching contributions consistent with the provisions of the plans. 

At the participant s option, account balances, including the Company s matching contribution, can be transferred without restriction among various investment options, including the Company s common stock fund under one of the defined contribution plans. The Company also maintains a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key employees. This plan provides participants the opportunity to defer portions of their eligible compensation and receive matching contributions equivalent to what they could have received under the CVS Health 401(k) Plan absent certain restrictions and limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company s contributions under the above defined contribution plans were $314 million, $295 million and $251 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans 

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company sponsored seven defined benefit pension plans, all of which are closed to new participants. Two of the plans are tax-qualified plans that are funded based on actuarial calculations and applicable federal laws and regulations. The other five plans are unfunded nonqualified supplemental retirement plans. In 2015, the Company terminated its largest tax-qualified plan and in 2017, the Company terminated the other tax-qualified plan.  

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company settled the pension obligations of its two tax-qualified plans by irrevocably transferring pension liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of group annuity contracts and through lump sum distributions. These purchases, funded with pension plan assets, resulted in pre-tax settlement losses of $187 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the recognition of accumulated deferred actuarial losses. The settlement losses are included in other expense in the consolidated statement of income. 

The following tables outline the change in benefit obligations and plan assets over the comparable periods:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The components of net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31 are shown below: 

Pension Plan Assumptions 

The Company uses a series of actuarial assumptions to determine the benefit obligations and the net benefit costs. The discount rate is determined by examining the current yields observed on the measurement date of fixed-interest, high quality investments expected to be available during the period to maturity of the related benefits on a plan by plan basis. In 2016, the discount rate for the qualified plan that had been terminated was determined by examining the current assumed lump sum and annuity purchase rates. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the plan s target allocation and historical returns for each asset class on a plan by plan basis. Certain of the Company s pension plans use assumptions on expected compensation increases of plan participants. These increases are determined by an actuarial analysis of the plan participants, their expected compensation increases, and the duration of their earnings period until retirement. Each of these assumptions is reviewed as plan characteristics change and on an annual basis with input from senior pension and financial executives and the Company s external actuarial consultants. 

The discount rate for determining plan benefit obligations was 3.5% in 2017 and 4.0% in 2016 for all plans, except the terminated qualified plan. The discount rate for the terminated qualified plan was 3.09% in 2016. The expected long-term rate of return for the plans ranged from 4.0% to 5.5% in 2017 and 2016. The rate of compensation increases for certain of the plans with active participants ranged from 4.0% to 6.0% in 2017 and 2016. 

Return on Plan Assets 

The Company s investment strategy for its two qualified pension plans was liability management driven. The asset allocation targets were to hold fixed income investments based upon this strategy. The following tables show the fair value allocation of plan assets by asset category as of December 31, 2016. 

As of December 31, 2016, the Company s qualified defined benefit pension plan assets consisted of 5% equity, 94% fixed income and 1% money market securities of which 7% were classified as Level 1 and 93% as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company had no investments in Level 3 alternative investments during the year ended December 31, 2016. 

As of December 31, 2017, the assets in the Company s qualified defined benefit pension plans had been fully liquidated through the purchase of group annuity contracts and through lump sum distributions.

Cash Flows 

The Company contributed $46 million, $25 million and $22 million to the pension plans during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company plans to make approximately $21 million in contributions to the pension plans during 2018. These contributions include contributions made to certain nonqualified benefit plans for which there is no funding requirement. The Company estimates the following future benefit payments which are calculated using the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017: 

Multiemployer Pension Plans 

The Company also contributes to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following aspects: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. 

None of the multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates are individually significant to the Company. Total Company contributions to multiemployer pension plans were $17 million in 2017, $15 million in 2016 and $14 million in 2015. 

Other Postretirement Benefits 

The Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees who meet eligibility requirements. The Company s funding policy is generally to pay covered expenses as they are incurred. For retiree medical plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company s other postretirement benefits had an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $25 million and $24 million, respectively. Net periodic benefit costs related to these other postretirement benefits were $1 million in both 2017 and 2016, and $2 million in 2015. 

Pursuant to various collective bargaining agreements, the Company also contributes to multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover certain union-represented employees. The plans provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain employees who meet eligibility requirements. Total Company contributions to multiemployer health and welfare plans were $58 million, $52 million and $60 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

10  Stock Incentive Plans 

Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the stock award (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method. The following table is a summary of stock-based compensation for each of the respective periods: 

(1) 

Includes the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP )     

(2) 

Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $38 million associated with accelerated vesting of restricted stock replacement awards issued to Omnicare executives who were terminated subsequent to the acquisition.     

The ESPP provides for the purchase of up to 30 million shares of common stock. Under the ESPP, beginning in 2016, eligible employees could purchase common stock at the end of each six month offering period at a purchase price equal to 90% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day or the last day of the offering period. Prior to 2016, the purchase price was equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day or the last day of the offering period. During 2017, approximately one million shares of common stock were purchased under the provisions of the ESPP at an average price of $71.66 per share. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 11 million shares of common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP. 

The fair value of stock-based compensation associated with the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant (the first day of the six month offering period) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 

The following table is a summary of the assumptions used to value the ESPP awards for each of the respective periods: 

(1) 

The dividend yield is calculated based on semi-annual dividends paid and the fair market value of the Company s stock at the grant date.     

(2) 

The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s daily stock market prices over the previous six month period.     

(3) 

The risk-free interest rate is based on the Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected term of ESPP options (i.e., six months).     

(4) 

The expected life is based on the semi-annual purchase period.     

The terms of the Company s Incentive Compensation Plan ( ICP ) provide for grants of annual incentive and long-term performance awards to executive officers and other officers and employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company. Payment of such annual incentive and long-term performance awards will be in cash, stock, other awards or other property, at the discretion of the Management Planning and Development Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. The ICP allows for a maximum of 74 million shares to be reserved and available for grants. The ICP is the only compensation plan under which the Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to its employees, with the exception of the Company s ESPP. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 32 million shares available for future grants under the ICP. 

The Company s restricted awards are considered nonvested share awards and require no payment from the employee. Compensation cost is recorded based on the market price of the Company s common stock on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2017, there was $350 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock units that are expected to vest. These costs are   

63 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.25 years. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $175 million, $218 million and $164 million, respectively. 

The following table is a summary of the restricted stock unit and restricted share award activity for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

All grants under the ICP are awarded at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock options granted generally become exercisable over a four-year period from the grant date. Stock options generally expire seven years after the grant date. 

Cash received from stock options exercised, which includes the ESPP, totaled $329 million, $296 million and $362 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Payments for taxes for net share settlement of equity awards totaled $71 million in 2017, $72 million in 2016 and $63 million in 2015, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $176 million, $244 million and $394 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $341 million, $298 million and $334 million, respectively. 

The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions at the time of grant: 

(1) 

The dividend yield is based on annual dividends paid and the fair market value of the Company s stock at the grant date.     

(2) 

The expected volatility is estimated using the Company s historical volatility over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant after adjustments for infrequent events such as stock splits.     

(3) 

The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options being valued.     

(4) 

The expected life represents the number of years the options are expected to be outstanding from grant date based on historical option holder exercise experience.     

As of December 31, 2017, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options totaled $57 million, which the Company expects to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.76 years. After considering anticipated forfeitures, the Company expects approximately 9 million of the unvested stock options to vest over the requisite service period.

The following table is a summary of the Company s stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2017: 

11  Income Taxes 

The income tax provision for continuing operations consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: 

On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  TCJA ). Among numerous changes to existing tax laws, the TCJA permanently reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018. The effects on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates are required to be taken into consideration in the period in which the changes are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. As the result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate under the TCJA, the Company estimated the revaluation of its net deferred tax liabilities and recorded a provisional income tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion for year ended December 31, 2017. The Company has not completed all of its processes to determine the TCJA s final impact. The final impact may differ from this provisional amount due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made thus far and the issuance of additional regulatory or other guidance. The accounting is expected to be completed by the time the 2017 federal corporate income tax return is filed in 2018. 

The following table is a reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the Company s effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the years ended December 31: 

65 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The Company has $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion of net deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following table is a summary of the components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31: 

The Company assesses positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not some portion of a deferred tax asset would not be realized. When it would not, a valuation allowance is established for such portion of a deferred tax asset. 

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

The Company and most of its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of numerous state and local jurisdictions. The Company is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process ( CAP ), which is a  program made available by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) to certain qualifying large taxpayers, under which participants work collaboratively with the IRS to identify and resolve potential tax issues through open, cooperative and transparent interaction prior to the annual filing of their federal income tax return. The IRS is currently examining the Company s 2016 and 2017 consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are also currently under income tax examinations by a number of state and local tax authorities. As of December 31, 2017, no examination has resulted in any proposed adjustments that would result in a material change to the Company s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 

Substantially all material state and local income tax matters have been concluded for fiscal years through 2011. Certain state exams are expected to/likely to be concluded and certain state statutes will lapse in 2018, but the change in the balance of our uncertain tax positions will be immaterial. In addition, it is reasonably possible that the Company s unrecognized tax benefits could change within the next twelve months due to the anticipated conclusion of various   

66 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

examinations with the IRS for various years. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time. 

The Company records interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense. The Company accrued interest expense of approximately $11 million in 2017, $10 million in 2016 and $5 million in 2015. The Company had approximately $34 million and $30 million accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

There are no material uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017 the ultimate deductibility of which is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing.  

As of December 31, 2017, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is approximately $317 million, after considering the federal benefit of state income taxes. 

12  Commitments and Contingencies 

Lease Guarantees 

Between 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob s Stores, Linens  n Things, and Marshalls. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the store s lease obligations. When the subsidiaries were disposed of and accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser has agreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries were to become insolvent and failed to make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy these obligations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company guaranteed approximately 85 such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens  n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2029. 

Legal Matters 

The Company is a party to legal proceedings, investigations and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including the matters described below. The Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability. None of the Company s accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company s financial position. 

Except as otherwise noted, the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, and is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for these matters. 

Indiana State District Council of Laborers and HOD Carriers Pension and Welfare Fund v. Omnicare, Inc.,   et al. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky). In February 2006, two substantially similar putative class action lawsuits were filed and subsequently consolidated. The consolidated complaint was filed against Omnicare, three of its officers and two of its directors and purported to be brought on behalf of all open-market purchasers of Omnicare common stock from August 3, 2005 through July 27, 2006, as well as all purchasers who bought shares of Omnicare common stock in Omnicare s public offering in December 2005. The complaint alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and sought, among other things, compensatory damages and injunctive relief. After dismissals and appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the United States Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court. In October 2016, Omnicare filed an answer to plaintiffs  third amended complaint, and      

67 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

discovery commenced. In August 2017, the plaintiffs moved for class certification, which Omnicare has opposed.     

FTC and Multi-State Investigation.   In March 2010, the Company learned that various State Attorneys General offices and certain other government agencies were conducting a multi-state investigation of certain of the Company s business practices similar to those being investigated at that time by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). Twenty-eight states, the District of Columbia and the County of Los Angeles are known to be participating in this investigation. The prior FTC investigation, which commenced in August 2009, was officially concluded in May 2012 when the consent order entered into between the FTC and the Company became final. The Company has cooperated with the multi-state investigation.     

United States   ex rel.   Jack Chin v. Walgreen Company,   et al. (U.S. District Court for the Central District of California). In March 2010, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General requesting information about programs under which the Company has offered customers remuneration conditioned upon the transfer of prescriptions for drugs or medications to the Company s pharmacies in the form of gift cards, cash, non-prescription merchandise or discounts or coupons for non-prescription merchandise. In October 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California unsealed a   qui tam   complaint, filed in April 2009 against CVS Pharmacy and other retail pharmacies, alleging that the Company violated the federal False Claims Act, and the False Claims Acts of several states, by offering such programs. The complaint was served on the Company in January 2017. In December 2017, the same court unsealed a second   qui tam   complaint filed by the same relator in September 2017. The complaint is based on the same factual allegations but asserts a legal theory the Court did not permit him to add to the original case. The federal government has declined intervention in both cases. The Company is defending both lawsuits.       

United States   ex rel.   Anthony R. Spay v. CVS Caremark Corporation,   et al. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In January 2012, the court unsealed a first amended   qui tam   complaint filed in August 2011 by an individual relator, Anthony Spay, who is described in the complaint as having once been employed by a firm providing pharmacy prescription benefit audit and recovery services. The complaint seeks monetary damages and alleges that CVS Caremark s processing of Medicare claims on behalf of one of its clients violated the federal False Claims Act. The United States declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In September 2015, the Court granted CVS Caremark s motion for summary judgment in its entirety, and entered judgment in favor of CVS Caremark and against Spay. Spay appealed. In December 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the court s judgment in favor of CVS Caremark.     

State of Texas   ex rel.   Myron Winkelman and Stephani Martinson,   et al.   v. CVS Health Corporation,   (Travis County Texas District Court). In February 2012, the Attorney General of the State of Texas issued Civil Investigative Demands and has issued a series of subsequent requests for documents and information in connection with its investigation concerning the CVS Health Savings Pass program and other pricing practices with respect to claims for reimbursement from the Texas Medicaid program. In January 2017, the court unsealed a first amended petition. The amended petition alleges the Company violated the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act by submitting false claims for reimbursement to Texas Medicaid by, among other things, failing to use the price available to members of the CVS Health Savings Pass program as the usual and customary price. The amended petition was unsealed following the Company s filing of   CVS Pharmacy, Inc. v. Charles Smith,   et al. (Travis County District Court), a declaratory judgment action against the State of Texas in December 2016 seeking a declaration that the prices charged to members of the CVS Health Savings Pass program do not constitute usual and customary prices under the Medicaid regulation. The State of Texas is also pursuing temporary injunctive relief.       

Subpoena Concerning PBM Administrative Fees.   In March 2014, the Company received a subpoena from the United States Attorney s Office for the     District of Rhode Island, requesting documents and information concerning bona fide service fees and rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in connection with certain drugs utilized under Medicare Part D, as well as the reporting of those fees and rebates to Part D plan      

68 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

sponsors. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the subpoena.     

Corcoran   et al.   v. CVS Health Corporation   (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) and   Podgorny   et al.   v. CVS Health Corporation   (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois). These putative class actions were filed against the Company in July and September 2015. The cases were consolidated in United States District Court in the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a class of consumers who purchased certain prescription drugs under the consumer protection statutes and common laws of certain states. Several third-party payors filed similar putative class actions on behalf of payors captioned   Sheet Metal Workers Local No. 20 Welfare and Benefit Fund v. CVS Health Corp.   and   Plumbers Welfare Fund, Local 130 v. CVS Health Corporation   (both pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island) in February and August 2016. In all of these cases the plaintiffs allege the Company overcharged for certain prescription drugs by not submitting the price available to members of the CVS Health Savings Pass program as the pharmacy s usual and customary price. In the consumer case (Corcoran), the Court granted summary judgment to CVS on plaintiffs  claims in their entirety and certified certain subclasses in September 2017. The plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The Company continues to defend these actions.      

Omnicare DEA Subpoena.   In September 2015, Omnicare was served with an administrative subpoena by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ). The subpoena seeks documents related to controlled substance policies, procedures, and practices at eight pharmacy locations from May 2012 to the present. In September 2017, the DEA expanded the investigation to include an additional pharmacy. The Company has been cooperating and providing documents in response to this administrative subpoena.     

Omnicare Cycle Fill Civil Investigative Demand.   In October 2015, Omnicare received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting information and documents concerning Omnicare s cycle fill process for assisted living facilities. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand. In July 2017, Omnicare also received a subpoena from the California Department of Insurance requesting documents on similar subject matter.      

PBM Pricing Civil Investigative Demand.   In October 2015, the Company received from the U.S. Department of Justice (the  DOJ ) a Civil Investigative Demand requesting documents and information in connection with a federal False Claims Act investigation concerning allegations that the Company submitted, or caused to be submitted, to the Medicare Part D program prescription drug event data that misrepresented true prices paid by the Company s PBM to pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company s PBM. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand.     

United States   ex rel.   Sally Schimelpfenig and John Segura v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc.   (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In November 2015, the court unsealed a second amended   qui tam   complaint filed in September 2015. The DOJ declined to intervene in this action. The relators allege that the Company, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, and Dr. Reddy s Laboratories violated the federal and various state False Claims Acts by dispensing prescriptions in unit dose packaging supplied by Dr. Reddy s that was not compliant with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act and the Poison Preventive Packaging Act and thereby allegedly rendering the drugs misbranded under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. In March 2017, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss with leave to file an amended complaint. In June 2017, the Company moved to dismiss relators  third amended complaint.     

Barchock   et al.   v. CVS Health Corporation,   et al. (U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island). In February 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, the Benefit Plans Committee of the Company, and Galliard Capital Management, Inc., by Mary Barchock, Thomas Wasecko, and Stacy Weller,      

69 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

purportedly on behalf of the 401(k) Plan and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of the Company (the  Plan ), and participants in the Plan. The complaint alleged that the defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiffs and the Plan by investing too much of the Plan s Stable Value Fund in short-term money market funds and cash management accounts. The court recently granted the Company s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs  amended complaint. In May 2017, plaintiffs appealed that ruling in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.     

State of California   ex rel.   Matthew Omlansky v. CVS Caremark Corporation   (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento). In April 2016, the court unsealed a first amended   qui tam   complaint filed in July 2013. The government has declined intervention in this case. The relator alleges that the Company submitted false claims for payment to California Medicaid in connection with reimbursement for drugs available through the CVS Health Savings Pass program as well as certain other generic drugs. The case has been stayed pending the relator s appeal of the judgment against him in a similar case against another retailer.     

Retail DEA Matters.   The Company has been also undergoing several audits by the DEA Administrator and is in discussions with the DEA and the U.S. Attorney s Offices in several locations concerning allegations that the Company has violated certain requirements of the Controlled Substance Act.     

National Opioid Litigation  . In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes, and third-party payors, alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is   In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation   (MDL No. 2804), pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes relevant federal court cases that name the Company, including actions filed by several counties in West Virginia; actions filed by several counties and cities in Michigan; actions filed by hospitals in Florida and Mississippi; and an action filed by the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Similar cases that name the Company in some capacity have been filed in state courts, including cases filed by Shelby County, Tennessee,   Shelby County (Tennessee) v. Purdue Pharma, L.P., et al.   (Shelby County Circuit Court, No. CT-004500-17), and several counties in West Virginia,   Brooke County (West Virginia) et al. v. Purdue Pharma, L.P., et al.   (Marshall County Circuit Court, Nos. 17-C-248   17-C-255). The Company is defending all such matters.     

Cherokee Nation Opioid Litigation  . In April 2017, the Company was named as a defendant in an action filed on behalf of the Cherokee Nation in the District Court of Cherokee Nation (the  Cherokee Action ) asserting various causes of action allegedly arising from the widespread abuse of opioids. In June 2017, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Cherokee Action. The Cherokee Nation has since filed an amended petition in the Cherokee Action. Also in June 2017, the six defendants in the Cherokee Action collectively filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma,   McKesson  , et al.   v. Hembree  , et al., seeking a declaration and preliminary injunction prohibiting the District Court of Cherokee Nation from exercising jurisdiction over the Cherokee Action. In January 2018, the U.S. District Court granted the preliminary injunction motion and issued an order enjoining the Cherokee Nation Attorney General and the judicial officers of the Cherokee Nation District Court from taking any action with respect to the Cherokee Action pending resolution of the federal court case.     

State of Mississippi v. CVS Health Corporation,   et al. (Chancery Court of DeSoto County, Mississippi, Third Judicial District). In July 2016, the Company was served with a complaint filed on behalf of the State of Mississippi alleging that CVS retail pharmacies in Mississippi submitted false claims for reimbursement to Mississippi Medicaid by not submitting the price available to members of the CVS Health Savings Pass program as the pharmacy s usual and customary price. The Company has responded to the complaint, filed a counterclaim, and moved to transfer the case to circuit court. The motion to transfer was granted, which the State has appealed, and the motion to dismiss remains pending.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Part B Insulin Products Civil Investigative Demand.   In December 2016, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Northern District of New York, requesting documents and information in connection with a False Claims Act investigation concerning whether the Company s retail pharmacies improperly submitted certain insulin claims to Medicare Part D rather than Part B. The Company has cooperated with the government and provided documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand.     

Cold Chain Logistics Civil Investigative Demand  . In September 2016, the Company received from the DOJ a Civil Investigative Demand in connection with an investigation as to whether the Company s handling of certain temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals violates the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the False Claims Act. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand.     

Amburgey,   et al.   v. CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C.   (U.S. District Court for the Central District of California). In March 2017, the Company was served with a complaint challenging the policies and procedures used by CVS Specialty pharmacies to ship temperature-sensitive medications. The case is similar to a matter already pending against the Company in the Superior Court of California (Los Angeles County),   Bertram v. Immunex Corp.  , et al., which was filed in October 2014. In November 2017, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the   Amburgey   case without prejudice. The Company continues to defend the Bertram matter.     

Barnett,   et al. v.   Novo Nordisk Inc  ., et al. and   Boss  , et al. v.   CVS Health Corporation  , et al., and   Christensen,   et al., v.   Novo Nordisk Inc.   et al., (all pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey). These putative class actions were filed against the Company and other PBMs and manufacturers of insulin in March and April 2017. Plaintiffs in all cases allege that the PBMs and manufacturers have engaged in a conspiracy whereby the PBMs sell access to their formularies by demanding the highest rebates, which in turn causes increased list prices for insulin. The primary claims are antitrust claims, claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ), violations of state unfair competition and consumer protection laws and in   Boss  , claims pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ). In December 2017, the attorney appointed as interim lead counsel in   Barnet, Boss   and   Christensen   filed a consolidated amended class action complaint in a related action,   In re Insulin Pricing Litigation  , against only the drug manufacturers, and not against the PBMs.     

Insulin Products Investigation.   In April 2017, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Attorney General of Washington, seeking documents and information regarding pricing and rebates for insulin products in connection with a pending investigation into unfair and deceptive acts or practice regarding insulin pricing. We have been notified by the Office of the Attorney General of Washington that information provided in response to the Civil Investigative Demand will be shared with the Attorneys General of California, Florida, Minnesota, New Mexico and the District of Columbia. In July 2017, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Attorney General of Minnesota, seeking documents and information regarding pricing and rebates for insulin and epinephrine products in connection with a pending investigation into unfair and deceptive acts or practices regarding insulin and epinephrine pricing.     

Bewley,   et al. v.   CVS Health Corporation  , et al. and   Prescott  , et al. v.   CVS Health Corporation  , et al. (both pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington). These putative class actions were filed in May 2017 against the Company and other pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers of glucagon kits (Bewley) and diabetes test strips (Prescott).     Both cases allege that, by contracting for rebates with the manufacturers of these diabetes products, the Company and other PBMs caused list prices for these products to increase, thereby harming certain consumers. The primary claims are made under federal antitrust laws, RICO, state unfair competition and consumer protection laws, and ERISA. These cases have both been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on defendants  motions. The Company is defending these lawsuits.

Klein  , et al. v.   Prime Therapeutics  , et al.   (U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota). In June 2017, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company and other pharmacy benefit managers on behalf of ERISA plan members who purchased and paid for EpiPen or EpiPen Jr. Plaintiffs allege that the pharmacy benefit managers are ERISA fiduciaries to plan members and have violated ERISA by allegedly causing higher inflated prices for EpiPen through the process of negotiating increased rebates from EpiPen manufacturer, Mylan. The Company is defending this lawsuit.     

Medicare Part D Civil Investigative Demand  . In May 2017, the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York issued a Civil Investigative Demand to the Company concerning possible false claims submitted to Medicare in connection with reimbursements for prescription drugs under the Medicare Part D program. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to the Civil Investigative Demand.     

Shareholder Matters.   In August and September 2017, four complaints were filed by putative derivative plaintiffs against certain officers and directors of the Company. Three of those actions,   Sherman v. Merlo,   et al.,   Feghali v. Merlo,   et al., and   Banchalter v. Merlo,   et al., were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. A fourth,   Boron v. Bracken,   et al., was filed in Rhode Island Superior Court. These matters assert a variety of causes of action, including breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy and violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and are premised on the allegation that the defendants approved business plans that exposed the Company to various litigations and investigations. The three federal matters have been stayed pending resolution of certain of the underlying matters, and the Company has filed a motion to stay the state court action.     

MSP Recovery Claims Series, LLC  , et al. v.   CVS Health Corporation  , et al. (U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas). In September 2017, a putative class action complaint was filed against the company, Express Scripts, Inc., and the manufacturers of insulin on behalf of assignees of claims of Medicare Advantage Organizations. Plaintiffs assert that the PBMs and manufacturers have engaged in a conspiracy whereby the PBMs sell access to their formularies by demanding the highest rebates, which in turn causes increased list prices for insulin. The plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of two putative classes: (1) all Medicare C payors and (2) all Medicare D payors. The complaint asserts claims under RICO, and for common law fraud and unjust enrichment.     

The Company is also a party to other legal proceedings, government investigations, inquiries and audits, and has received and is cooperating with subpoenas or similar process from various governmental agencies requesting information, all arising in the normal course of its business, none of which is expected to be material to the Company. The Company can give no assurance, however, that its business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected, or that the Company will not be required to materially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations as they may relate to the Company s business, the pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industries or to the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of the Company s business or the pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally; (iv) pending or future government enforcement actions against the Company; (v) adverse developments in any pending   qui tam   lawsuit against the Company, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future   qui tam   lawsuit that may be filed against the Company; or (vi) adverse developments in pending or future legal proceedings against the Company or affecting the pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy, retail pharmacy, long-term care pharmacy or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally.

13  Segment Reporting 

The Company currently has three reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate. The Retail/LTC Segment includes the operating results of the Company s Retail Pharmacy and LTC/RxCrossroads operating segments as the operations and economics characteristics are similar. The Company s segments maintain separate financial information for which operating results are evaluated on a regular basis by the Company s chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 

The Company evaluates its Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments  performance based on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate Segment based on operating expenses before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources, therefore the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included. See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies  for a description of the Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate segments and related significant accounting policies. 

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 12.3%, 11.7% and 10.0%, respectively, of the Company s consolidated net revenues were from Aetna, a Pharmacy Services Segment client. More than 99% of the Company s consolidated net revenues are earned in, and long-lived assets are located in the United States. 

73 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table is a reconciliation of the Company s business segments to the consolidated financial statements: 

(5) 

Net revenues of the Pharmacy Services Segment include approximately $10.8 billion, $10.5 billion and $8.9 billion of Retail Co-Payments for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Retail Co-Payments.     

(6) 

Intersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services Segment and the Retail/LTC Segment. These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients ( members ) fill prescriptions at the Company s retail pharmacies to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice      elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company s retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at the Company s long-term care pharmacies. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis.     

(7) 

The Retail/LTC Segment gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 includes $2 million and $46 million, respectively of acquisition-related integration costs. The integration costs in 2017 are related to the acquisition of Omnicare and the integration costs in 2016 are related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.     

(8) 

The Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $215 million of charges associated with store closures and $181 million of goodwill impairment charges related to its RxCrossroads reporting unit. The Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a $34 million asset impairment charge in connection with planned store closures in 2017 related to the Company s enterprise streamlining initiative. The Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, include $34 million, $281 million and $64 million, respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs. The integration costs in 2017 are related to the acquisition of Omnicare and the integration costs in 2016 are related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.     

(9) 

The Corporate Segment operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a $3 million reduction in integration costs for a change in estimate related to the acquisition of Omnicare. In addition, the Corporate Segment operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $34 million in acquisition-related transaction costs related to the proposed Aetna acquisition and $9 million of transaction costs related to the divestiture of RxCrossroads. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Corporate Segment operating loss includes $10 million of integration costs related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Corporate Segment operating loss includes $156 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. The Corporate Segment operating loss for 2015 also includes a $90 million charge related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 legal settlement by MedPartners of various securities class actions and a related derivative claim.     

(10) 

The Pharmacy Services Segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the reversal of an accrual of $88 million in connection with a legal settlement.     

(11) 

Amounts revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07,   Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost  , which increased consolidated operating profit by $28 and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the  consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 14, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

/s/ Ernst   Young LLP 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2007.
