     Government Supervision and Regulation 
  The following discussion describes, among other things, elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies, financial holding companies and banks, including specific information about Bank of America. U.S. federal regulation of banks, bank holding companies and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors. For additional information about recent regulatory programs, initiatives and legislation that impact us, see   Regulatory Matters   in the MD A on page   66  . 
  General 
  We are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies, financial holding companies and banks. 
  As a registered financial holding company and bank holding company, Bank of America Corporation is subject to the supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Our banking subsidiaries (the Banks) organized as national banking associations are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) regulates consumer financial products and services. 
  U.S. financial holding companies, and the companies under their control, are permitted to engage in activities considered  financial in nature  as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. Unless otherwise limited by the Federal Reserve, a financial holding company may engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature provided the financial holding company gives the Federal Reserve after-the-fact notice of the new activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also permits national banks to engage in activities considered financial in nature through a financial subsidiary, subject to certain conditions and limitations and with the approval of the OCC. If the Federal Reserve finds that any of the Banks is not  well-capitalized  or  well-managed,  we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. 
  The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits bank holding companies to acquire banks located in states other than their home state without regard to state law, subject to certain conditions, including the condition that the bank holding company, after and as a result of the acquisition, controls no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act) restricts acquisitions by financial companies if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10 percent of the total liabilities of all financial companies. At December 31, 2011, we held approximately 12 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. 
  We are also subject to various other laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our operations and  

management and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our U.S. broker/dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation by and supervision of the SEC, New York Stock Exchange and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; our commodities businesses in the U.S. are subject to regulation by and supervision of the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); and our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies. 
  Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. Our financial services operations in the U.K. are subject to regulation by and supervision of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). In July of 2010, the U.K. proposed abolishing the FSA and replacing it with the Financial Policy Committee within the Bank of England (FPC) and two new regulators, the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Consumer Protection and Markets Authority (CPMA). Our U.K. regulated entities will be subject to the supervision of the FPC and the PRA for prudential matters and the CPMA for conduct of business matters. The new financial regulatory structure is intended to be in place by the end of 2012. We continue to monitor the development and potential impact of this regulatory restructuring. 
  Financial Reform Act 
  On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. As a result of the Financial Reform Act, several significant regulatory developments occurred in 2011, and additional regulatory developments may occur in 2012 and beyond. The Financial Reform Act has had, and will continue to have, a significant and negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and new restrictions. For a description of significant developments see   Regulatory Matters   in the MD A on page   66  .  
  Capital and Operational Requirements 
  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions ( well-capitalized,   adequately capitalized,   undercapitalized,   significantly undercapitalized  and  critically undercapitalized ) and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for  prompt corrective action  for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital-raising requirements. An  undercapitalized  bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank s compliance with the plan.  
  As a financial services holding company, we are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve (Basel I) and risk-based capital guidelines issued by other U.S. banking regulators. Under these guidelines, we measure capital adequacy based on Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital and Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital). Capital ratios are calculated by dividing each capital amount by risk-weighted assets. Under Basel I, the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio is four percent and the minimum total capital ratio is eight percent. A  well-capitalized  institution must generally  

Table of Contents  

     maintain capital ratios an additional two percentage points higher than these minimum guidelines.  
  While not an explicit requirement of law or regulation, bank regulatory agencies have stated that they expect common equity to be the primary component of a financial holding company s Tier 1 capital and that financial holding companies should maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio of at least four percent.  
  The Tier 1 leverage ratio is determined by dividing Tier 1 capital by adjusted quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments.  Well-capitalized  bank holding companies must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent and not be subject to a Federal Reserve directive to maintain higher capital levels.  Well-capitalized  national banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least five percent and not be subject to a Federal Reserve directive to maintain higher capital levels. We are currently classified as  well-capitalized  under Basel I. 
  The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II) was published in December 2007 and established requirements for U.S. implementation of Basel II and provided detailed requirements for a new regulatory capital framework. This regulatory capital framework includes requirements related to credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). We are currently in the Basel II parallel period. 
  On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) issued  Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems  (Basel III), proposing a January 2013 implementation date for Basel III. If implemented by U.S. banking regulators as proposed, Basel III could significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing that the disqualification be phased in from 2013 through 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (including deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others, within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) in capital, increased capital requirements for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements. The phase-in period for the capital deductions is proposed to occur in 20 percent increments from 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by December 31, 2018. An increase in capital requirements for counterparty credit is proposed to be effective January 2013. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur between 2013 and 2019. U.S. banking regulators have not yet issued proposed regulations that will implement these requirements.  
  On December 29, 2011, U.S. regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) that would amend a December 2010 NPR on the Market Risk Rules. This amended NPR is expected to increase the capital requirements for our trading assets and liabilities. We continue to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules and currently anticipate that we will be in compliance with any final rules by the projected implementation date in late 2012.    
  On June 17, 2011, U.S. banking regulators proposed rules requiring all large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit a comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The proposed regulations require BHCs to demonstrate adequate capital to support planned capital actions, such as dividends,  

share repurchases or other forms of distributing capital. CCAR submissions are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may require BHCs to provide prior notice under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution. 
  On July 19, 2011, the Basel Committee published the consultative document  Globally systemic important banks: Assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement  which sets out measures for global, systemically important financial institutions including the methodology for measuring systemic importance, the additional capital required (the SIFI buffer), and the arrangements by which they will be phased in. As proposed, the SIFI buffer would be met with additional Tier 1 common equity ranging from   one percent   to   2.5 percent  , and in certain circumstances,   3.5 percent  . This will be phased in from 2016 through 2018. U.S. banking regulators have not yet provided similar rules for U.S. implementation of a SIFI buffer. 
  In addition to the capital proposals, in December 2010 the Basel Committee proposed two measures of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) identifies the amount of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets a financial institution holds that can be used to offset the net cash outflows the institution would encounter under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liability arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations, over a one-year period. These two minimum liquidity measures are also considered part of Basel III. 
  Given that the U.S. regulatory agencies have issued neither proposed rulemaking nor supervisory guidance on Basel III, significant uncertainty exists regarding the ultimate impacts of Basel III on U.S. financial institutions, including us.

  Distributions 
  We are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. For instance, under proposed rules we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve a capital plan as part of an annual CCAR (the Capital Plan). Supervisory review of the CCAR has a stated purpose of assessing the capital planning process of major U.S. bank holding companies, including any planned capital actions such as the payment of dividends on common stock. For additional information regarding the restrictions on our ability to receive dividends or other distributions from the Banks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
  In addition, our ability to pay dividends is affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non-capital standards established under FDICIA, as described above. The right  

Bank of America         3 

Table of Contents  

     of the Corporation, our stockholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries. 
  For additional information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital requirements, see   Note 15   Shareholders  Equity   and   Note 18   Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Source of Strength 
  According to the Financial Reform Act and Federal Reserve policy, bank holding companies are expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the FDICIA, in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC - either as a result of default of a banking subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default - the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC s loss, subject to certain exceptions. For additional information about our calculation of regulatory capital and capital composition, and proposed capital rules, see   Capital Management   Regulatory Capital   in the MD A on page   72  , and   Note 18   Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Deposit Insurance 
  Deposits placed at U.S. domiciled Banks (U.S. Banks) are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to $250,000 per customer. The Financial Reform Act also provides for unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts for a two-year period beginning on December 31, 2010 and ending on January 1, 2013. All insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the DIF.  
  The FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. The Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to assess insured depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. The FDIC has adopted new regulations that establish a long-term target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. The DIF ratio is currently below the required targets and the FDIC has adopted a restoration plan that will result in substantially higher deposit insurance assessments for all depository institutions over the coming years. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. For additional information regarding deposit insurance, see   Item 1A. Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risk   on page   14   and   Regulatory Matters   Financial Reform Act   and   Regulatory Matters   FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments   in the MD A on pages   66   and   67  .  
  Transactions with Affiliates 
  U.S. Banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit certain types of transactions between the Banks and their non-bank affiliates. In general, U.S. Banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving Bank of America and its non-bank affiliates. Transactions between the U.S. Banks and their  

non-bank affiliates are required to be on arm s length terms. For additional information regarding transactions with affiliates, see   Regulatory Matters   Transactions with Affiliates   in the MD A on page   68  . 
  Privacy and Information Security 
  We are subject to many U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect the non-public confidential information of our customers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Banks to periodically disclose Bank of America s privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to market to affiliates and non-affiliates under certain circumstances. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires the Banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. 
    Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The following discussion addresses the most significant factors that could affect our businesses, operations and financial condition. Additional factors that could affect our financial condition and operations are discussed in Forward-looking Statements in the MD A on page   25  . However, other factors could also adversely affect our businesses, operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face. 
  General Economic and Market Conditions Risk 
  Our businesses and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the U.S. and international financial markets and economic conditions generally. 
  Our businesses and results of operations are materially affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, European sovereign debt risks and the strength of the U.S. economy and the non-U.S. economies in which we operate. The deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses and securities portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels and liquidity, and our results of operations. 
  Although the U.S. economy continued its modest recovery in 2011, elevated unemployment, under-employment and household debt, along with continued stress in the consumer real estate market and certain commercial real estate markets, pose  

Table of Contents  

     challenges for domestic economic performance and the financial services industry. The sustained high unemployment rate and the lengthy duration of unemployment have directly impaired consumer finances and pose risks to the financial services industry. The housing market remains weak and elevated levels of distressed and delinquent mortgages pose further risks to the housing market. In addition, the public perception of certain financial services firms and practices appeared to decline during 2011. The current environment of heightened scrutiny of financial institutions has resulted in increased public awareness of and sensitivity to banking fees and practices. Mortgage and housing market-related risks may be accentuated by attempts to forestall foreclosure proceedings, as well as state and federal investigations into foreclosure practices by mortgage servicers. Each of these factors may adversely affect our fees and costs. 
  For additional information about economic conditions and challenges discussed above, see   Executive Summary   2011 Economic and Business Environment   in the MD A on page   27  . 
  Mortgage and Housing Market-Related Risk 
  We have been, and expect to continue to be, required to repurchase mortgage loans and/or reimburse government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (collectively, the GSEs) and monolines for losses due to claims related to representations and warranties made in connection with sales of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and mortgage loans, and have received similar claims, and may receive additional claims, from whole-loan purchasers, private-label securitization investors and private-label securitization trustees, monolines and others. The ultimate resolution of these exposures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. 
  In connection with residential mortgage loans sold to GSEs and first-lien residential mortgage and home equity loans sold to investors other than GSEs, we or our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in a requirement that we repurchase mortgage loans, or indemnify or provide other remedies to counterparties (collectively, repurchases). The Corporation and legacy Countrywide sold approximately $1.1 trillion of loans originated from 2004 through 2008 to the GSEs. In addition, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold loans originated from 2004 through 2008 with an original principal balance of $963 billion to investors other than GSEs. 
  The amount of our total unresolved repurchase claims from all sources totaled approximately $14.3 billion at December 31, 2011. The total amount of our recorded liability related to representations and warranties repurchase exposure was $15.9 billion at December 31, 2011.  
  Our estimated liability at December 31, 2011 for obligations under representations and warranties with respect to GSE exposures is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, our historical claims experience with the GSEs. It includes our understanding of our agreements with the GSEs and projections of future defaults, as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. The GSEs  repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with the GSEs  own past conduct and our interpretation of our contractual obligations. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding  

from the GSEs. We are not able to predict changes in the behavior of the GSEs based on our past experiences. Therefore, it is not possible to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to any such potential impact in excess of current accrued liabilities. 
  Beginning in February 2012, we are no longer delivering purchase money and non-Making Home Affordable Program (MHA) refinance first-lien residential mortgage products into FNMA mortgage-backed securities (MBS) pools because of the expiration and mutual non-renewal of certain contractual delivery commitments and variances that permit efficient delivery of such loans to FNMA. While we continue to have a valid agreement with FNMA permitting the delivery of purchase money and non-MHA refinance first-lien residential mortgage products without such contractual delivery commitments and variances, the delivery of such products without such contractual variances would involve time and expense to implement the necessary operational and systems changes and otherwise present practical operational issues. The non-renewal of these contractual delivery commitments and variances was influenced, in part, by our ongoing differences with FNMA in other contexts, including repurchase claims. We continue to deliver MHA refinancing products into FNMA MBS pools, and continue to engage in dialogue to attempt to address these differences. 
  While we are seeking to resolve our differences with the GSEs concerning each party s interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, whether we will be able to achieve a resolution of these differences on acceptable terms and timing thereof, is subject to significant uncertainty. 
  In addition to repurchase claims, we receive notices from mortgage insurance (MI) companies of claim denials, cancellations, or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices) and the amount of such notices have remained elevated. As of December 31, 2011, 74 percent of the MI rescission notices received had not been resolved. On June 30, 2011, FNMA issued an announcement requiring servicers to report, effective October 1, 2011, all MI rescission notices with respect to loans sold to FNMA. The announcement also confirmed FNMA s view of its position that a mortgage insurance company s issuance of a MI rescission notice constitutes a breach of the lender s representations and warranties and permits FNMA to require the lender to repurchase the mortgage loan or promptly remit a make-whole payment covering FNMA s loss even if the lender is contesting the mortgage insurer s rescission. We have informed FNMA that we do not believe that the new policy is valid under our relevant contracts with FNMA and that we do not intend to repurchase loans under the terms set forth in the new policy. If we are required to abide by the terms of the new FNMA policy, our representations and warranties liability will likely increase.  
  Our estimated liability and range of possible loss with respect to non-GSE exposures is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, our historical claims and settlement experience with non-GSE counterparties and may materially change in the future based on factors beyond our control. Future provisions and/or estimated ranges of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from our assumptions in our predictive models, including, without limitation, those regarding ultimate resolution of the Bank of New York Mellon settlement (BNY Mellon Settlement), estimated repurchase rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, and a variety of other judgmental factors. In addition, we have not recorded any  

Bank of America         5 

Table of Contents  

     representations and warranties liability for certain potential monoline exposures and certain potential whole-loan and other private-label securitization exposures. We currently estimate that the range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of December 31, 2011 could be up to $5.0 billion over existing accruals. Reserves for certain potential monoline exposure are considered in our litigation reserves. This estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss, is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change, including the assumption that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement are satisfied. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for non-GSE representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and our estimated range of possible loss.  
  If future representations and warranties losses occur in excess of our recorded liability for GSE exposures and in excess of our recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE exposures, including as a result of the factors set forth above, such losses could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The liability for obligations under representations and warranties with respect to GSE and non-GSE exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposures do not include any losses related to litigation matters disclosed in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  , nor do they include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs, assessments and compensatory fees or any possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations (except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon settlement), potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against us, including claims related to loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities law (except to the extent reflected in the aggregate range of possible loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ), fraud or other claims against us; however, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. 
  For additional information about our representations and warranties exposure, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Representations and Warranties   in the MD A on page   56  ,   Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management   in the MD A on page   81   and   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  If final court approval is not obtained with respect to the BNY Mellon Settlement to resolve nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE RMBS repurchase exposures of the 2004-2008 vintages, or if the Corporation and legacy Countrywide determine to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, the Corporation s future representations and warranties losses could be substantially higher than existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals, and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. 

The BNY Mellon Settlement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions. It is not currently possible to predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. There can be no assurance that final court approval of the settlement will be obtained, that all conditions will be satisfied (including the receipt of private letter rulings from the IRS and other tax rulings and opinions) or that, if certain conditions in the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, the Corporation and legacy Countrywide will not determine to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement. 
  If final court approval is not obtained with respect to the BNY Mellon Settlement or if the Corporation and legacy Countrywide determine to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement in accordance with its terms, the Corporation s future representations and warranties losses with respect to non-GSEs could substantially exceed our non-GSE reserve, together with estimated reasonably possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure of up to $5.0 billion over existing accruals at December 31, 2011. Developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties (including the timing and ultimate outcome of the court approval process relating to the BNY Mellon Settlement) could result in significant increases in our non-GSE reserve and/or to this estimated range of possible loss, and such increases could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Representations and Warranties in the MD A on page   56  . 
  Further weakness in the U.S. housing market, including home prices, may adversely affect our consumer portfolios and have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Economic weakness in 2011 was accompanied by continued stress in the U.S. housing market, including declines in home prices. These declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and elevated foreclosures, have negatively impacted the demand for many of our products and the credit performance of our consumer mortgage portfolios. Additionally, our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market, which has declined due to reduced activity in the housing market. Continued high unemployment rates in the U.S. have challenged U.S. consumers and further compounded these stresses in the U.S. housing market as employment conditions may be compelling some consumers to delay new home purchases or miss payments on existing mortgages. 
  Conditions in the U.S. housing market have also resulted in significant write-downs of asset values in several asset classes, notably MBS and exposure to monolines. These conditions may negatively affect the value of real estate which could negatively affect our exposure to representations and warranties. While there were continued indications throughout the past year that the U.S. economy is stabilizing, the performance of our overall consumer portfolios may not significantly improve in the near future. A protracted continuation or worsening of these difficult housing market conditions may exacerbate the adverse effects outlined above and have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

     We temporarily suspended our foreclosure sales nationally in 2010 to conduct an assessment of our foreclosure processes. Subsequently, numerous state and federal investigations of foreclosure processes across our industry have been initiated. Those investigations and any irregularities that might be found in our foreclosure processes, along with any remedial steps taken in response to governmental investigations or to our own internal assessment, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  
  We have resumed foreclosure sales in nearly all states where foreclosure does not require a court order (non-judicial states). While we have resumed foreclosure proceedings in nearly all states where a court order is required (judicial states), our progress on foreclosure sales in judicial states has been much slower than in non-judicial states. The pace of foreclosure sales in judicial states increased significantly by the fourth quarter of 2011. However, there continues to be a backlog of foreclosure inventory in judicial states. 
  The implementation of changes in procedures and controls, including loss mitigation procedures related to our ability to recover on FHA insurance-related claims, and governmental, regulatory and judicial actions, may result in continuing delays in foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales and create obstacles to the collection of certain fees and expenses, in both judicial and non-judicial foreclosures. 
  We entered into a consent order with the Federal Reserve and Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) entered into a consent order with the OCC on April 13, 2011. The OCC consent order required that we retain an independent consultant, approved by the OCC, to conduct a review of all foreclosure actions pending, or foreclosure sales that occurred, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010, and submit a plan to the OCC to remediate all financial injury to borrowers caused by any deficiencies identified through the review. The review is comprised of two parts: a sample file review conducted by the independent consultant, which began in October 2011, and file reviews by the independent consultant based upon requests for review from customers with in-scope foreclosures. We began outreach to those customers in November 2011 and additional outreach efforts are underway. Because the review process is available to a large number of potentially eligible borrowers and involves an examination of many details and documents, each review could take several months to complete. We cannot yet determine how many borrowers will ultimately request a review, how many borrowers will meet the eligibility requirements or how much in compensation might ultimately be paid to eligible borrowers. 
  We continue to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current servicing and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the Servicing Resolution Agreements, defined below. This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny has the potential to subject us to inquiries or investigations that could significantly adversely affect our reputation. Such investigations by state and federal authorities, as well as any other governmental or regulatory scrutiny of our foreclosure processes, could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies, additional default servicing requirements and process changes, or other enforcement actions, and could result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental  

investigations and additional litigation and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. 
  We expect that mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, including compensatory fees assessed by the GSEs and other costs associated with foreclosures will remain elevated as additional loans are delayed in the foreclosure process. This will likely result in continued higher noninterest expense, including higher default servicing costs and legal expenses in   CRES  . In addition, required process changes, including those required under the consent orders with federal bank regulators, are likely to result in further increases in our default servicing costs over the longer term. Delays in foreclosure sales may result in additional costs associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home price declines, result in a greater number of nonperforming loans and increased servicing advances and may adversely impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our MSR asset, MBS and real estate owned properties. With respect to GSE MBS, the valuation of certain MBS could be negatively affected under certain scenarios due to changes in the timing of cash flows. With respect to non-GSE MBS, under certain scenarios the timing and amount of cash flows could be negatively affected. For additional information regarding the temporary suspension of our foreclosure sales, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Other Mortgage-related Matters in the MD A on page   63  . 
  We reached an agreement in principle (AIP) with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), various federal agencies and 49 state attorneys general, to resolve various investigations into our foreclosure, servicing and certain mortgage origination practices. We also reached an agreement in principle with the FHA to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans and agreements in principle with the Federal Reserve and OCC regarding civil monetary penalties. These agreements are subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and the completion and execution of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. Failure to finalize the documentation or to obtain the required approvals with respect to these agreements in principle, and failure to meet certain borrower assistance and refinancing assistance commitment goals in the agreements in principle which would trigger additional monetary payments and exposure to claims not covered by the agreements in principle, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  
  On February 9, 2012, we reached agreements in principle (collectively, the Servicing Resolution Agreements) with (1) the DOJ, various federal regulatory agencies and 49 attorneys general to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination, servicing and foreclosure practices (the Global AIP), (2) the FHA to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily by Countrywide prior to and for a period following our acquisition of that lender (the FHA AIP) and (3) each of the Federal Reserve and the OCC regarding civil monetary penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011 (the Consent Order AIPs).  
  The Servicing Resolution Agreements are subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and completion and execution of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. The Global AIP is subject to, among other things, Federal court approval in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia and regulatory approvals of the United States  

Bank of America         7 

Table of Contents  

     Department of the Treasury and other federal agencies. The Consent Order AIPs are subject to, among other things, the finalization of the Global AIP. There can be no assurance as to when or whether binding settlement agreements will be reached, that they will be on terms consistent with the agreements in principle, or as to when or whether the necessary approvals will be obtained and the settlements will be finalized. 
  The Global AIP calls for the establishment of certain uniform servicing standards, upfront cash payments of approximately $1.9 billion to the state and federal governments and for borrower restitution, approximately $7.6 billion in borrower assistance in the form of, among other things, principal reduction, short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and approximately $1.0 billion in refinancing assistance. We could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet our borrower assistance and refinancing assistance commitments over a three-year period. In addition, we could be required to pay an additional $350 million if we fail to meet certain first-lien principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period. We also entered into agreements with several states under which we committed to perform certain minimum levels of principal reduction and related activities within those states as part of the Global AIP, and under which we could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet such minimum levels. We expect to recognize the refinancing assistance as lower interest income in future periods as qualified borrowers pay reduced interest rates on loans refinanced. We may also incur additional operating costs (e.g., servicing costs) to implement certain terms of the Global AIP in future periods.  
  The FHA AIP provides for an upfront cash payment by us of $500 million. We would have the obligation to pay an additional $500 million if we fail to meet certain principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period.  
  Pursuant to an agreement in principle, the OCC agreed to hold in abeyance the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of $164 million. Pursuant to a separate agreement in principle, the Federal Reserve will assess a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $176 million against us. Satisfying our payment, borrower assistance and remediation obligations under the Global AIP will satisfy any civil monetary penalty obligations arising under these agreements in principle. If, however, we do not make certain required payments or undertake certain required actions under the Global AIP, the OCC will assess, and the Federal Reserve will require us to pay, the difference between the aggregate value of the payments and actions under these agreements in principle and the penalty amounts.  
  The Servicing Resolution Agreements do not cover claims arising out of securitization (including representations made to investors respecting MBS), criminal claims, private claims by borrowers, claims by certain states for injunctive relief or actual economic damages to borrowers related to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), and claims by the GSEs (including repurchase demands), among other items. Failure to finalize the documentation related to the Servicing Resolution Agreements, to obtain the required court and regulatory approvals, to meet our borrower and refinancing commitments or other adverse developments with respect to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer in the residential mortgage securitization process, including obligations related to residential mortgage foreclosure actions, along with other losses we could incur in our capacity as servicer, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  
  Bank of America and its legacy companies have securitized a significant portion of the residential mortgage loans that they have originated or acquired. The Corporation services a large portion of the loans it or its subsidiaries have securitized and also services loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. In addition to identifying specific servicing criteria, pooling and servicing arrangements entered into in connection with a securitization or whole loan sale typically impose standards of care on the servicer, with respect to its activities, that may include the obligation to adhere to the accepted servicing practices of prudent mortgage lenders and/or to exercise the degree of care and skill that the servicer employs when servicing loans for its own account.  
  Many non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securitizations and whole-loan servicing agreements also require us to indemnify the trustee or other investor for or against failures by us to perform our servicing obligations or acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, our duties. Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. Each GSE typically claims the right to demand that we repurchase loans that breach the seller s representations and warranties made in connection with the initial sale of the loans, even if we were not the seller. The GSEs also claim that they have the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches. The GSEs  first mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary, and purport to require the imposition of compensatory fees if those deadlines are not satisfied except for reasons beyond our control. We believe that the governing contracts, our course of dealing and collective past practices and understandings should inform resolution of these matters. Beginning in 2010, the GSEs increased the level of compensatory fees imposed and have recently amended those servicing guides retroactively to impose significantly new and more stringent requirements relating to default activities, which could increase our exposure to claims for compensatory fees. We have informed the GSEs that we do not believe that the new policies, or their retroactive application, are valid under the relevant contracts, and that we do not agree that the newly articulated policies are the proper method for the assessment of any compensatory fees under the terms of the relevant contracts. 
  With regard to alleged irregularities in foreclosure process-related activities referred to above, we may incur costs or losses if we elect or are required to re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may also incur costs or losses if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower, or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process. These costs and liabilities may not be reimbursable to us. We may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures. We may be subject to deductions by insurers for MI or guarantee benefits relating to delays or alleged deficiencies. Additionally, if we commit a material breach of our servicing obligations that is not cured within specified timeframes,

     including those related to default servicing and foreclosure, we could be terminated as servicer under servicing agreements under certain circumstances. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or increase our servicing costs. 
  Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce mortgages loans. There has been significant public commentary regarding the common industry practice of recording mortgages in the name of MERS, as nominee on behalf of the note holder, and whether securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens securing those loans. We currently use the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been sold to investors or securitization trusts. A component of the OCC consent order requires significant changes in the manner in which we service loans identifying MERS as the mortgagee. Additionally, certain local and state governments have commenced legal actions against us, MERS, and other MERS members, questioning the validity of the MERS model. Other challenges have also been made to the process for transferring mortgage loans to securitization trusts, asserting that having a mortgagee of record that is different than the holder of the mortgage note could  break the chain of title  and cloud the ownership of the loan. In order to foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it may be necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to be made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a mortgage held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be completed by a MERS signing officer. As such, our practice is to obtain assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to instituting foreclosure. If certain required documents are missing or defective, or if the use of MERS is found not to be valid, we could be obligated to cure certain defects or in some circumstances be subject to additional costs and expenses. Our use of MERS as nominee for the mortgage may also create reputational and other risks for us. 
  These costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We may also face negative reputational costs from these servicing risks, which could reduce our future business opportunities in this area or cause that business to be on less favorable terms to us.  
  For additional information concerning our servicing risks, see   Recent Events   in the MD A on page   28  .

  Liquidity Risk 
  Liquidity Risk is the Potential Inability to Meet Our Contractual and Contingent Financial Obligations, On- or Off-balance Sheet, as they Become Due. 
  Adverse changes to our credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, competitive position, financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting our access to funding or the capital markets, increasing our borrowing costs, or triggering additional collateral or funding requirements. 
  Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain  

transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies which consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control.  
  On December 15, 2011, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the Corporation s and BANA s long-term and short-term debt ratings as a result of Fitch s decision to lower its  support floor  for systemically important U.S. financial institutions. On November 29, 2011, Standard   Poor s Ratings Services (S P) downgraded the Corporation s long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANA s long-term debt rating as a result of S P s implementation of revised methodologies for determining Banking Industry Country Risk Assessments and bank ratings. On September 21, 2011, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s) downgraded the Corporation s long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANA s long-term debt rating as a result of Moody s lowering the amount of uplift for potential U.S. government support it incorporates into ratings. On February 15, 2012, Moody s placed the Corporation s long-term debt ratings and BANA s long-term and short-term debt ratings on review for possible downgrade as part of its review of financial institutions with global capital markets operations. Any adjustment to our ratings will be determined based on Moody s review; however, the agency offered guidance that downgrades to our ratings, if any, would likely be limited to one notch. 
  Currently, the Corporation s long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies are as follows: Baa1/P-2 (negative) by Moody  A-/A-2 (negative) by S  and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. The rating agencies could make further adjustments to our credit ratings at any time. There can be no assurance that additional downgrades will not occur. 
  A further reduction in certain of our credit ratings may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker/dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing, and the effect on our incremental cost of funds and earnings could be material. 
  In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of a further downgrade of our credit ratings or certain subsidiaries  credit ratings, counterparties to those agreements may require us or certain subsidiaries to provide additional collateral, terminate these contracts or agreements, or provide other remedies. At December 31, 2011, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for us or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements would have been approximately   $1.6 billion   comprised of   $1.2 billion   for BANA and   $375 million   for Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) and certain of its subsidiaries. If the agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for these entities by a second incremental notch, approximately   $1.1 billion   in additional collateral, comprised of   $871 million   for BANA and   $269 million   for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries, would have been required. 

Bank of America         9

     Also, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for us or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2011 was   $2.9 billion  , against which   $2.7 billion   of collateral had been posted. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for us or certain subsidiaries a second incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2011 was an incremental   $5.6 billion  , against which   $5.4 billion   of collateral had been posted. 
  While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full consequences of a credit ratings downgrade to a financial institution are inherently uncertain, as they depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a firm s long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. 
  For additional information about our credit ratings and their potential effects to our liquidity, see   Liquidity Risk   Credit Ratings   in the MD A on page   79   and   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, and competitive position may be significantly adversely affected if we are unable to access the capital markets, continue to raise deposits, sell assets on favorable terms, or if there is an increase in our borrowing costs. 
  Liquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the GSEs, to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be significantly adversely affected by our ability to access the capital markets; illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets; unforeseen outflows of cash, including customer deposits, funding for commitments and contingencies, including Variable Rate Demand Notes; the ability to sell assets on favorable terms; increased liquidity requirements on our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries imposed by their home countries; or negative perceptions about our short- or long-term business prospects, including downgrades of our credit ratings. Several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control, such as a general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, changes in the regulatory environment, actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us.  
  Our cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market interest rates and to our credit spreads. Credit spreads are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of our funding. Changes in our credit spreads are market-driven, and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile. 
  For additional information about our liquidity position and other liquidity matters, including credit ratings and outlooks and the policies and procedures we use to manage our liquidity risks, see  

Capital Management   and   Liquidity Risk   in the MD A on pages   71   and   76  . 
  Bank of America Corporation is a holding company and as such we are dependent upon our subsidiaries for liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. Applicable laws and regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, may restrict our ability to transfer funds from our subsidiaries to Bank of America Corporation or other subsidiaries. 
  Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company. For instance, the parent company depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. In addition, our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses.  
  Additional restrictions on related party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds we need to make payments on our obligations or dividend payments. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors. For additional information regarding our ability to pay dividends, see   Note 15   Shareholders  Equity   and   Note 18   Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Credit Risk 
  Credit Risk is the Risk of Loss Arising from a Borrower, Obligor or Counterparty Default when a Borrower, Obligor or Counterparty does not Meet its Obligations. 
  Increased credit risk, due to economic or market disruptions, insufficient credit loss reserves or concentration of credit risk, may necessitate increased provisions for credit losses and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  When we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their agreements. A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. As one of the  

Table of Contents  

     nation s largest lenders, the credit quality of our consumer and commercial portfolios has a significant impact on our earnings. 
  Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to weigh on our credit portfolios. Economic or market disruptions are likely to increase our credit exposure to customers, obligors or other counterparties due to the increased risk that they may default on their obligations to us. These potential increases in delinquencies and default rates could adversely affect our consumer credit card, home equity, consumer real estate and purchased credit-impaired portfolios, through increased charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. In addition, despite improvement in the mix of our commercial portfolio, increased credit risk could also adversely affect our commercial loan portfolios where we continue to experience elevated losses, particularly in our commercial real estate portfolios, reflecting continued stress across industries, property types and borrowers. 
  We estimate and establish an allowance for credit losses for losses inherent in our lending activities (including unfunded lending commitments), excluding those measured at fair value, through a charge to earnings. The amount of allowance is determined based on our evaluation of the potential credit losses included within our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance, which is critical to our financial condition and results of operations, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how our borrowers will react to those conditions. Our ability to assess future economic conditions or the creditworthiness of our customers, obligors or other counterparties is imperfect. The ability of our borrowers to repay their loans will likely be impacted by changes in economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our forecasts.  
  As with any such assessments, there is also the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that we identify. We may suffer unexpected losses if the models and assumptions we use to establish reserves and make judgments in extending credit to our borrowers and other counterparties become less predictive of future events. Although we believe that our allowance for credit losses was in compliance with applicable accounting standards at December 31, 2011, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address future credit losses, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate. In such an event, we might need to increase the size of our allowance, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  In the ordinary course of our business, we also may be subject to a concentration of credit risk in a particular industry, country, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, and the processes by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries and countries may not function as we have anticipated. While our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers/dealers, commercial banks, investment funds and insurers. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry. In the ordinary course of business, we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities. Unfavorable  

economic or political conditions, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies could impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of sovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities and expose us to credit risk. 
  We also have a concentration of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate, consumer credit card and commercial real estate portfolios, which represent a large percentage of our overall credit portfolio. The economic downturn has adversely affected these portfolios and further exposed us to this concentration of risk. Continued economic weakness or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes could result in materially higher credit losses. 
  For additional information about our credit risk and credit risk management policies and procedures, see   Credit Risk Management   in the MD A on page   80   and   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  We could suffer losses as a result of the actions of or deterioration in the commercial soundness of our counterparties and other financial services institutions. 
  We could suffer losses and our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other market participants. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers/dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to significant future liquidity problems, including losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us. Any such losses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses. 
  We are party to a large number of derivatives transactions, including credit derivatives. Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. The terms of certain of our OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change in our credit ratings, we may be required to provide additional collateral or to provide other remedies, or our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements. 

Table of Contents  

     Many derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling some positions difficult. Many derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold, and may not be able to obtain, the underlying security, loan or other obligation.  
  Following the downgrade of the credit ratings of the Corporation, we have engaged in discussions with certain derivative and other counterparties regarding their rights under these agreements. In response to counterparties  inquiries and requests, we have discussed and in some cases substituted derivative contracts and other trading agreements, including naming BANA as the new counterparty. Our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements to meet counterparties  requests may be subject to certain limitations, including counterparty willingness, regulatory limitations on naming BANA as the new counterparty, and the type or amount of collateral required. It is possible that such limitations on our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements, including naming BANA as the new counterparty, could adversely affect our results of operations.  
  Derivatives contracts and other transactions entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis. While a transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of default may find it more difficult to enforce the contract. In addition, as new and more complex derivatives products have been created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts may arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. 
  For additional information on our derivatives exposure, see   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Market Risk 
  Market Risk is the Risk that Values of Assets and Liabilities or Revenues will be Adversely Affected by Changes in Market Conditions Such as Market Volatility. Market Risk is Inherent in the Financial Instruments Associated with our Operations and Activities, Including Loans, Deposits, Securities, Short-term Borrowings, Long-term Debt, Trading Account Assets and Liabilities, and Derivatives. 
  Our businesses and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, significantly adversely affected by changes in the levels of market volatility and by other financial or capital market conditions. 
  Our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected by market risk factors such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, the implied volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and other economic and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect, among other things, (i) the value of our on- and off-balance sheet securities, trading assets other financial instruments, and MSRs, (ii) the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, (iii) the value of assets under management, which could reduce our fee income relating to those assets, (iv) customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, (v) the volume of client  

activity in our trading operations, (vi) investment banking fees, and (vii) the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage. Any of these developments could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  We use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations. Our models, which rely on historical trends and assumptions, may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements and illiquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events. The models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators.  
  In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, such as the market conditions experienced in 2008 and 2009, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. In addition, challenging market conditions may also adversely affect our investment banking fees. 
  For additional information about market risk and our market risk management policies and procedures, see   Market Risk Management   in the MD A on page   112  . 
  Further downgrades in the U.S. government     s sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to the Corporation and its credit ratings and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict. 
  On August 2, 2011, Moody s affirmed the U.S. government s existing sovereign rating, but revised the rating outlook to negative. On August 5, 2011, S P downgraded the U.S. government s long-term sovereign credit rating to AA+ from AAA and stated that the outlook on the long-term rating is negative. On the same day, S P affirmed its A-1+ short-term rating on the U.S. and removed it from CreditWatch negative. On November 28, 2011, Fitch affirmed its AAA long-term rating on the U.S., but changed the outlook from stable to negative. On the same day, Fitch affirmed its F1+ short-term rating on the U.S. All three rating agencies have indicated that they will continue to assess fiscal projections and consolidation measures, as well as the medium-term economic outlook for the United States.  
  There continues to be the perceived risk of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade of the U.S. government, including the ratings of U.S. Treasury securities. It is foreseeable that the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the U.S. government could also be correspondingly  

Table of Contents  

     affected by any such downgrade. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, including the Corporation, and are widely used as collateral by financial institutions to meet their day-to-day cash flows in the short-term debt market. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments.  
  We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a significant adverse impact to the Corporation. The credit rating agencies  ratings for the Corporation or its subsidiaries could be directly or indirectly impacted by a downgrade of the U.S. government s sovereign rating because the credit ratings of large systemically important financial institutions, including the Corporation, currently incorporate a degree of uplift due to assumptions concerning government support. In addition, the Corporation presently delivers a material portion of the residential mortgage loans it originates into GSEs, agencies or instrumentalities (or instruments insured or guaranteed thereby). We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings of these organizations will affect their ability to finance residential mortgage loans. Such ratings actions, if any, could result in a significant change to the business operations of   CRES  . 
  A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which the Corporation is subject and any related adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including those described under Risk Factors   Credit Risk    We could suffer losses as a result of the actions of or deterioration in the commercial soundness of our counterparties and other financial services institutions,  Risk Factors   Market Risk    Our businesses and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, significantly adversely affected by changes in the levels of market volatility and by other financial or capital market conditions  and Risk Factors   Liquidity Risk    Our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, and competitive position may be significantly adversely affected if we are unable to access capital markets, continue to raise deposits, sell assets on favorable terms, or if there is an increase in our borrowing costs.  
  Uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the European Union (EU), the increasing risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets, the Euro and the EU could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  In 2011, the financial crisis in Europe continued, triggered by high sovereign budget deficits and rising direct and contingent sovereign debt in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, which created concerns about the ability of these EU countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations. These conditions impacted financial markets and resulted in credit ratings downgrades for, and high and volatile bond yields on, the sovereign debt of many EU countries. Certain European countries continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress, and yields on government-issued bonds in Greece, Ireland, Italy,  

Portugal and Spain have risen and remain volatile. Despite assistance packages to certain of these countries, the creation of a joint EU-IMF European Financial Stability Facility and additional expanded financial assistance to Greece, uncertainty over the outcome of the EU governments  financial support programs and worries about sovereign finances and the stability of the Euro and EU persist. Market concerns over the direct and indirect exposure of certain European banks and insurers to these EU countries resulted in a widening of credit spreads and increased costs of funding for these financial institutions. While we have reduced our exposure to European financial institutions, the insolvency of one or more major European financial institutions could adversely impact financial markets and, consequently, our results of operations. 
  Risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in Europe could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery, sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of European financial institutions and international financial institutions with exposure to the region, including us. Market and economic disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and residential mortgages, and housing prices among other factors. There can be no assurance that the market disruptions in Europe, including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions, will not spread, nor can there be any assurance that future assistance packages will be available or, even if provided, will be sufficient to stabilize the affected countries and markets in Europe or elsewhere. To the extent uncertainty regarding the European economic recovery continues to negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer credit factors, or should the EU enter a deep recession, both the U.S. economy and our business and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. Global economic uncertainty, regulatory initiatives and reform have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios. Our Regional Risk Committee, a subcommittee of our Credit Risk Committee, is seeking to address this risk but there can be no assurance our efforts in this respect will be sufficient or successful. Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, was   $15.3 billion   at December 31, 2011 compared to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2010. Our total net sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was   $10.5 billion   at December 31, 2011 compared to   $12.4 billion   at December 31, 2010, after taking into account net credit default protection. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of net credit default protection purchased was   $4.9 billion   and $4.2 billion. Losses could still result because our credit protection contracts only pay out under certain scenarios. 
  For more information on our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in Europe, see   Executive Summary   2011 Economic and Business Environment   in the MD A on page   27   and   Non-U.S. Portfolio   in the MD A on page   104  . 
  Declines in the value of certain of our assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
  We have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including, among others, certain corporate loans and loan commitments, loans held-for-sale, repurchase agreements, long-term deposits, trading account assets and liabilities, derivatives assets and liabilities, available-for-sale debt and marketable equity securities, consumer-related MSRs and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value. We determine the fair values of  

Table of Contents  

     these instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate. 
  Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct and significant impact on our results of operations, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. Changes in loan prepayment speeds, which are influenced by interest rates, among other things, can impact the value of our MSRs and can result in substantially higher or lower mortgage banking income and earnings, depending upon our ability to fully hedge the performance of our MSRs. Fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions. The financial strength of counterparties, such as monolines, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading activity for these assets, which may make it very difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. 
  Asset values also directly impact revenues in our asset management businesses. We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients  portfolios or investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of our clients  portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets. 
  For additional information about fair value measurements, see   Note 22   Fair Value Measurements     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . For additional information about our asset management businesses, see Business Segment Operations     Global Wealth   Investment Management   in the MD A on page   52  . 
  Changes to loan prepayment speeds could reduce our net interest income and earnings.  
  Government officials and regulatory authorities have advanced various proposals to assist homeowners and the housing and mortgage markets more generally. Certain of these proposals have included expanded access to residential mortgage loan refinancing options, including refinancing options for borrowers who may be current on their existing mortgage loans and for borrowers whose current mortgage principal balance may exceed the current appraised value of the mortgaged property. Expanded refinancing access may also result from our implementation of the Servicing Resolution Agreements discussed above. Adoption of proposals of this nature could result in an increased number of mortgage refinancings, and accordingly, greater reductions in interest rates and principal prepayments on the mortgage loans in our portfolio than we would otherwise expect to experience without those proposals. Reductions in interest rates and increases in mortgage prepayment speeds of this nature could adversely impact the value of our MSR asset, cause a significant acceleration of purchase premium amortization on our mortgage portfolio, adversely affect our net interest margin, and adversely affect our net interest income and earnings. 
  For additional information about interest rate risk management, see   Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities   in the MD A on page   116  . 

Regulatory and Legal Risk 
  Bank regulatory agencies may require us to hold higher levels of regulatory capital, increase our regulatory capital ratios or increase liquidity, which could result in the need to issue additional securities that qualify as regulatory capital or to sell company assets. 
  We are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve. These guidelines establish regulatory capital requirements for banking institutions to meet minimum requirements as well as to qualify as a  well-capitalized  institution. (A  well-capitalized  institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 basis points higher than the minimum guidelines.) The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by required leverage ratios, defined as Tier I (the highest grade) capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments. If any of our insured depository institutions fails to maintain its status as  well-capitalized  under the capital rules of their primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve will require us to enter into an agreement to bring the insured depository institution or institutions back into a  well-capitalized  status. For the duration of such an agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose restrictions on the activities in which we may engage. If we were to fail to enter into such an agreement, or fail to comply with the terms of such agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose more severe restrictions on the activities in which we may engage, including requiring us to cease and desist in activities permitted under the Bank Holding Act. 
  It is possible that increases in regulatory capital requirements, changes in how regulatory capital is calculated or increases to liquidity requirements, may cause the loss of our  well-capitalized  status unless we increase our capital levels by issuing additional common stock, thus diluting our existing shareholders, or by selling assets. On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve proposed rules relating to risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, single-counterparty credit limits and early remediation requirements. These rules, when finalized, are likely to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as we may need to sell certain assets, perhaps on terms unfavorable to us and contrary to our business plans. Such a requirement could also compel us to issue additional securities, which could dilute our current common stockholders. For additional information about the proposals described above and their potential effect on our required levels of regulatory capital, see   Capital Management   Regulatory Capital   in the MD A on page   72  . 
  Government measures to regulate the financial industry, including the Financial Reform Act, either individually, in combination or in the aggregate, have increased and will continue to increase our compliance costs and could require us to change certain of our business practices, impose significant additional costs on us, limit the products that we offer, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require us to increase our regulatory capital, impact the value of assets that we hold, significantly reduce our revenues or otherwise materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations 

Table of Contents  

     As a financial institution, we are heavily regulated at the state, federal and international levels. As a result of the 2008-2009 financial crisis and related global economic downturn, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased public and legislative scrutiny as well as stricter and more comprehensive regulation of our businesses. These regulatory and legislative measures, either individually, in combination or in the aggregate, could require us to further change certain of our business practices, impose significant additional costs on us, limit the products that we offer, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require us to increase our regulatory capital, impact the value of assets that we hold, significantly reduce our revenues or otherwise materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. 
  On October 11, 2011, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, FDIC and the SEC, four of the five regulatory agencies charged with promulgating regulations implementing limitations on proprietary trading as well as the sponsorship of or investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (the Volcker Rule) established by the Financial Reform Act, released for comment proposed regulations. On January 11, 2012, the CFTC, the fifth agency, released for comment its proposed regulations under the Volcker Rule. The proposed regulations include clarifications to the definition of proprietary trading and distinctions between permitted and prohibited activities. The comment period for the first regulations proposed ended on February 13, 2012 and the comment period for the CFTC regulations will end in March 2012. 
  The statutory provisions of the Volcker Rule will become effective on July 21, 2012, whether or not the final regulations are adopted, and it gives certain financial institutions two years from the effective date, with opportunities for additional extensions, to bring activities and investments into compliance. Although   GBAM   exited its stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011 in anticipation of the Volcker Rule and to further our initiative to optimize our balance sheet, the ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule on us remains uncertain. However, based on the contents of the proposed regulations, it is possible that the implementation of the Volcker Rule could limit or restrict our remaining trading activities. Implementation of the Volcker Rule could also limit or restrict our ability to sponsor and hold ownership interests in hedge funds, private equity funds and other subsidiary operations. Additionally, implementation of the Volcker Rule could increase our operational and compliance costs and reduce our trading revenues, and adversely affect our results of operations. The date by which final regulations will be issued is uncertain.  
  Additionally, the Financial Reform Act includes measures to broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives, imposing new capital, margin, reporting, registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants and imposing position limits on certain OTC derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the CFTC and the SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings by these agencies. The Financial Reform Act required regulators to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to implement these regulations by July 16, 2011. However, the rulemaking process was not completed as of that date, and is not expected to conclude until well into 2012. Further, the regulators granted temporary relief from certain requirements that would have taken effect on July 16, 2011 absent any rulemaking. The SEC temporary relief is effective until final rules relevant to each requirement become effective. The CFTC  

temporary relief is effective until the earlier of July 16, 2012 or the date on which final rules relevant to each requirement become effective. The ultimate impact of these derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply, continue to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose additional operational and compliance costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. 
  In April 2011, a new regulation became effective that implements revisions to the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act that increased our FDIC expense. In addition, the FDIC has broad discretionary authority to increase assessments on large and highly complex institutions on a case by case basis. Any future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other bank industry fees could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  The Financial Reform Act provided for a new resolution authority to establish a process to resolve the failure of large systemically important financial institutions. As part of that process, we are required to develop and implement a resolution plan which will be subject to review by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve to determine whether our plan is credible. As a result of FDIC and Federal Reserve review, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years which could impose operational costs and could potentially result in the divestiture or restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries. 
  In 2011, the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly approved a final rule that requires the Corporation and other bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, as well as companies designated as systemic by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to periodically report to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve their plans for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve determine that a company s plan is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, then the FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose on the company, or on any of its subsidiaries, more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations. The Corporation s initial plan is required to be submitted on or before July 1, 2012, and to be updated annually. Similarly, in the U.K., the FSA has issued proposed rules requiring the submission of significant information about certain U.K. incorporated subsidiaries (including information on intra-group dependencies and legal entity separation) to allow the FSA to develop resolution plans. As a result of the FSA review, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years which could impose operational costs and potentially could result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries. 
  Under the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically important financial institution such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may, in certain circumstances, be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such systemically important financial institution. In such a case, the FDIC could invoke a new form of resolution authority, called the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, the orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Macroprudential systemic protection is the primary objective of the orderly liquidation authority, subject to minimum threshold protections for creditors. Accordingly, in  

Table of Contents  

     certain circumstances under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC could permit payment of obligations determined to be systemically significant (for example, short-term creditors or operating creditors) in lieu of the payment of other obligations (for example, long-term creditors) without the need to obtain creditors  consent or prior court review. Additionally, under the orderly liquidation authority, amounts owed to the U.S. government generally enjoy a statutory payment priority. 
  The Financial Reform Act established the CFPB to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under the federal consumer financial laws. In addition, under the Financial Reform Act, the CFPB was granted general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under Federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, on July 21, 2011, certain federal consumer financial protection statutes and related regulatory authority were transferred to the CFPB. As a consequence of this transfer of authority, certain Federal consumer financial laws to which we are subject, including, but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Electronic Fund Transfers Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Truth in Lending and Truth in Savings Acts will be enforced by the CFPB, subject to certain statutory limitations. On January 4, 2012, a Director of the CFPB was appointed, via recess appointment, and accordingly, the CFPB was vested with full authority to exercise all supervisory, enforcement and rulemaking authorities granted to the CFPB under the Financial Reform Act, including its supervisory powers over non-bank financial institutions such as pay-day lenders and other types of non-bank financial institutions. 
  On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements and the early remediation requirements established under the Financial Reform Act. The enhanced standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, single-counterparty credit limits, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for certain companies determined to pose a threat to financial stability. Comments on the proposed rules are due by March 31, 2012, and final regulations will not be adopted until after that date. The final rules are likely to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us. 
  Many of the provisions under the Financial Reform Act have begun to be phased in or will be phased in over the next several months or years and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. The Financial Reform Act will continue to have a significant and negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and new restrictions. The Financial Reform Act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. The ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act on our businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain provisions.  
  In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued  Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems  and  International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring  (together, Basel III). If  

implemented by U.S. banking regulators as proposed, Basel III s capital standards could significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing that the disqualification be phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets, MSRs, investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others, within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of accumulated OCI in capital, increased capital requirements for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements.  
  Basel III also proposes two minimum liquidity measures. The LCR measures the amount of a financial institution s unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The NSFR measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. 
  On July 19, 2011, the Basel Committee published the consultative document,  Globally systemic important banks: Assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement,  which sets out measures for global, systemically important financial institutions including the methodology for measuring systemic importance, the additional capital required (the SIFI buffer), and the arrangements by which they will be phased in. As proposed, the SIFI buffer would be met with additional Tier 1 common equity ranging from   one percent   to   2.5 percent  , and in certain circumstances,   3.5 percent  . This will be phased in from 2016 through 2018. U.S. banking regulators have not yet provided similar rules for U.S. implementation of a SIFI buffer. 
  Preparation for Basel III has influenced and, when finalized, is likely to continue to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as we may need to liquidate certain assets, perhaps on terms unfavorable to us and contrary to our business plans. Such a requirement could also compel us to issue additional securities, which could dilute our current common stockholders. 
  For additional information about the regulatory initiatives discussed above, see   Regulatory Matters   in the MD A on page   66  .  
  Changes in the structure of the GSEs and the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private markets, or the conversion of the current conservatorship of the GSEs into receivership, could result in significant changes to the business operations of   CRES  , and adversely impact certain operations of   GBAM  . 
  During the last ten years, the Corporation and its subsidiaries and legacy companies have sold over $2.0 trillion of loans to the GSEs. Each GSE is currently in a conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, acting as conservator. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorships will end, or any associated changes to the GSEs  business structure that could result. We also cannot predict whether the conservatorships will end in receivership. There are several proposed approaches to reform the GSEs which, if enacted, could change the structure of the GSEs and the relationship among  

Table of Contents  

     the GSEs, the government and the private markets, including the trading markets for agency conforming mortgage loans and markets for mortgage-related securities in which   GBAM   participates. We cannot predict the prospects for the enactment, timing or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs. Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to exist in their current form. GSE reform, if enacted, could result in a significant change to the business operations of   CRES   and adversely impact certain operations of   GBAM  . 
  We face substantial potential legal liability and significant regulatory action, which could have material adverse effects on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, or cause significant reputational harm to us. 
  We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against us and other financial institutions remain high and are increasing. Increased litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could adversely impact our business prospects. In addition, we continue to face increased litigation risk and regulatory scrutiny. We have continued to experience increased litigation and other disputes with counterparties regarding relative rights and responsibilities. Consumers, clients and other counterparties have grown more litigious. Our experience with certain regulatory authorities suggests a migration towards an increasing supervisory focus on enforcement, including in connection with alleged violations of law and customer harm. The current environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance burdens, and enhanced regulatory enforcement, combined with ongoing uncertainty related to the continuing evolution of the regulatory environment, has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may limit our ability to continue providing certain products and services. 
  These litigation and regulatory matters and any related settlements could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. They could also negatively impact our reputation and lead to volatility of our stock price. For a further discussion of litigation risks, see   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our businesses and earnings are affected by domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending, investing and capital raising activities and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. The actions of the Federal Reserve also can materially affect the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities and MSRs, and its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Our businesses and earnings are also affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by the U.S. government, various U.S. regulatory authorities, and non-U.S. governments and regulatory authorities. Changes in domestic and international fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult  

to predict but could have an adverse impact on our capital requirements and the costs of running our businesses, in turn adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  The U.S. Congress and the Administration have signaled growing interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income tax. While the timing of such reform is unclear, possible approaches include lowering the 35 percent corporate tax rate, modifying the taxation of income earned outside of the U.S. and limiting or eliminating various other deductions, tax credits and/or other tax preferences. It is not possible at this time to quantify either the one-time impact from remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities that might result upon enactment of tax reform or the ongoing impact reform might have on income tax expense, but either of these impacts could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  In addition, the income from certain non--U.S. subsidiaries has not been subject to U.S. income tax as a result of long-standing deferral provisions applicable to income that is derived in the active conduct of a banking and financing business (active finance income). The U.S. Congress has extended the application of these deferral provisions several times, most recently in 2010. These provisions now are set to expire for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. Absent an extension of these provisions, active financing income earned by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally be subject to a tax provision that considers incremental U.S. income tax. The impact of the expiration of these provisions would depend upon the amount, composition and geographic mix of our future earnings. 
  Other countries have also proposed and, in some cases, adopted certain regulatory changes targeted at financial institutions or that otherwise affect us. The EU has adopted increased capital requirements and the U.K. has (i) increased liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K; (ii) adopted a Bank Tax Levy which will apply to the aggregate balance sheet of branches and subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks and banking groups operating in the U.K.; and (iii) proposed the creation and production of recovery and resolution plans by U.K.-regulated entities. 
  On July 19, 2011, the U.K. 2011 Finance Bill was enacted which reduced the corporate income tax rate one percent to 26 percent beginning on April 1, 2011, and then to 25 percent effective April 1, 2012. These rate reductions will favorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings but also required us to remeasure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rates. The income tax benefit for 2011 included a $782 million charge for the remeasurement, substantially all of which was recorded in   GBAM  . If corporate income tax rates were to be reduced to 23 percent by 2014 as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset balance, a charge to income tax expense of approximately $400 million for each one percent reduction in the rate would result in each period of enactment (for a total of approximately $800 million). We are also monitoring other international legislative proposals that could materially impact us, such as changes to corporate income tax laws. Currently, in the U.K., net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) have an indefinite life. Were the U.K.  

Table of Contents  

     taxing authorities to introduce limitations on the future utilization of NOLs and were the Corporation unable to document its continued ability to fully utilize its NOLs, we would be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to corporate income tax expense. Depending upon the nature of the limitations, such a charge could be material to our results of operations in the period of enactment.  
  Risk of the Competitive Environment in which We Operate 
  We face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry. 
  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Over time, there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry, and this trend accelerated in recent years. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and financial services markets. We will continue to experience intensified competition as consolidation in and globalization of the financial services industry may result in larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. In addition, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions to compete with technology companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions. Increased competition may negatively affect our results of operations by creating pressure to lower prices on our products and services and reducing market share. 
  Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects. 
  Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. Public perception of us and others in the financial services industry appeared to decline in 2011. We continue to face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn as well as alleged irregularities in servicing, foreclosure, consumer collections, mortgage loan modifications and other practices, lending volumes, compensation practices, our acquisitions of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch and the suitability or reasonableness of recommending particular trading or investment strategies. 
  Significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unintended disclosure of confidential information, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can significantly adversely affect our reputation.  
  We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protections and other matters. Principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial  

privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions, and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid into the future. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner that is inconsistent with our current or future practices, or that is inconsistent with one another. We face regulatory, reputational and operational risks if personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession is mishandled or misused.  
  We could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our businesses. 
  Our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues gives rise to reputational risk that could cause significant harm to us and our business prospects, including failure to properly address operational risks. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. 
  Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our businesses and failure to do so could adversely affect our business prospects, including our competitive position and results of operations. 
  Our performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Competition for qualified personnel within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry has been, and is expected to continue to be, intense. Our competitors include non-U.S.-based institutions and institutions otherwise not subject to compensation and hiring regulations imposed on U.S. institutions and financial institutions in particular. The difficulty we face in competing for key personnel is exacerbated in emerging markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that may have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region. 
  In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, we must provide market-level compensation. As a large financial and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices (which may or may not affect our competitors) by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC or other regulators around the world. Any future limitations on executive compensation imposed by legislation or regulation could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified employees. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our annual bonus compensation paid to our senior employees has in recent years taken the form of long-term equity awards. The value of long-term equity awards to senior employees generally has been negatively affected by the significant decline in the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified individuals, our business prospects, including our competitive position and results of operations, could be adversely affected.

     In addition, if we fail to retain the wealth advisors that we employ in   GWIM  , particularly those with significant client relationships, such failure could result in a significant loss of clients or the withdrawal of significant client assets. Any such loss or withdrawal could adversely impact   GWIM     s   business activities and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We may not be able to achieve expected cost savings from cost-saving initiatives, including from Project New BAC, or in accordance with currently anticipated time frames. 
  We are currently engaged in numerous efforts to achieve certain cost savings, including, among other things, Project New BAC.  
  Project New BAC is a two-phase, enterprise-wide initiative to simplify and streamline workflows and processes, align businesses and costs more closely with our overall strategic plan and operating principles, and increase revenues. Phase 1 focuses on the consumer businesses, including   Deposits  ,   Card Services   and   CRES  , and related support, technology and operations functions. Phase 2 focuses on   Global Commercial Banking  ,   GBAM   and   GWIM  , and related support, technology and operations functions not subject to evaluation in Phase 1. All aspects of Project New BAC are expected to be implemented by the end of 2014. 
  We may be unable to fully realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our cost saving initiatives or in accordance with currently anticipated timeframes. 
  Our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our businesses. 
  Our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad range of financial products and services, delivered through multiple distribution channels. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. We might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, responding or adapting to changes in consumer spending and saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers. 
  Risks Related to Risk Management 
  Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses. 
  Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to the types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks, among others. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and increases in the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have resulted in a heightened level of risk for us. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these  

risks, including all correlations and downstream secondary or follow-on effects that occur. 
  For additional information about our risk management policies and procedures, see   Managing Risk   in the MD A on page   68  . 
  A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. Any such failure also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor, on a continuous basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization, including losses resulting from unauthorized trades by any employees. 
  Integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our internal processes, systems, relationships with third parties and the vast array of employees and key executives in our day-to-day and ongoing operations. With regard to the physical infrastructure and systems that support our operations, we have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant and widespread disruption to our infrastructure or systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and cyber attacks. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. 
  Information security risks for large financial institutions such as the Corporation have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, networks and our customers  devices have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers  confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers  or other third parties   

Table of Contents  

     business operations. Because of our prominence, we believe that such attacks may continue. 
  Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of the Corporation and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our Internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our expanded geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, the continued uncertain global economic environment, and system and customer account conversions. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. 
  In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and increased interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses. This consolidation and interconnectivity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses, and could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  
  Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  For more information on operational risks and our operational risk management, see   Operational Risk Management   in the MD A on page   119  . 

Risk of Being an International Business 
  We are subject to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We do business throughout the world, including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets. Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social or judicial instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, other restrictive actions, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, and changes in legislation. These risks are especially acute in emerging markets. Many non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we do business have been negatively impacted by recessionary conditions. While a number of these jurisdictions are showing signs of recovery, others continue to experience increasing levels of stress. In addition, the increasing potential risk of default on sovereign debt in some non-U.S. jurisdictions could expose us to substantial losses. Risks in one country can affect our operations in another country or countries, including our operations in the U.S. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have a significant and adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. 
  We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. Furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified, because non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are generally smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets. 
  We are subject to geopolitical risks, including acts or threats of terrorism, and actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response thereto and/or military conflicts, that could adversely affect business and economic conditions abroad as well as in the U.S. 
  For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolio, see   Non-U.S. Portfolio   in the MD A on page   104  .

     Risk from Accounting Changes 
  Changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior period financial statements. 

Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm) may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the Corporation needing to revise and republish prior period financial statements.  
  For more information on some of our critical accounting policies and standards and recent accounting changes, see   Complex Accounting Estimates   in the MD A on page   120   and   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  .

   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    This report on Form 10-K, the documents that it incorporates by reference and the documents into which it may be incorporated by reference may contain, and from time to time Bank of America Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Corporation) and its management may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as  expects,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   targets,   intends,   plans,   goal  and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as  will,   may,   might,   should,   would  and  could.

The foregoing is not an exclusive list of all forward-looking statements the Corporation makes. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond Bank of America s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. 
  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed elsewhere in this report, under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report and in any of the Corporation s subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation s timing and determinations regarding any revised comprehensive capital plan submission and the Federal Reserve s response; the accuracy and variability of estimates and assumptions in determining the expected value of the loss-sharing reinsurance arrangement relating to the agreement with Assured Guaranty and the total cost of the agreement to the Corporation; the Corporation s resolution of certain representations and warranties obligations with the GSEs and our ability to resolve the GSEs  remaining claims; the Corporation s ability to resolve its

    2011 Economic and Business Environment 
  The banking environment and markets in which we conduct our businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by developments in the U.S. and global economies, including the results of the European Union (EU) sovereign debt crisis, continued large budget imbalances in key developed nations, and the implementation and rulemaking associated with recent financial reform. The global economy expanded at a diminished pace in 2011, with the U.S., U.K., Europe and Japan all losing momentum, while economic growth in emerging nations diminished somewhat but remained robust.

  The U.S. economy expanded only modestly in 2011, as a promising beginning with an improving labor market gave way to an appreciable slowdown in domestic demand early in the year. By mid-year, the labor market had slowed once more, followed by a  

sharp reversal in the stock market and in consumer sentiment. Increasing oil prices and supply chain disruptions stemming from Japan s earthquake, along with continued financial market anxiety due to the European sovereign debt crisis and difficult and protracted U.S. budget negotiations related to the federal debt ceiling, contributed to the weakness. As some of these factors dissipated, domestic demand picked up in the second half of 2011, easing U.S. recession fears. In the fourth quarter, equities rebounded from their mid-year declines, consumer confidence edged up and labor markets showed clear signs of improvement. The unemployment rate ended the year at 8.5 percent compared to 9.4 percent at December 31, 2010. 
  Despite subdued U.S. economic growth, year-over-year inflation drifted higher over the first three quarters of 2011, lifted in part by the surge in energy costs, before edging lower in the fourth quarter. Fears of deflation, prevalent in 2010, faded as year-over-year core inflation, which began 2011 below one percent, moved

     to above two percent by year end. Nevertheless, bond yields, which drifted gradually lower in the first half of 2011, fell during a volatile third quarter amid anxiety over the European sovereign debt crisis, exacerbated by the U.S. debt ceiling debate and fears of recession. Despite the Standard   Poor s Rating Services (S P) ratings downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, mounting concerns about Europe s financial crisis generated strong demand for U.S. government securities. The Federal Reserve completed its second round of quantitative easing near mid-year. Responding to sharp declines in equity markets, low consumer expectations and heightened worries about recession, the Federal Reserve adopted another financial support program in September 2011 aimed at lowering bond yields. The program involved sales of $400 billion of shorter-term (less than three years) government securities and purchases of an equal volume of longer-term (six years and over) government bonds. Bonds yields held near all-time post-Great Depression lows at year end. 
  Housing activity remained at historically low levels in 2011 and the supply of unsold homes remained high. Meanwhile, corporate profits continued to grow at a robust pace in 2011, despite slowing from their initial sharp rebound. After bottoming in late 2010, commercial and industrial lending also accelerated in 2011. 
  Europe 
  Europe s financial crisis escalated in 2011 despite a series of initiatives by policymakers, and several European nations were experiencing recessionary conditions in the fourth quarter. Europe s problems involve unsustainably high public debt in some nations, including Greece and Portugal, slow growth and significant refinancing risk related to maturing sovereign debt in Italy, and excess household debt and sharp declines in wealth stemming from falling home values following unsustainable housing bubbles in other nations, including Spain and Ireland. These national challenges are closely intertwined with the problems facing Europe s banks, which are some of the largest holders of the bonds of troubled European nations. During 2011, financial markets became increasingly skeptical that government policies would resolve these problems, and risk-averse investors reduced their exposures to bonds of troubled nations, driving up their bond yields and, to varying degrees, restricting access to capital markets. This exacerbated already onerous debt service burdens. In response, European policymakers provided financial support to troubled nations through the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and purchases of sovereign debt by the European Central Bank (ECB). Despite these efforts, sharp increases in the bond yields of Spanish and Italian bonds further complicated Europe s financial problems beyond the current capabilities of the EFSF. As the magnitude of the financial stresses rose, reflected in higher sovereign bond yields and mounting funding shortfalls at select banks, the ECB instituted new programs to provide low-cost, three-year loans to European banks, and expanded collateral eligibility. This served to alleviate bank funding pressures toward year end and provided greater liquidity in sovereign debt markets. 
  Asia 
  Japan s economic environment in 2011 was marked by the trauma of its massive earthquake in early 2011 that caused a dramatic decline in economic activity followed by a quick rebound. A sharp decline in consumption and domestic demand was accompanied  

by temporary production shutdowns of various intermediate and durable goods that disrupted supply chains throughout Asia and the world. The ripple effects were pronounced, although temporary, throughout Asia. China continued to grow rapidly throughout 2011, with real GDP growth exceeding nine percent, despite elevated inflation and government efforts to constrain price pressures through the tightening of monetary policy and bank credit, and regulations that limit speculation and price increases in real estate. China s economic growth slowed modestly in the second half of the year, reflecting in part slower growth of exports to Europe and other destinations. China s inflation also began to subside toward year end. Other Asian nations continued to experience strong growth rates.

  Mortgage Related Matters 
  Department of Justice/Attorney General Matters 
  On   February 9, 2012  , we reached agreements in principle (collectively, the Servicing Resolution Agreements) with (1) the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), various federal regulatory agencies and   49   state attorneys general to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination, servicing and foreclosure practices (the Global AIP), (2) the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily by Countrywide prior to and for a period following our acquisition of that lender (the FHA AIP) and (3) each of the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regarding civil monetary penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011 (the Consent Order AIPs).  
  The Servicing Resolution Agreements are subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and completion and execution of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. The FHA AIP provides for an upfront cash payment and an additional cash payment if we fail to meet certain principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period. Under the terms of the Servicing Resolution Agreements, the federal and participating state governments would provide us with releases from liability for certain alleged residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure deficiencies. 
  The financial impact of the Servicing Resolution Agreements is not expected to require any additional reserves over existing accruals as of December 31, 2011, based on our understanding of the terms of the Servicing Resolution Agreements. The refinancing assistance commitment under the Servicing Resolution Agreements is expected to be recognized as lower interest income in future periods as qualified borrowers pay reduced interest rates on loans refinanced. The Servicing Resolution Agreements do not cover claims arising out of securitization, including representations made to investors respecting mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and certain other claims. For additional information, see   Item 1A. Risk Factors   and   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Other Mortgage-related Matters   on page   63  .

     Private-label Securitization Settlement with the Bank of New York Mellon 
  On   June 28, 2011  , the Corporation, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (BAC HLS, which was subsequently merged with and into Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) in July 2011), and its legacy Countrywide affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with BNY Mellon, as trustee (Trustee), to resolve all outstanding and potential claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches (including repurchase claims), substantially all historical loan servicing claims and certain other historical claims with respect to   525   legacy Countrywide first-lien and   five   second-lien non government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts (the Covered Trusts) containing loans principally originated between   2004   and   2008   for which BNY Mellon acts as trustee or indenture trustee (the BNY Mellon Settlement). The BNY Mellon Settlement agreement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions.  
  An investor opposed to the settlement removed the proceeding to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 19, 2011, the district court denied BNY Mellon s motion to remand the proceeding to state court. BNY Mellon and the Investor Group petitioned to appeal the denial of this motion and on December 27, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted the appeal and stated in an amended scheduling order that, pursuant to statute, it would decide the appeal by February 27, 2012. On November 4, 2011, the district court entered a written order setting a discovery schedule, and discovery is ongoing. 
  It is not currently possible to predict how many of the parties who have appeared in the court proceeding will ultimately object to the BNY Mellon Settlement, whether the objections will prevent receipt of final court approval or the ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. In particular, the conduct of discovery and the resolution of the objections to the settlement and any appeals could also take a substantial period of time and these factors, along with the removal of the proceedings to federal court and the associated appeal, could materially delay the timing of final court approval. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict when the court approval process will be completed.

  Capital Related Matters 
  We continued to sell certain business units and assets as part of our capital management and enterprise-wide initiatives. In November 2011, we sold an aggregate of approximately 10.4 billion common shares of China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) through private transactions with investors resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain of $2.9 billion. We currently hold approximately one percent of the outstanding common shares of CCB. The sale also generated approximately $2.9 billion of Tier 1 common capital and reduced our risk-weighted assets by $4.9  

billion under Basel I, strengthening our Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately 24 basis points (bps).  
  In December 2011, we sold our Canadian consumer card portfolio strengthening our Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately seven bps.  
  In November and December 2011, we entered into separate agreements with certain institutional preferred and trust preferred security holders to exchange shares, or depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares, of various series of our outstanding preferred stock, or trust preferred or hybrid income term securities of various unconsolidated trusts, as applicable, with an aggregate liquidation preference of $5.8 billion for   400 million   shares of our common stock and   $2.3 billion   aggregate principal amount of our senior notes. In connection with the exchanges of trust preferred securities, we recorded gains of $1.2 billion. The exchanges in aggregate resulted in an increase of   $3.9 billion   in Tier 1 common capital and increased our Tier 1 common capital ratio approximately   29   bps under Basel I. For additional information regarding these exchanges, see   Note 13   Long-term Debt   and   Note 15   Shareholders  Equity     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Overall during 2011, we generated 126 bps of Tier 1 common capital and reduced risk-weighted assets by   $172 billion  , including as a result of, among other things, the exchanges of preferred stock and trust preferred or hybrid securities, our sales of CCB shares and the $5.0 billion investment in preferred stock and common stock warrant by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire). For additional information on the Berkshire investment, see   Note 15   Shareholders  Equity     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  As credit spreads for many financial institutions, including the Corporation, have widened during the past year due to global uncertainty and volatility, the market value of debt previously issued by financial institutions has decreased. This uncertainty in the market, evidenced by, among other things, volatility in credit spreads, makes it economically advantageous to consider purchasing and retiring certain of our outstanding debt instruments. In 2012, we completed a tender offer to purchase and retire certain subordinated notes for approximately $3.4 billion in cash and will consider additional purchases in the future depending upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. If the purchase of any debt instruments is at an amount less than the carrying value, such purchases would be accretive to earnings and capital. 
  We intend to continue to build capital through retaining earnings, actively reducing legacy asset portfolios and implementing other capital related initiatives, including focusing on reducing both higher risk-weighted assets and assets currently deducted, or expected to be deducted under Basel III, from capital. We expect non-core asset sales to play a less prominent role in our capital strategy in future periods. We issued approximately   122 million   of immediately tradable shares of common stock, or approximately $1.0 billion (after-tax) to certain employees in February 2012 in lieu of a portion of their 2011 year-end cash incentive. We may engage, from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions involving the issuance of common stock, cash or other consideration in exchange for preferred stock and certain trust preferred securities in amounts that are not expected to be material to us, either individually or in the aggregate.

     Credit Ratings 
  On December 15, 2011, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the Corporation s and BANA s long-term and short-term debt ratings as a result of Fitch s decision to lower its  support floor  for systemically important U.S. financial institutions. On November 29, 2011, S P downgraded our long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANA s long-term debt rating as a result of S P s implementation of revised methodologies for determining Banking Industry Country Risk Assessments and bank ratings. On September 21, 2011, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s) downgraded our long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANA s long-term debt rating as a result of Moody s lowering the amount of uplift for potential U.S. government support it incorporates into ratings. On February 15, 2012, Moody s placed the Corporation s long-term debt ratings and BANA s long-term and short-term debt ratings on review for possible downgrade as part of its review of financial institutions with global capital markets operations. Any adjustment to our ratings will be determined based on Moody s review; however, the agency offered guidance that downgrades to our ratings, if any, would likely be limited to one notch. 
  Currently, our long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies are as follows: Baa1/P-2 (negative) by Moody s, A-/A-2 (negative) by S P and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. The rating agencies could make further adjustments to our ratings at any time and there can be no assurance that additional downgrades will not occur.  
  Under the terms of certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings or certain subsidiaries  credit ratings, counterparties to those agreements may require us or certain subsidiaries to provide additional collateral or to terminate those contracts or agreements or provide other remedies.  
  For information regarding the risks associated with adverse changes in our credit ratings, see   Liquidity Risk   Credit Ratings   on page   79  ,   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   and   Item 1A. Risk Factors  . 
  European Union Sovereign Credit Risks 
  Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress. Uncertainty in the progress of debt restructuring negotiations and the lack of a clear resolution to the crisis has led to continued volatility in European as well as global financial markets, and if the situation worsens, may further adversely affect these markets. In December 2011, the European Central Bank announced initiatives to address European bank liquidity and funding concerns by providing low-cost, three-year loans to banks, and expanding collateral eligibility. While reducing systemic risk, there remains considerable uncertainty as to future developments regarding the European debt crisis. In early 2012, S P, Fitch and  

Moody s downgraded the credit ratings of several European countries, and S P downgraded the credit rating of the EFSF, adding to concerns about investor appetite for continued support in stabilizing the affected countries. Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, was   $15.3 billion   at December 31, 2011 compared to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2010. Our total net sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was   $10.5 billion   at December 31, 2011 compared to   $12.4 billion   at December 31, 2010, after taking into account net credit default protection. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of net credit default protection purchased was   $4.9 billion   and $4.2 billion. Losses could still result because our credit protection contracts only pay out under certain scenarios. For a further discussion of our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in Europe, see   Non-U.S. Portfolio   on page   104   and for more information about the risks associated with our non-sovereign exposures in Europe, see   Item 1A. Risk Factors  . 
  Project New BAC 
  Project New BAC is a two-phase, enterprise-wide initiative to simplify and streamline workflows and processes, align businesses and expenses more closely with our overall strategic plan and operating principles, and increase revenues. Phase 1 evaluations, which were completed in September 2011, focused on the consumer businesses, including   Deposits  ,   Card Services   and   CRES  , and related support, technology and operations functions. Phase 2 evaluations began in October 2011 and are focused on   Global Commercial Banking  ,   GBAM   and   GWIM  , and related support, technology and operations functions not subject to evaluation in Phase 1. Phase 2 evaluations are expected to continue through April 2012. 
  Implementation of Phase 1 recommendations began in 2011. Phase 1 has a stated goal of a reduction of approximately 30,000 positions, with natural attrition and the elimination of unfilled positions expected to represent a significant part of the reduction. A stated goal of the full implementation of Phase 1 is to reduce certain costs by $5 billion per year by 2014 and we anticipate that more than 20 percent of these cost savings could be achieved by the end of 2012. As implementation of the Phase 1 recommendations continues and Phase 2 begins, reductions in staffing levels in the affected areas are expected to result in some incremental costs including severance. 
  Reductions in the areas subject to evaluation for Phase 2 have not yet been fully identified, and accordingly, potential cost savings cannot be estimated at this time; however, they are expected to be lower than Phase 1 because the businesses have lower headcount. All aspects of New BAC are expected to be implemented by the end of 2014. There were no material expenses related to New BAC recorded in 2011. For information about the risks associated with Project New BAC, see   Item 1A. Risk Factors  .

     Performance Overview 
  Net income was   $1.4 billion   in   2011   compared to a net loss of   $2.2 billion   in   2010  . After preferred stock dividends of   $1.4 billion   in both   2011   and   2010  , net income applicable to common shareholders was   $85 million  , or   $0.01   per diluted common share in   2011   compared to a net loss of   $3.6 billion  , or   $0.37   per diluted common share in   2010  . The principal contributors to the pre-tax net income in   2011   were the following: gains of   $6.5 billion   on the sale of CCB shares (we currently hold approximately one percent of the outstanding common shares), a   $7.4 billion   reduction in the allowance for credit losses,   $3.4 billion   of gains on sales of debt securities, positive fair value adjustments of   $3.3 billion   related to our own credit spreads on structured liabilities, a   $1.2 billion   gain on the exchange of certain trust preferred securities for common stock and debt and DVA gains on derivatives of   $1.0 billion  , net of hedges. These contributors were offset by   $15.6 billion   in representations and warranties provision, litigation expense of $5.6 billion, goodwill impairment charges of   $3.2 billion  , $1.8 billion of mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, and   $1.1 billion   of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture.

    Fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. Other companies may define or calculate this measure differently. For more information on this measure, see   Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38  , and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Table XV. 

Net interest income on a FTE basis   decreased     $7.1 billion   in   2011   to   $45.6 billion  . The   decline   was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment security yields. Lower trading-related net interest income also negatively impacted   2011   results. These decreases were partially offset by ongoing reductions in our debt footprint and lower rates paid on deposits. The net interest yield on a FTE basis was   2.48   percent for   2011   compared to   2.78   percent for   2010  . 
  Noninterest income   decreased     $9.9 billion   in   2011   to   $48.8 billion  . The most significant contributors to the decline were lower mortgage banking income, down   $11.6 billion   largely due to higher representations and warranties provision, and a decrease of   $3.4 billion   in trading account profits. These declines were partially offset by the gains on the sale of CCB shares and higher positive fair value adjustments related to our own credit on structured liabilities in   2011  . In addition, in connection with separate agreements with certain trust preferred security holders to exchange their holdings for common stock and senior notes, we recorded gains of   $1.2 billion   in   2011  . For additional information on these exchange agreements, see   Note 13   Long-term Debt     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  The provision for credit losses   decreased     $15.0 billion   in   2011   to   $13.4 billion  . The provision for credit losses was $7.4 billion lower than net charge-offs for   2011  , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, as portfolio trends continued to improve across most of the consumer and commercial businesses, particularly the   Card Services   and commercial real estate portfolios partially offset by additions to consumer purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a   $5.9 billion   reduction in the allowance for credit losses in   2010  .  
  Noninterest expense   decreased     $2.8 billion   in   2011   to   $80.3 billion  . The decline was driven by a   $9.2 billion   decrease in goodwill impairment charges and a   $1.2 billion   decline in merger and restructuring charges in   2011  . Partially offsetting these decreases was a   $4.9 billion   increase in other general operating expense which included increases of   $3.0 billion   in litigation expense and   $1.6 billion   in mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, and an   increase   of   $1.8 billion   in personnel costs due to the continued build-out of certain businesses, technology costs as well as increases in default-related servicing costs. 
  The income tax benefit on a FTE basis was   $704 million   on the pre-tax income of   $742 million   for   2011   compared to income tax expense on a FTE basis of   $2.1 billion   on the pre-tax loss of   $153 million   for   2010  . For more information, see   Financial Highlights   Income Tax Expense   on page   34  .

   Segment Results 
  The following discussion provides an overview of the results of our business segments and   All Other   for   2011   compared to   2010  . For additional information on these results, see   Business Segment Operations   on page   39  . 

(1)   
    Total revenue is net of interest expense and is on a FTE basis which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on this measure, see   Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38  , and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Table XV. 
       
    Deposits   net income   decreased   compared to the prior year due to a decline in revenue partially offset by lower noninterest expense. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by a decline in service charges reflecting the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E that were fully implemented during the third quarter of 2010, partially offset by an increase in net interest income as a result of a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline. Noninterest expense   decreased   due to lower litigation and operating expenses partially offset by an increase in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expense. 
  Card Services   net income   increased   compared to the prior year due primarily to a   $10.4 billion   non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge in   2010   and a   decrease   in the provision for credit losses. The decrease in revenue was driven by lower average loan balances and yields. Noninterest income   decreased   primarily due to the implementation of the Durbin Amendment, the absence of the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position in 2010 and the implementation of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act). 
  CRES     net loss     increased   compared to the prior year primarily due to a   decline   in revenue and an   increase   in noninterest expense. Revenue   declined   due to an   increase   in representations and warranties provision,   lower   core production income and a   decrease   in insurance income due to the sale of Balboa Insurance Company s lender-placed insurance business (Balboa). Noninterest expense   increased   due to higher litigation expense, increased mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, higher default-related and other loss mitigation expenses and a higher non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower insurance and production expenses. 
  Global Commercial Banking   net income   increased   compared to the prior year primarily due to an improvement in the provision for credit losses. Revenue   decreased   primarily driven by   lower   net interest income related to asset and liability management (ALM) activities and   lower   average loan balances, partially offset by an increase in average deposits. The   decrease   in the provision for credit losses was driven by improved economic conditions and an accelerated rate of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio. 

GBAM   net income   decreased   compared to the prior year driven by a   decline   in sales and trading revenue due to a challenging market environment, partially offset by DVA gains, net of hedges. Provision for credit losses   decreased   driven by the positive impact of the economic environment on the credit portfolio in 2011. Higher noninterest expense was driven primarily by increased costs related to investments in infrastructure. Income tax expense included a charge related to the U.K. corporate income tax rate changes enacted during the year to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets. 
  GWIM   net income   increased   compared to the prior year driven by higher net interest income, higher asset management fees and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Revenue   increased   driven by higher asset management fees from higher market levels and long-term assets under management (AUM) flows as well as higher net interest income. The provision for credit losses   decreased   driven by improving portfolio trends. Noninterest expense   increased   due to higher volume-driven expenses and personnel costs associated with the continued investment in the business.  
  All Other   net income   increased   compared to the prior year primarily due to higher noninterest income and lower merger and restructuring charges. Noninterest income increased due to an increase in the positive fair value adjustments related to our own credit spreads on structured liabilities as well as the gain on the sale of CCB shares in 2011. The provision for credit losses   decreased   primarily due to divestitures, improvements in delinquencies, collections and insolvencies in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio and continued run-off in the legacy Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) commercial portfolio. 
    Financial Highlights 
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income on a FTE basis   decreased     $7.1 billion   to   $45.6 billion   for   2011   compared to   2010  . The   decline   was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment security yields, including the acceleration of purchase premium amortization from an increase in modeled prepayment expectations, and increased hedge ineffectiveness. Lower trading-related net interest income also negatively impacted   2011   results.  

Table of Contents  

     These decreases were partially offset by ongoing reductions in our debt footprint and lower interest rates paid on deposits. The net interest yield on a FTE basis   decreased     30   bps to   2.48 percent   for   2011   compared to   2010   as the yield continues to be under pressure due to the aforementioned items and the low rate environment. We expect net interest income to continue to be muted based on the current forward yield curve in 2012. 
  Noninterest Income   

Noninterest income   decreased     $9.9 billion   to   $48.8 billion   for   2011   compared to   2010  . The following highlights the significant changes. 
             
    Card income   decreased     $924 million   primarily due to the implementation of new interchange fee rules under the Durbin Amendment, which became effective on October 1, 2011 and the CARD Act provisions that were implemented during 2010. 
                
    Service charges   decreased     $1.3 billion   largely due to the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E, which became effective in the third quarter of 2010. 
                
    Equity investment income   increased     $2.1 billion  . The results for   2011   included   $6.5 billion   of gains on the sale of CCB shares,   $836 million   of CCB dividends and a   $377 million   gain on the sale of our investment in BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock), partially offset by   $1.1 billion   of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture. The prior year included $2.5 billion of net gains which included the sales of certain strategic investments, $2.3 billion of gains in our Global Principal Investments (GPI) portfolio which included both cash gains and fair value adjustments, and   $535 million   of CCB dividends. 
                
    Trading account profits   decreased     $3.4 billion   primarily due to adverse market conditions and extreme volatility in the credit markets compared to the prior year. DVA gains, net of hedges, on derivatives were   $1.0 billion   in   2011   compared to   $262 million   in   2010   as a result of a widening of our credit spreads. In conjunction with regulatory reform measures   GBAM   exited its stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011. Proprietary trading revenue was $434 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 compared to $1.4 billion for   2010  . 
                
    Mortgage banking income   decreased     $11.6 billion   primarily due to an $8.8 billion increase in the representations and warranties provision which was largely related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. Also contributing to the decline was lower production income due to a reduction in new loan origination volumes partially offset by an increase in servicing income. 

Other income   increased     $4.5 billion   primarily due to positive fair value adjustments of   $3.3 billion   related to widening of our own credit spreads on structured liabilities compared to   $18 million   in   2010  . In addition,   2011   included a   $771 million   gain on the sale of Balboa as well as a   $1.2 billion   gain on the exchange of certain trust preferred securities for common stock and debt. 
     Provision for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses   decreased     $15.0 billion   to   $13.4 billion   for   2011   compared to   2010  . The provision for credit losses was   $7.4 billion   lower than net charge-offs for   2011  , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses driven primarily by lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the   Card Services   portfolio, and improvement in overall credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by additions to consumer PCI loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a   $5.9 billion   reduction in the allowance for credit losses in   2010  . We expect reductions in the allowance for credit losses to be lower in 2012.  
  The provision for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio decreased $11.1 billion to $14.3 billion for   2011   compared to   2010  . The provision for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio including the provision for unfunded lending commitments decreased $3.9 billion to a benefit of $915 million for   2011   compared to   2010  . 
  Net charge-offs totaled   $20.8 billion  , or   2.24 percent   of average loans and leases for   2011   compared to   $34.3 billion  , or   3.60 percent   for   2010  . The   decrease   in net charge-offs was primarily driven by improvements in general economic conditions that resulted in lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the   Card Services   portfolio as well as lower losses in the home equity portfolio driven primarily by fewer delinquent loans. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see   Provision for Credit Losses   on page   108  . 
  Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense   decreased     $2.8 billion   to   $80.3 billion   for   2011   compared to   2010  . The prior year included goodwill impairment charges of   $12.4 billion   compared to   $3.2 billion   for   2011  . 
  Personnel expense   increased     $1.8 billion   for   2011   attributable to personnel costs related to the continued build-out of certain businesses, technology costs as well as increases in default- 

Table of Contents  

     related servicing. Additionally, professional fees   increased     $686 million   related to consulting fees for regulatory initiatives as well as higher legal expenses. Other general operating expenses   increased     $4.9 billion   largely as a result of a   $3.0 billion   increase in litigation expense, primarily mortgage-related, and an increase of   $1.6 billion   in mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs. Merger and restructuring expenses   decreased     $1.2 billion   in   2011  . 
  Income Tax Expense 
  The income tax   benefit   was   $1.7 billion   on the pre-tax   loss   of   $230 million   for   2011   compared to income tax   expense   of   $915 million   on the pre-tax   loss   of   $1.3 billion   for   2010  . These amounts are before FTE adjustments. The effective tax rate for   2011   was not meaningful due to a small pre-tax loss, and for   2010  , due to the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges of   $12.4 billion  .  
  The income tax benefit for   2011   was driven by recurring tax preference items, such as tax-exempt income and affordable housing credits, a $1.0 billion benefit from the release of the remaining valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch capital loss carryover deferred tax asset, and a benefit of $823 million for planned realization of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets related to the tax basis in certain subsidiaries. These benefits were partially offset by the $782 million tax charge for the U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions referred to below.  

The $3.2 billion of goodwill impairment charges recorded in   2011   were non-deductible. 
  The effective tax rate for   2010   excluding goodwill impairment charges from pre-tax income was 8.3 percent. In addition to our recurring tax preference items, this rate was driven by a $1.7 billion benefit from the release of a portion of the valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch capital loss carryover deferred tax asset, partially offset by the $392 million charge from a one percent reduction to the U.K. corporate income tax rate enacted during   2010  . 
  On July 19, 2011, the U.K.   2011   Finance Bill was enacted which reduced the corporate income tax rate one percent to 26 percent beginning on April 1, 2011, and then to 25 percent effective April 1, 2012. These rate reductions will favorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings but also required us to remeasure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rates. As noted above, the income tax   benefit   for   2011   included a $782 million charge for the remeasurement, substantially all of which was recorded in   GBAM  . If corporate income tax rates were to be reduced to 23 percent by 2014 as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset balance, a charge to income tax expense of approximately $400 million for each one percent reduction in the rate would result in each period of enactment (for a total of approximately $800 million). 

Balance Sheet Overview 

At   December 31, 2011  , total assets were   $2.1 trillion  , a   decrease   of   $136 billion  , or   six percent  , from   December 31, 2010  . Average total assets   decreased     $143 billion   in   2011  . At   December 31, 2011  , total liabilities were   $1.9 trillion  , a   decrease   of   $138 billion  , or   seven percent  , from   December 31, 2010  . Average total liabilities   decreased     $139 billion   in   2011  . 
  Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities, primarily involving our portfolios of highly  

liquid assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation s risk appetite. The execution of these activities requires the use of balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly in our trading businesses. One of our key metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio, is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets.  

Table of Contents  

     Assets 
  Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell 
  Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell are utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement. Average federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell   decreased     $11.9 billion  , or   five percent  , in   2011   attributable to an overall decline in balance sheet usage. 
  Trading Account Assets 
  Trading account assets consist primarily of fixed-income securities including government and corporate debt, and equity and convertible instruments. Year-end trading account assets   decreased     $25.4 billion   in   2011   primarily due to actions to reduce risk on the balance sheet. Average trading account assets   decreased     $26.4 billion   in   2011   primarily due to a reclassification of noninterest-earning equity securities from trading account assets to other assets for average balance sheet purposes. 
  Debt Securities 
  Debt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, MBS, principally agency MBS, foreign bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns on these investments. Year-end balances of debt securities   decreased     $26.6 billion   due to agency MBS sales in   2011  . Average balances of debt securities   increased     $13.2 billion   due to agency MBS purchases in the second half of   2010   and the first three quarters of   2011  . For additional information on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, see   Note 5   Securities     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Loans and Leases 
  Year-end and average loans and leases   decreased     $14.2 billion   to   $926.2 billion   and   $20.2 billion   to   $938.1 billion   in   2011  . The decrease was primarily due to consumer portfolio run-off outpacing new originations and loan portfolio sales, partially offset by non-U.S. commercial growth as international demand continues to remain high. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio, see   Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
  Year-end and average allowance for loan lease losses   decreased     $8.1 billion   and   $8.0 billion   in   2011   primarily due to the impact of the improving economy partially offset by reserve additions in the PCI portfolio throughout   2011  . For a more detailed discussion of the   Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses  , see page   109  . 
  All Other Assets 
  Year-end and average other assets   decreased     $79.3 billion   and   $105.9 billion   in   2011   driven primarily by the sale of strategic investments, a reduction in loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and lower  

mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Average other assets was also impacted by lower cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. 
  Liabilities 
  Deposits 
  Year-end and average deposits   increased     $22.6 billion   and   $47.2 billion   to   $1.0 trillion   in   2011  . The increase was attributable to growth in our noninterest-bearing deposits. 
  Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 
  Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. Year-end and average federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase   decreased     $30.5 billion   and   $81.3 billion   in   2011   primarily due to planned funding reductions. 
  Trading Account Liabilities 
  Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in fixed-income securities including government and corporate debt, equity and convertible instruments. Year-end and average trading account liabilities   decreased     $11.5 billion   and   $7.0 billion   in   2011   in line with declines in trading account assets. 
  Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings 
  Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings provide an additional funding source. Year-end and average commercial paper and other short-term borrowings   decreased     $24.3 billion   to   $35.7 billion   and   $24.8 billion   to   $51.9 billion   in   2011   due to planned reductions in wholesale borrowings. During 2011, we reduced to an insignificant amount our use of unsecured short-term borrowings including commercial paper and master notes.  
  Long-term Debt 
  Year-end and average long-term debt   decreased     $76.2 billion   to   $372.3 billion   and   $69.3 billion   to   $421.2 billion   in   2011  . The   decreases   were attributable to the Corporation s strategy to reduce our debt footprint. For additional information on long-term debt, see   Note 13   Long-term Debt     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  All Other Liabilities 
  Year-end all other liabilities   decreased     $17.9 billion   in   2011   driven primarily by a decline in the liability related to collateral held, a decrease in lower customer margin credits and liquidation of a consolidated variable interest entity (VIE). 
  Shareholders  Equity 
  Year-end shareholders  equity   increased     $1.9 billion  . The increase was driven primarily by the investment by Berkshire, exchanges of certain preferred securities for common stock and debt and positive earnings. Average shareholders  equity   decreased     $4.1 billion   in   2011   primarily driven by losses late in   2010  .

     Cash Flows Overview 
  The Corporation s operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the AFS securities portfolio and other short-term investments. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to increased customer deposits and net long-term debt repayments. 
  Cash and cash equivalents   increased     $11.7 billion   during   2011   due to sales of non-core assets and net sales of AFS securities partially offset by repayment and maturities of certain long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents   decreased     $12.9 billion   during   2010   due to repayment and maturities of certain long-term debt  

and net purchases of AFS securities partially offset by deposit growth. 
  During   2011  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $64.5 billion   compared to   $82.6 billion   in   2010  . The more significant adjustments to net income (loss) to arrive at cash provided by operating activities included the provision for credit losses, goodwill impairment charges and the net decrease in trading and derivative instruments. 
  During   2011  , net cash provided by investing activities increased to   $52.4 billion   primarily driven by net sales of debt securities. During   2010  , net cash of   $30.3 billion   was used in investing activities primarily for net purchases of debt securities. 
  During   2011   and   2010  , the net cash used in financing activities of   $104.7 billion   and   $65.4 billion   primarily reflected the net decreases in long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances.

     Supplemental Financial Data 
  We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on a FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
  As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds.  
  We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders  equity or common shareholders  equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use Return on average tangible shareholders  equity (ROTE) as key measures to support our overall growth goals.  
             
    Return on average tangible common shareholders  equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders  equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities (CES). The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted common shareholders  equity plus any CES divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding  

MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.  
             
    ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average shareholders  equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted total shareholders  equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. 
                
    Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders  equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 
     In addition, we evaluate our business segment results based on measures that utilize return on average economic capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, including the following:  
             
    Return on average economic capital for the segments is calculated as net income, adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average economic capital.  
                
    Economic capital represents allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets (excluding MSRs).  
     The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables   7   and   8   and Statistical Tables XII and XIV. In addition, in Table   8   and Statistical Table XIV, we have excluded the impact of goodwill impairment charges of   $3.2 billion   and   $12.4 billion   recorded in   2011   and   2010   when presenting certain of these metrics. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP financial measures.  
  Statistical Tables XV, XVI and XVII provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation and our segments. Other companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently.

     Core Net Interest Income 
  We manage core net interest income which is reported net interest income on a FTE basis adjusted for the impact of market-based activities. As discussed in the   GBAM   business segment section on page   49  , we evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for   GBAM  .   An analysis of core net interest income, core average earning assets and core net interest yield on earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of market-based activities from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation in   Table 9   provides additional clarity in assessing our results. 

(2)   
    Represents the impact of market-based amounts included in   GBAM  . 
       
  Core net interest income   decreased     $6.5 billion   to   $41.8 billion   for   2011   compared to   2010  . The   decline   was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment security yields, including the acceleration of purchase premium amortization from an increase in modeled prepayment expectations and increased hedge ineffectiveness. These decreases were partially offset by ongoing reductions in our debt footprint and lower interest rates paid on deposits. 
  Core average earning assets   increased     $1.1 billion   to   $1,385.9 billion   for   2011   compared to   2010  . The   increase   was primarily due to growth in investment securities partially offset by declines in consumer loans. 
  Core net interest yield   decreased     48   bps to   3.01 percent   for   2011   compared to   2010   primarily due to the factors noted above. In addition, the yield curve flattened significantly with long-term rates near historical lows at   December 31, 2011  . This has resulted in net interest yield compression as assets have repriced down and liability yields have declined less significantly due to the absolute low level of short-end rates. 
    Business Segment Operations 
  Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 
  We report the results of our operations through six business segments:   Deposits  ,   Card Services  ,   CRES  ,   Global Commercial Banking  ,   GBAM   and   GWIM  , with the remaining operations recorded in   All Other  .  
  We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP financial measures, many of which are discussed in  

Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38  . We begin by evaluating the operating results of the segments which by definition exclude merger and restructuring charges. 
  The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. 
  Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. For presentation purposes, in segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of our ALM activities. 
  Our ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The majority of our ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on performance. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities. 
  Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization. 
  Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment s credit, market, interest rate, strategic and operational risk components. The nature of these risks is discussed further on page   68  . We benefit from the diversification of risk across these components which is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment. The total amount of average allocated equity reflects both risk-based capital and the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the business segments. The risk-adjusted methodology is periodically refined and such refinements are reflected as changes to allocated equity in each segment. 
  For more information on selected financial information for the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income (loss) and year-end total assets, see   Note 26   Business Segment Information     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  .

    Return on average economic capital and economic capital are non-GAAP financial measures. For additional information on these measures, see   Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38   and for corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see Statistical Table XVI. 
       
    Deposits   includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity for the Corporation. We earn net interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and implied maturity of the deposits.  
  Deposits   also generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at clients with less than $250,000 in total assets. Merrill Edge provides team-based investment advice and guidance, brokerage services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation s network of banking centers and ATMs.   Deposits   includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between   Deposits   and other client-managed businesses.  

Net income   decreased     $170 million   to   $1.2 billion   in   2011   compared to   2010   due to a   decrease   in revenue partially offset by a   decrease   in noninterest expense. Revenue of   $12.7 billion   was   down     $873 million   from a year ago primarily driven by a decline in service charges reflecting the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E that were fully implemented during the third quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by an   increase   in net interest income due to a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline. Noninterest expense   decreased     $563 million  , or   five percent  , to   $10.6 billion   due to lower litigation and operating expenses partially offset by an increase in FDIC expense.  
  Average deposits   increased     $6.2 billion   from a year ago driven by a customer shift to more liquid products in a low interest rate environment as checking, traditional savings and money market savings grew $23.6 billion. Growth in liquid products was partially offset by a decline in average time deposits of $17.4 billion. As a result of the shift in the mix of deposits and our continued pricing discipline, rates paid on average deposits declined by 16 bps to 27 bps in   2011   compared to   2010  .

    Card Services   is one of the leading issuers of credit and debit cards in the U.S. to consumers and small businesses providing a broad offering of lending products including co-branded and affinity products. During   2011  , we sold our Canadian consumer card business and we are evaluating our remaining international consumer card operations. In light of these actions, the international consumer card business results were moved to   All Other  , prior period results have been reclassified and the   Global Card Services   business segment was renamed   Card Services  . 
  During   2010   and   2011  ,   Card Services   was negatively impacted by provisions of the CARD Act. The majority of the provisions of the CARD Act became effective on February 22, 2010, while certain provisions became effective in the third quarter of 2010. The CARD Act has negatively impacted net interest income due to restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. 
  On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule with respect to the Durbin Amendment, effective October 1, 2011, that established the maximum allowable interchange fees a bank can receive for a debit card transaction. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements, with which we are currently in compliance. In addition, the Federal Reserve approved rules governing routing and exclusivity, requiring issuers to offer two  

unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product, which are effective April 1, 2012. For more information on the final interchange rules, see   Regulatory Matters   on page   66  . The new interchange fee rules resulted in a reduction of debit card revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 of   $430 million  . 
  Net income   increased     $12.8 billion   to   $5.8 billion   in   2011   primarily due to the   $10.4 billion   goodwill impairment charge in   2010  , and a   $7.9 billion     decrease   in the provision for credit losses in   2011  . This was partially offset by a   decrease   in revenue of   $4.2 billion  , or   19 percent  , to   $18.1 billion   in   2011   compared to   2010  . 
  Net interest income   decreased     $2.9 billion  , or   20 percent  , to   $11.5 billion   in   2011   compared to   2010   driven by lower average loan balances and yields. The net interest yield   decreased     81   bps to   9.04 percent   due to charge-offs and paydowns of higher interest rate products. Noninterest income   decreased     $1.3 billion  , or   16 percent  , to   $6.6 billion   in   2011   compared to   2010   due to the implementation of the Durbin Amendment on October 1, 2011, the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position in   2010   and the implementation of the CARD Act in   2010  . 
  The provision for credit losses   decreased     $7.9 billion   to   $3.1 billion   in   2011   compared to   2010   reflecting improving delinquencies and collections, and fewer bankruptcies as a result of improving economic conditions, and lower loan balances. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see   Provision for Credit Losses   on page   108  . 

Table of Contents  

     The return on average economic capital   increased   due to higher net income and a decrease in average economic capital. Average economic capital   decreased     29 percent   due to lower levels of credit risk from a decline in loan balances as well as an improvement in credit quality. Average allocated equity decreased primarily due to the   $10.4 billion   goodwill impairment charge in   2010   as well as the same reasons as the decrease in economic  

capital. For more information regarding economic capital and allocated equity, see   Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38  . 
  Average loans   decreased     $19.0 billion  , or   13 percent  , in   2011   compared to   2010   driven by higher payments, charge-offs, continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the impact of portfolio divestitures during   2011  .

    CRES   was realigned effective January 1, 2011 and its activities are now referred to as Home Loans, Legacy Asset Servicing and Other. This realignment allows   CRES   management to lead the ongoing home loan business while also providing greater focus and transparency on legacy mortgage issues. 
  CRES   generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide.   CRES   products include fixed- and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while we retain MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on our balance sheet in   All Other   for ALM purposes. HELOC and home equity loans are retained on the   CRES   balance sheet.   CRES   services mortgage loans, including those loans it owns, loans owned by other business segments and   All Other  , and loans owned by outside investors. 
  The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the business segment that owns the loans or   All Other  .   CRES   is not impacted by the Corporation s first mortgage production retention decisions as   CRES   is compensated for loans held for  

ALM purposes on a management accounting basis, with a corresponding offset recorded in   All Other,   and for servicing loans owned by other business segments and   All Other  . 
  CRES   includes the impact of transferring customers and their related loan balances between   GWIM   and   CRES   based on client segmentation thresholds. For more information on the migration of customer balances, see   GWIM   on page   52  . 
  Home Loans 
  Home Loans products are available to our customers through our retail network of approximately   5,700   banking centers, mortgage loan officers in approximately 500 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. These products were also offered through our correspondent lending channel; however, we exited this channel in late 2011. In 2011, we also exited the reverse mortgage origination business. In October 2010, we exited the first mortgage wholesale acquisition channel. These strategic changes were made to allow greater focus on our direct to consumer channels, deepen relationships with existing customers and use mortgage products to acquire new relationships. 

Table of Contents  

     Home Loans includes ongoing loan production activities, certain servicing activities and the   CRES   home equity portfolio not originally selected for inclusion in the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio  .   Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, and disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties along with responding to non-default related customer inquiries. Home Loans also included insurance operations through June 30, 2011, when the ongoing insurance business was transferred to   Card Services   following the sale of Balboa. 
  Due to the realignment of   CRES  , the composition of the Home Loans loan portfolio does not currently reflect a normalized level of credit losses and noninterest expense which we expect will develop over time. 
  Legacy Asset Servicing 
  Legacy Asset Servicing is responsible for servicing and managing the exposures related to selected residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios. These selected loan portfolios include owned loans and loans serviced for others, including loans held in other business segments and   All Other   (collectively, the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio). The Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio includes residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and discontinued real estate loans that would not have been originated under our underwriting standards at December 31, 2010. Countrywide loans that were impaired at the time of acquisition (the Countrywide PCI portfolio) as well as certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011 are also included in the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio. Since determining the pool of loans to be included in the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio as of January 1, 2011, the criteria have not changed for this portfolio. However, the criteria for inclusion of certain assets and liabilities in the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio will continue to be evaluated over time. 
  Legacy Asset Servicing results reflect the net cost of legacy exposures that is included in the results of   CRES  , including representations and warranties provision, litigation costs, and financial results of the   CRES   home equity portfolio selected as part of the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio. In addition, certain revenues and expenses on loans serviced for others, including loans serviced for other business segments and   All Other  , are included in Legacy Asset Servicing results. The results of the Legacy Asset Servicing residential mortgage and discontinued real estate portfolios are recorded primarily in   All Other  . 
  Our home retention efforts are part of our servicing activities, along with supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. These default-related activities are performed by Legacy Asset Servicing. In an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure, Legacy Asset Servicing evaluates various workout options prior to foreclosure sales which, combined with our temporary halt of foreclosures announced in October 2010, has resulted in elongated default timelines. For additional information on our servicing activities and foreclosures, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Other Mortgage-related Matters   on page   63 
  The total owned loans in the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio   decreased     $15.7 billion   in 2011 to   $154.9 billion   at   December 31, 2011  , of which   $60.0 billion   are reflected on the balance sheet  

of Legacy Asset Servicing within   CRES   and the remainder are held on the balance sheet of   All Other  . 
  Other 
  The Other component within   CRES   includes the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results, together with any related assets or liabilities used as economic hedges. The change in the value of the MSRs reflects the change in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, as well as the effect of changes in other assumptions, including the cost to service. These amounts are not allocated between Home Loans and Legacy Asset Servicing since the MSRs are managed as a single asset. For additional information on MSRs, see   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . Goodwill assigned to   CRES   was included in Other; however, the remaining balance of goodwill was written off in its entirety in 2011. 
  CRES   Results 
  The   CRES     net loss     increased     $10.6 billion   to   $19.5 billion   in 2011 compared to 2010. Revenue   declined     $13.5 billion   to   a loss of     $3.2 billion   due in large part to a   decrease   of   $11.4 billion   in mortgage banking income driven by an   increase   in representations and warranties provision of   $8.8 billion   and a   decrease   in core production income of   $3.4 billion   in 2011.  
  The representations and warranties provision in 2011 included   $8.6 billion   related to the BNY Mellon Settlement and   $7.0 billion   related to other exposures. For additional information on representations and warranties, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Representations and Warranties   on page   56   and   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . The   decrease   in core production income was due to a decline in loan funding volume caused primarily by a drop in market share, which reflected decisions to price certain loan products in order to align the volume of new loan applications with our underwriting capacity in both the retail and correspondent channels and our exit from the correspondent channel in late 2011. Also contributing to the   decline   in revenue was a   $1.3 billion     decrease   in insurance income due to the sale of Balboa in 2011 and a   decline   in net interest income primarily due to lower average LHFS balances. Revenue for 2011 also included a pre-tax gain on the sale of Balboa of $752 million, net of an inter-segment advisory fee. 
  The provision for credit losses   decreased     $4.0 billion   to   $4.5 billion   in 2011 compared to 2010 driven primarily by improving portfolio trends, including lower reserve additions in the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio. 
  Noninterest expense   increased     $7.0 billion   to   $21.9 billion   in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a   $3.6 billion     increase   in litigation expense,   $1.6 billion   higher mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, higher default-related and other loss mitigation servicing expenses and a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of   $2.6 billion   in 2011 compared to a   $2.0 billion   goodwill impairment charge in 2010. 
  In 2011, we recorded   $1.8 billion   of mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, which included   $1.3 billion   for compensatory fees as a result of elongated default timelines. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 billion in insurance expense due to the sale of Balboa and a decline of $640 million in production expense primarily due to lower origination volumes. 

Table of Contents  

     Compensatory fees are fees that we expect to be assessed by the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (collectively, the GSEs), as a result of foreclosure delays pursuant to first mortgage seller/servicer guides with the GSEs which provide timelines to complete the liquidation of delinquent loans. In instances where we fail to meet these timelines, our agreements provide the GSEs with the option to assess compensatory fees. The remainder of the mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs are out-of-pocket costs that we do not expect to recover. We expect these costs will remain elevated as additional loans are delayed in the foreclosure process. We also expect that continued elevated costs, including costs related to resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessments and to implement other operational changes, will continue. 
  Average economic capital decreased   30 percent   due to a reduction in credit risk driven by lower loan balances, and the sale of Balboa. Average allocated equity decreased for the same reasons as economic capital as well as the goodwill impairment charges in 2011 and 2010. For more information regarding economic capital and allocated equity, see   Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38  . 
  Mortgage Banking Income 
  CRES   mortgage banking income is categorized into production and servicing income. Core production income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and LHFS, the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. In addition, production income includes revenue, which is offset in   All Other,   for transfers of mortgage loans from   CRES   to the ALM portfolio related to the Corporation s mortgage production retention decisions. Ongoing costs related to representations and warranties and other obligations that were incurred in the sales of mortgage loans in prior periods are also included in production income. 

Servicing income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of economic hedge activities. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense. 
  The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income. 

(1)   
    Represents the change in the market value of the MSR asset due to the impact of customer payments received during the year. 
               (2)   
    Includes sale of MSRs. 
               (3)   
    Includes the effect of transfers of mortgage loans from   CRES   to the ALM portfolio in   All Other  . 
       
  Core production revenue of   $2.8 billion   in 2011   decreased     $3.4 billion   from 2010 due primarily to lower new loan origination volumes. The 52 percent decline in new loan originations was caused primarily by a drop in market share, as previously discussed, combined with the decline in the overall market demand for mortgages from 2010 to 2011. The representations and warranties provision   increased     $8.8 billion   to   $15.6 billion   in 2011 due to the BNY Mellon Settlement and other exposures. 
  Net servicing income   increased     $834 million   in 2011 due to a lower impact of customer payments partially offset by lower servicing fees driven by a decline in the servicing portfolio. Improved MSR results, net of hedges also contributed to the increase in net servicing income.

    In addition to loan production in   CRES  , the remaining first mortgage and home equity loan production is primarily in   GWIM. 
               (2)   
    Servicing of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and discontinued real estate mortgage loans. 
        
  First mortgage production was   $151.8 billion   in   2011   compared to   $298.0 billion   in   2010   with the   decrease   primarily due to a reduction in both the correspondent and retail sales channels. Additionally, the overall industry market demand for mortgages dropped by approximately 17 percent in 2011,  

contributing to the decline in mortgage production. We expect our market share of mortgage originations in 2012 to be lower than our market share in 2011, due to our exit from the correspondent channel. 
  Home equity production was   $4.4 billion   in   2011   compared to   $8.4 billion   in   2010   with the decrease primarily due to a decline in reverse mortgage originations based on our decision to exit this business in 2011. 
  At   December 31, 2011  , the consumer MSR balance was   $7.4 billion  , which represented   54   bps of the related unpaid principal balance compared to   $14.9 billion   or   92   bps of the related unpaid principal balance at   December 31, 2010  . The decline in the consumer MSR balance was primarily driven by lower mortgage rates, which resulted in higher forecasted prepayment speeds combined with the impact of elevated expected costs to service delinquent loans, which reduced expected cash flows and the value of the MSRs, and MSR sales. In addition, the MSRs declined as a result of customer payments. These declines were partially offset by adjustments to prepayment models to reflect muted refinancing activity relative to historic norms and by the addition of new MSRs recorded in connection with sales of loans. During   2011  , MSRs in the amount of   $896 million   were sold. Gains recognized on these transactions were not significant. These sales were undertaken to reduce the balance of MSRs, lower our default-related servicing costs and reduce risk in certain portfolios in preparation of the implementation of Basel III. For additional information on Basel III, see   Capital Management   Regulatory Capital Changes   on page   73   and for information on MSRs and the related hedge instruments, see   Mortgage Banking Risk Management   on page   119   and   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  .

    Global Commercial Banking   provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners. Our clients include business banking and middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms and governments, and are generally defined as companies with annual sales up to $2 billion. Our lending products and services include commercial loans and commitment facilities, real estate lending, asset-based lending and indirect consumer loans. Our capital management and treasury solutions include treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options.     Effective in 2011, management responsibility for the merchant services joint venture,   Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC  , was moved from   GBAM   to   Global Commercial Banking   where it more closely aligns with the business model. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change. In   2011  , we recorded   $1.1 billion   of impairment charges on our investment in the joint venture. Because of the recent transfer of the joint venture to   Global Commercial Banking  , the impairment charges were recorded in   All Other  .   For additional information, see   Note 5   Securities     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 

Net income   increased     $1.2 billion   to   $4.4 billion   in   2011   from   2010   primarily driven by an improvement in the provision for credit losses, offset by lower revenue and higher expenses. 
  Revenue   decreased     $673 million   primarily driven by   lower   net interest income related to ALM activities and   lower   average loan balances, partially offset by an   increase   in average deposits as clients continue to maintain high levels of liquidity. Noninterest income   increased     $158 million   largely due to a gain on the termination of a purchase contract, an increase in tax credit and commercial card income, and higher investment gains in the commercial real estate portfolio.  
  The provision for credit losses decreased   $2.6 billion   to a benefit of   $634 million   for   2011   compared to   2010  . The   decrease   was driven by improved economic conditions and an accelerated rate of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio. 
  Noninterest expense   increased     $104 million   driven primarily by higher FDIC expense.  
  The return on average economic capital   increased   due to higher net income and the   12 percent   decrease in average economic capital. Economic capital decreased due to declining loan balances and improvements in credit quality. Average allocated equity decreased due to the same reasons as economic capital. For more information regarding economic capital and allocated equity, see   Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38  . 

Table of Contents  

     Global Commercial Banking Revenue 
  Global Commercial Banking   revenue can also be categorized into treasury services revenue primarily from capital and treasury management, and business lending revenue derived from credit related products and services as shown in the table below.    

Treasury services revenue increased   $113 million   to   $4.9 billion  , driven by increased net interest income from the funding benefit of   increased   deposits, partially offset by lower treasury service charges. As clients manage through current economic conditions, we have seen usage of certain treasury services decline and increased conversion of paper to electronic services. These actions combined with our clients leveraging compensating balances to offset fees have decreased treasury service charges.  
  Business lending revenue   decreased     $786 million   to   $5.7 billion   due to lower net interest income related to ALM activities and lower loan balances. Average loan and lease balances   decreased     $14.4 billion   to   $189.4 billion   as commercial real estate net paydowns and sales outpaced new originations and renewals.

    GBAM   provides advisory services, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide debt and equity underwriting and distribution capabilities, merger-related and other advisory services, and risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage positions in government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, MBS and asset-backed securities (ABS). Underwriting debt and equity issuances, fixed-income and equity research, and certain market-based activities are executed through our global broker/dealer affiliates which are our primary dealers in several countries.   GBAM   is a leader in the global distribution of fixed-income, currency and energy commodity products and derivatives.   GBAM   also has one of the largest equity trading operations in the world and is a leader in the origination  

and distribution of equity and equity-related products. Our corporate banking services provide a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners. Our corporate clients are generally defined as companies with annual sales greater than $2 billion. 
  Net income   decreased     $3.3 billion   to   $3.0 billion   in   2011   primarily driven by a   decline   of   $4.2 billion   in sales and trading revenue. The decrease in sales and trading revenue was due to a challenging market environment, partially offset by DVA gains, net of hedges. In   2011  , DVA gains, net of hedges, were   $1.0 billion   compared to   $262 million   in   2010   due to the widening of our credit spreads. 
  The provision for credit losses   decreased     $130 million   to a benefit of   $296 million   in   2011   from a benefit of   $166 million   in   2010   driven by the positive impact of the economic environment on the credit portfolio. Noninterest expense   increased     $644 million   driven primarily by higher costs related to investments in infrastructure.

     Income tax expense included a $774 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets as a result of a reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate enacted during   2011   compared to a charge of $388 million for a rate reduction enacted in   2010  . For additional information related to the U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction, see   Financial Highlights   Income Tax Expense   on page   34  . 
  The return on average economic capital   decreased   due to lower net income partially offset by a   33 percent     decrease   in average economic capital due to reductions in credit risk driven by improved risk ratings, lower counterparty credit risk and a decline in market risk-related trading exposures. Average allocated equity decreased due to the same reasons as economic capital. For more information regarding economic capital and allocated equity, see   Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38  . 
  Sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees may continue to be adversely affected in 2012 by lower client activity and challenging market conditions as a result of, among other things, the European sovereign debt crisis, uncertainty regarding the outcome of the evolving domestic regulatory landscape, our credit ratings and market volatility. 
  Components of Global Banking   Markets 
  Sales and Trading Revenue 
  Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed income including investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), swaps and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs); currencies including interest rate and foreign exchange contracts; commodities including primarily futures, forwards and options; and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.

    Includes a FTE adjustment of   $202 million   and   $274 million   for   2011   and   2010  . For additional information on sales and trading revenue, including sales and trading investment and brokerage services and net interest income, see   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
       
  Fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) revenue   decreased     $4.0 billion  , or   31 percent  , to   $8.9 billion   in   2011 compared to 2010   primarily due to lower client activity and continued adverse market conditions impacting our mortgage products, credit, and rates and currencies businesses, partially offset by DVA gains, net of hedges. Equity income   decreased     $187 million  , or   five percent  , to   $4.0 billion   in   2011 compared to 2010   primarily due to lower equity derivative trading volumes. Sales and trading revenue included total commissions and brokerage fee revenue of   $2.3 billion   (  $2.2 billion   from equities and   $144 million   from FICC) in   2011   compared to   $2.4 billion   (  $2.2 billion   from equities and   $148 million   from FICC) in   2010  . 
  In conjunction with regulatory reform measures and our initiative to optimize our balance sheet, we exited our stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011, which involved trading activities in a variety of products, including stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Proprietary trading revenue was $434 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 compared  

to $1.4 billion for   2010  . For additional information on restrictions on proprietary trading, see   Regulatory Matters   Limitations on Proprietary Trading   on page   66  . 
  Investment Banking Fees 
  Product specialists within   GBAM   provide advisory services, and underwrite and distribute debt and equity issuances and other loan products. The table below presents total investment banking fees for   GBAM   which represent a majority of the Corporation s total investment banking income, with the remainder reported in   GWIM   and   Global Commercial Banking  . 

(2)   
    Advisory includes fees on debt and equity advisory services and mergers and acquisitions. 
       
  Investment banking fees   decreased     $164 million   in   2011 compared to 2010   primarily driven by lower debt issuance fees due to challenging market conditions partially offset by higher advisory fees.  
  Global Corporate Banking 
  Client relationship teams along with product partners work with our customers to provide a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions through the Corporation s global network of offices. The table below presents total net revenue, total average deposits, and total average loans and leases for Global Corporate Banking. 

Global Corporate Banking revenue of   $5.5 billion   for   2011   remained in line with   2010  . Global Treasury Services revenue   increased     $189 million   in   2011 compared to 2010   as growth in U.S. and non-U.S. deposit volumes was partially offset by a challenging rate environment. Business Lending revenues   decreased     $180 million   in   2011   as growth in loans was offset by a declining rate environment and lower accretion on acquired portfolios due to the impact of prepayments in prior periods. 
  Global Corporate Banking average deposits   increased     21 percent   in   2011 compared to 2010   as balances continued to grow due to clients  excess liquidity and limited alternative investment options. Average loan and lease balances in Global Corporate Banking   increased     20 percent   in   2011   due to growth in the commercial loan and non-U.S. trade finance portfolios driven by continuing international demand and improved domestic momentum.

     Collateralized Debt Obligation and Monoline Exposure 
  CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including commercial paper, and mezzanine and equity securities. Our CDO-related exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded super senior liquidity commitment exposure and other super senior exposure, including cash positions and derivative contracts. For more information on our CDO positions, see   Note 8   Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . Super senior exposure represents the most senior class of notes that are issued by the CDO vehicles and benefits from the subordination of all other securities issued by the CDO vehicles. In   2011  , we recorded losses of $86 million from our CDO-related exposure compared to losses of $573 million in   2010  . 
  At   December 31, 2011  , our super senior CDO exposure before consideration of insurance, net of write-downs, was   $376 million  , comprised solely of trading account assets, compared to   $2.0 billion  , comprised of   $1.3 billion   in trading account assets and   $675 million   in AFS debt securities at   December 31, 2010  . Of our super senior CDO exposure at   December 31, 2011  ,   $224 million   was hedged and   $152 million   was unhedged compared to   $772 million   hedged and   $1.2 billion   unhedged at   December 31, 2010  . At   December 31, 2011  , there were no unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) on super senior cash positions and retained positions from liquidated CDOs compared to $466 million at   December 31, 2010  . The change was the result of sales of ABS CDOs.  
  With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs and recorded in   All Other.   For additional information, see   All Other   on page   54  . 
  Excluding amounts related to transactions with a single counterparty, which were transferred to other assets as discussed  

below, the table below presents our original total notional, mark-to-market receivable and credit valuation adjustment for credit default swaps (CDS) and other positions with monolines.   

Total monoline exposure, net of credit valuation adjustments,   decreased     $2.6 billion   to   $1.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   driven by terminated monoline contracts and the reclassification of certain exposures. During   2011  , we terminated all of our monoline contracts referencing super senior ABS CDOs and reclassified net monoline exposure with a carrying value of   $1.3 billion   (  $4.7 billion   gross receivable less impairment) at   December 31, 2011   from derivative assets to other assets because of the inherent default risk. Because these contracts no longer provide a hedge benefit, they are no longer considered derivative trading instruments. This exposure relates to a single counterparty and is recorded at fair value based on current net recovery projections. The net recovery projections take into account the present value of projected payments expected to be received from the counterparty.

    GWIM   consists of three primary businesses:   Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM); U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust);   and   Retirement Services  . 
  MLGWM s   advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of more than 17,000 financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets.   MLGWM   provides tailored solutions to meet our clients  needs through a full set of brokerage, banking and retirement products in both domestic and international locations. 
  U.S. Trust  , together with   MLGWM s   Private Banking   Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted at wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $5 million, as well as customized solutions to meet clients  wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services. 

Retirement Services   partners with financial advisors to provide institutional and personal retirement solutions including investment management, administration, recordkeeping and custodial services for 401(k), pension, profit-sharing, equity award and non-qualified deferred compensation plans  . Retirement Services   also provides comprehensive investment advisory services to individuals, small to large corporations and pension plans. 
  In   2011  , revenue from   MLGWM   was   $13.5 billion  ,   up     eight percent   from   2010   driven by an increase in asset management fees, due to higher average market levels, and long-term AUM flows, as well as higher net interest income. Revenue from   U.S. Trust   was   $2.7 billion  , which remained relatively unchanged from   2010   as an increase in asset management fees primarily from higher market levels was partially offset by lower net interest income. Revenue from   Retirement Services   was   $1.0 billion  ,   up     11 percent   compared to   2010   primarily due to higher market levels.

     GWIM   results are impacted by the migration of clients and their related deposit and loan balances to or from   Deposits  ,   CRES   and the ALM portfolio, as presented in the Migration Summary table. Migration in   2011   included the movement of balances to Merrill Edge, which is in   Deposits  . Subsequent to the date of the migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the clients migrated. 

Net income   increased     $295 million  , or   22 percent  , to   $1.6 billion   in   2011 compared to 2010   driven by higher net interest income, higher asset management fees and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income   increased     $369 million  , or   six percent  , to   $6.0 billion   as the impact of higher average deposit balances more than offset the impact of a lower rate environment. Noninterest income   increased     $718 million  , or   seven percent  , to   $11.3 billion   primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by higher average market levels in  

2011   compared to   2010   and continued long-term AUM flows. The provision for credit losses   decreased     $248 million  , or   38 percent  , to   $398 million   driven by improving portfolio trends. Noninterest expense   increased     $1.2 billion  , or   nine percent  , to   $14.4 billion   due to increased volume-driven expenses and personnel costs associated with continued investment in the business. 
  Client Balances 
  The table below presents client balances which consist of AUM, client brokerage assets, assets in custody, client deposits, and loans and leases. 

The   decrease   in client balances was driven by lower broad based market levels at   December 31, 2011   compared to   December 31, 2010   partially offset by client inflows, particularly into long-term AUM.

    For presentation purposes, in segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated equity. Such allocated assets were $662.2 billion and $613.3 billion for   2011   and   2010  , and   $531.7 billion   and   $476.5 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . The allocation can result in total assets of less than total loans and leases in   All Other  .

    All Other   consists of two broad groupings,   Equity Investments   and   Other  .   Equity Investments   includes GPI, Strategic and other investments, and Corporate Investments.   Other   includes liquidating businesses, merger and restructuring charges, ALM functions such as the residential mortgage portfolio and investment securities, and related activities including economic hedges and gains/losses on structured liabilities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness.   Other   also includes certain residential mortgage and discontinued real estate loans that are managed by Legacy Asset Servicing within   CRES  . During   2011  , we sold our Canadian consumer card business and we are evaluating our remaining international consumer card operations. As a result of these actions, we reclassified results from these businesses, including prior periods, from   Card Services   to   All Other  . For additional information on the other activities included in   All Other  , see   Note 26   Business Segment Information     to the Consolidated Financial  

Statements  . 
  All Other   reported   net income   of   $5.0 billion   in   2011   compared to   $1.5 billion   in   2010   with the increase primarily due to higher noninterest income and lower merger and restructuring charges. Noninterest income increased due to positive fair value adjustments related to our own credit on structured liabilities of   $3.3 billion   in   2011   compared to   $18 million   in   2010  . Equity investment income   increased     $2.5 billion   as a result of a   $6.5 billion   gain from the sale of CCB shares (we currently hold approximately one percent of the outstanding common shares) partially offset by   $1.1 billion   of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture and a decrease of   $1.9 billion   in GPI income. A non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of   $581 million   was taken during the   fourth quarter of 2011   as a result of a change in the estimated value of the European consumer card business. The prior year included   $1.2 billion   of gains on the sales of certain strategic investments. The provision  

Table of Contents  

     for credit losses   decreased     $150 million   to   $6.2 billion   driven by lower balances due primarily to divestitures; improvements in delinquencies, collections and insolvencies in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio; and continued run-off in the legacy Merrill Lynch commercial portfolio. These increases were largely offset by reserve additions to the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate and residential mortgage portfolios and higher credit costs related to the non-PCI residential mortgage portfolio due primarily to the continuing decline in home prices.  
  The income tax   benefit   was   $879 million   compared to a   benefit   of   $3.9 billion   for   2010  . The factors affecting taxes in   All Other   are discussed more fully in   Financial Highlights   Income Tax Expense   on page   34  .  
  With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs, with a current carrying value of $3.1 billion at   December 31, 2011  , down from $4.2 billion at   December 31, 2010   primarily due to paydowns. The loan is recorded in   All Other   and all scheduled payments on the loan have been received to date. The loan matures in September 2023.

  The tables below present the components of the equity investments in   All Other   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , and also a reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for   2011   and   2010  . 

Equity investments included in   All Other     decreased     $27.3 billion   during   2011   consistent with our continued efforts to reduce non-core assets including reducing both higher risk-weighted assets and assets currently deducted, or expected to be deducted under Basel III, from regulatory capital. For more information, see   Capital Management   Regulatory Capital Changes   on page   73  . 
  GPI is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. GPI had unfunded equity commitments of $710 million and $1.4 billion at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   related to certain of these investments. The Corporation has actively reduced these commitments in a series of transactions involving its private equity fund investments. 
  Strategic and other investments included in   All Other     decreased     $21.2 billion   during   2011  . The decrease was primarily the result of the sale of CCB shares and all of our investment in BlackRock during   2011  . In connection with the sale of our investment in CCB, we recorded gains of   $6.5 billion  . At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , we owned   2.0 billion   shares and   25.6 billion   shares representing approximately   one percent   and   10 percent   of CCB. Sales restrictions on the remaining   2.0 billion   CCB shares continue until August 2013 and accordingly these shares are carried at cost. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the cost basis of our total investment in CCB was   $716 million   and   $9.2 billion  , the carrying value was   $716 million   and   $19.7 billion  , and the fair value was   $1.4 billion   and   $20.8 billion  . During   2011   and   2010  , we recorded dividends of   $836 million   and   $535 million   from CCB. During   2011  , we sold our remaining ownership interest of approximately   13.6 million   preferred shares, or   seven percent   of BlackRock. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of   $377 million  . For more information, see   Note 5   Securities     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  During   2011  , we recorded   $1.1 billion   of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture. The joint venture had a carrying value of   $3.4 billion   and   $4.7 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   with the reduction in carrying value primarily the result of the impairment charges. The impairment charges were based on the ongoing financial performance of the joint venture and updated forecasts of its long-term financial performance. Because of the recent transfer of the joint venture investment from   GBAM   to   Global Commercial Banking  , the impairment charges were recorded in   All Other  .

     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
  We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations. Included in purchase obligations are commitments to purchase loans of   $2.5 billion   and vendor contracts of   $15.7 billion  . The most significant vendor contracts include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension Plans, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans (the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected  

obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans  assets and any participant contributions, if applicable. During   2011   and   2010  , we contributed   $287 million   and   $395 million   to the Plans, and we expect to make at least   $337 million   of contributions during   2012  . 
  Debt, lease, equity and other obligations are more fully discussed in   Note 13   Long-term Debt   and   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . The Plans are more fully discussed in   Note 19   Employee Benefit Plans     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. For a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see the table in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Table 10   presents total long-term debt and other obligations at   December 31, 2011  . 

Representations and Warranties 
  We securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of the FHA-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monolines or financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities), or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan buyers, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In such cases, we would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guaranty payments that we may receive. 
  Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable sales and securitization agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced by the GSEs, HUD, VA, the whole-loan buyer, the securitization trustee or others as governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien and home equity  

securitizations where monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers have insured all or some of the securities issued, by the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor. In the case of loans sold to parties other than the GSEs or GNMA, the contractual liability to repurchase typically arises only if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor, or investors, in the loan, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). Contracts with the GSEs do not contain equivalent language, while GNMA generally limits repurchases to loans that are not insured or guaranteed as required. 
  For additional information about accounting for representations and warranties and our representations and warranties claims and exposures, see Recent Events   Private-label Securitization Settlement with the Bank of New York Mellon,   Complex Accounting Estimates   Representations and Warranties  ,   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees   and   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   and   Item 1A. Risk Factors  . 
  Representations and Warranties Bulk Settlement Actions 
  Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, we have settled, or entered into agreements to settle, certain bulk representations and warranties claims with a trustee for certain legacy Countrywide private-label securitization trusts (the BNY Mellon Settlement), a monoline insurer (the Assured Guaranty Settlement) and with each  

Table of Contents  

     of the GSEs (the GSE Agreements). We have vigorously contested any request for repurchase when we conclude that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, we have reached bulk settlements, or agreements for bulk settlements, including settlement amounts which have been material, with the above-referenced counterparties in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process. We may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms we believe to be advantageous. For a summary of the larger bulk settlement actions we have taken beginning in 2010 and the related impact on the representations and warranties provision and liability, see   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . As indicated in   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees   and   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  , these bulk settlements generally do not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or all potential claims that may arise, including in some instances securities law, fraud and servicing claims, and our liability in connection with the transactions and claims not covered by these settlements could be material. 
  Recent Developments Related to the BNY Mellon Settlement 
  Under an order entered by the court in connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, potentially interested persons had the opportunity to give notice of intent to object to the settlement (including on the basis that more information was needed) until August 30, 2011. Approximately   44   groups or entities appeared prior to the deadline;   two   of those groups or entities have subsequently withdrawn from the proceeding and one motion to intervene was denied. Certain of these groups or entities filed notices of intent to object, made motions to intervene, or both filed notices of intent to object and made motions to intervene. The parties filing motions to intervene include the Attorneys General of the states of New York and Delaware, whose motions to intervene were granted. Parties who filed notices stating that they wished to obtain more information about the settlement include the FDIC and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We are not a party to the proceeding.  
  Certain of the motions to intervene and/or notices of intent to object allege various purported bases for opposition to the settlement, including challenges to the nature of the court proceeding and the lack of an opt-out mechanism, alleged conflicts of interest on the part of the institutional investor group and/or the Trustee, the inadequacy of the settlement amount and the method of allocating the settlement amount among the Covered Trusts, while other motions do not make substantive objections but state that they need more information about the settlement. An investor opposed to the settlement removed the proceeding to federal court. On   October 19, 2011  , the federal court denied BNY Mellon s motion to remand the proceeding to state court. BNY Mellon, as well as the investors that have intervened in support of the BNY Mellon Settlement, petitioned to appeal the denial of this motion. On November 4, 2011, the district court entered a written order setting a discovery schedule, and discovery is ongoing. On   December 27, 2011  , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted the appeal, and stated in an amended scheduling order that, pursuant to statute, it would rule on the appeal by   February 27, 2012  . 

It is not currently possible to predict how many of the parties who have appeared in the court proceeding will ultimately object to the BNY Mellon Settlement, whether the objections will prevent receipt of final court approval or the ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. In particular, conduct of discovery and the resolution of the objections to the settlement and any appeals could take a substantial period of time and these factors could materially delay the timing of final court approval. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict when the court approval process will be completed. 
  If final court approval is not obtained by   December 31, 2015  , we and legacy Countrywide may withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement, if the Trustee consents. The BNY Mellon Settlement also provides that if Covered Trusts representing unpaid principal balance exceeding a specified amount are excluded from the final BNY Mellon Settlement, based on investor objections or otherwise, we and legacy Countrywide have the option to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement pursuant to the terms of the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement. 
  There can be no assurance that final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement will be obtained, that all conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied or, if certain conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, that we and legacy Countrywide will not determine to withdraw from the settlement. If final court approval is not obtained or if we and legacy Countrywide determine to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, our future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different than existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals described under   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises   on page   61  . For more information about the risks associated with the BNY Mellon Settlement, see   Item 1A. Risk Factors  . 
  Unresolved Claims Status 
  At   December 31, 2011  , our total unresolved repurchase claims were approximately   $14.3 billion   compared to   $10.7 billion   at   December 31, 2010  . These repurchase claims include   $1.7 billion   in demands from investors in the Covered Trusts received in 2010 but otherwise do not include any repurchase claims related to the Covered Trusts. During   2011  , we received   $17.5 billion   in new repurchase claims, including   $14.3 billion   in new repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs for both legacy Countrywide originations not covered by the GSE Agreements and legacy Bank of America originations, and   $3.2 billion   in repurchase claims related to non-GSE transactions. During 2011,   $14.1 billion   in claims were resolved primarily with the GSEs and through the Assured Guaranty Settlement. Of the claims resolved,   $7.5 billion   were resolved through rescissions and   $6.6 billion   were resolved through mortgage repurchase and make-whole payments. The GSEs  repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with the GSEs  own past conduct and our interpretation of contractual liabilities. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. Claims outstanding from the monolines declined as a result of the Assured Guaranty Settlement, and new claims from other monolines declined significantly during 2011, which we believe was due in part to the monolines focusing recent efforts towards litigation. Outstanding claims from whole loan, private-label  

Table of Contents  

     securitization and other investors increased during 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in repurchase claims received from trustees in non-GSE transactions. Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase claims from the FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed securities is not significant because the requests are limited in number and are typically resolved quickly. For additional information concerning FHA-insured loans, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Other Mortgage-related Matters   on page   63  . 
  In addition to repurchase claims, we receive notices from mortgage insurance companies of claim denials, cancellations or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices) and the amount of such notices have remained elevated. When there is disagreement with the mortgage insurer as to the resolution of a MI rescission notice, meaningful dialogue and negotiation are generally necessary between the parties to reach a conclusion on an individual notice. The level of engagement of the mortgage insurance companies varies and on-going litigation involving some of the mortgage insurance companies over individual and bulk rescissions or claims for rescission limits our ability to engage in constructive dialogue leading to resolution. 
  For loans sold to GSEs or private-label securitization trusts (including those wrapped by the monoline bond insurers), a MI rescission may give rise to a claim for breach of the applicable representations and warranties, depending on the governing sale contracts. In those cases where the governing contracts contain a MI-related representation and warranty which upon rescission requires us to repurchase the affected loan or indemnify the investor for the related loss, we realize the loss without the benefit of MI. If we are required to repurchase a loan or indemnify the investor as a result of a different breach of representations and warranties and there has been a MI rescission, or if we hold the loan for investment, we realize the loss without the benefit of MI. In addition, mortgage insurance companies have in some cases asserted the ability to curtail MI payments, which in these cases would reduce the MI proceeds available to reduce such loss on the loan. While a legitimate MI rescission may constitute a valid basis for repurchase or other remedies under the GSE agreements and a small number of private-label MBS securitizations, and a MI rescission notice may result in a repurchase request, we believe MI rescission notices in and of themselves are not valid repurchase requests. 
  At   December 31, 2011  , we had approximately   90,000   open MI rescission notices compared to   72,000   at   December 31, 2010  . Through   December 31, 2011  ,   26 percent   of the MI rescission notices received have been resolved. Of those resolved,   24 percent   were resolved through our acceptance of the MI rescission,   46 percent   were resolved through reinstatement of coverage or payment of the claim by the mortgage insurance company, and   30 percent   were resolved on an aggregate basis through settlement, policy commutation or similar arrangement. As of   December 31, 2011  ,   74 percent   of the MI rescission notices we have received have not yet been resolved. Of those not yet resolved,   48 percent   are implicated by ongoing litigation where no loan-level review is currently contemplated (nor required to preserve our legal rights). In this litigation, the litigating mortgage insurance companies are also seeking bulk rescission of certain policies, separate and apart from loan-by-loan denials or rescissions. We are in the process of reviewing   11 percent   of the remaining open MI rescission notices, and we have reviewed and are contesting the MI rescission with respect to   89 percent   of these remaining open MI rescission notices. Of the remaining open MI rescission notices,   29 percent    

are also the subject of ongoing litigation although, at present, these MI rescissions are being processed in a manner generally consistent with those not affected by litigation.

  The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income (loss). The methodology used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors, which include depending on the counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that a repurchase claim will be received, consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased as well as other relevant facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements and identity of the counterparty or type of counterparty, as we believe appropriate. In the case of private-label securitizations, our estimate considers implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, adjusted to reflect differences between the Covered Trusts and the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be met. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change.  
  At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the liability was   $15.9 billion   and   $5.4 billion  . For   2011  , the provision for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees was   $15.6 billion   compared to   $6.8 billion   in   2010  . Of the   $15.6 billion   provision recorded in   2011  ,   $8.6 billion   was attributable to the BNY Mellon Settlement and   $7.0 billion   was related to other exposures. The BNY Mellon Settlement led to the determination that we had sufficient experience to record a liability related to our exposure on certain other private-label securitizations. This determination combined with higher estimated GSE repurchase rates were the primary drivers of the balance of the provision in   2011  . GSE repurchase rates increased driven by higher than expected claims during   2011  , including claims on loans that defaulted more than   18   months prior to the repurchase request and on loans where the borrower has made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least   25   payments), in each case in numbers that were not expected based on historical claims. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of the liability and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for any particular period. 
  Estimated Range of Possible Loss 
  Government-sponsored Enterprises 
  Our estimated liability as of   December 31, 2011   for obligations under representations and warranties with respect to GSE exposures is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, our historical claims experience with the GSEs. It includes our understanding of our agreements with the GSEs and projections of future defaults as well as certain other assumptions, and judgmental factors. Accordingly, future provisions associated with obligations under representations and warranties made to the  

Table of Contents  

     GSEs may be materially impacted if actual experiences are different from our assumptions. The GSEs  repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests, and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with the GSE s own past conduct and the Corporation s interpretation of its contractual obligations. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. We intend to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern our relationships with the GSEs. While we are seeking to resolve our differences with the GSEs concerning each party s interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, whether we will be able to achieve a resolution of these differences on acceptable terms, and timing thereof, is subject to significant uncertainty. 
  We are not able to predict changes in the behavior of the GSEs based on our past experiences. Therefore, it is not possible to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to any such potential impact in excess of current accrued liabilities. See   Complex Accounting Estimates   Representations and Warranties   on page   125   for information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for obligations under representations and warranties. 
  Non-Government-sponsored Enterprises 
  The population of private-label securitizations included in the BNY Mellon Settlement encompasses almost all legacy Countrywide first-lien private-label securitizations including loans originated principally in the   2004   through   2008   vintages. For the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, we believe it is probable that other claimants in certain types of securitizations may come forward with claims that meet the requirements of the terms of the securitizations. We have seen an increased trend in requests for loan files from private-label securitization trustees and an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet the required standards. We believe that the provisions recorded in connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement and the additional non-GSE representations and warranties provisions recorded in   2011   have provided for a substantial portion of our non-GSE representations and warranties exposure. However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. In addition, we have not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential monoline exposures and certain potential whole loan and other private-label securitization exposures. We currently estimate that the range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of   December 31, 2011   could be up to   $5 billion   over existing accruals. The estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions, including those set forth below, that are subject to change. 
  The methodology used to estimate the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss considers a variety of factors including our experience related to actual defaults, projected future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Among the factors that impact the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss are: (1) contractual loss causation requirements, (2) the representations and warranties provided, and (3) the requirement to meet certain presentation  

thresholds. The first factor is based on our belief that a non-GSE contractual liability to repurchase a loan generally arises only if the counterparties prove there is a breach of representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all investors, or the monoline insurer (as applicable), in a securitization trust, and accordingly, we believe that the repurchase claimants must prove that the alleged representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss. The second factor is related to the fact that non-GSE securitizations include different types of representations and warranties than those provided to the GSEs. We believe the non-GSE securitizations  representations and warranties are less rigorous and actionable than the explicit provisions of the comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs. The third factor is related to the fact that certain presentation thresholds need to be met in order for any repurchase claim to be asserted on the initiative of investors under the non-GSE agreements. A securitization trustee may investigate or demand repurchase on its own action, and most agreements contain a threshold, for example   25   percent of the voting rights per trust, that allows investors to declare a servicing event of default under certain circumstances or to request certain action, such as requesting loan files, that the trustee may choose to accept and follow, exempt from liability, provided the trustee is acting in good faith. If there is an uncured servicing event of default, and the trustee fails to bring suit during a   60  -day period, then, under most agreements, investors may file suit. In addition to this, most agreements also allow investors to direct the securitization trustee to investigate loan files or demand the repurchase of loans, if security holders hold a specified percentage, for example   25   percent, of the voting rights of each tranche of the outstanding securities. Although we continue to believe that presentation thresholds are a factor in the determination of probable loss, given the BNY Mellon Settlement, the estimated range of possible loss assumes that the presentation threshold can be met for all of the non-GSE securitization transactions.  
  In addition, in the case of private-label securitizations, our estimate considers implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, adjusted to reflect differences between the Covered Trusts and the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied. For additional information about the methodology used to estimate the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss, see   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from our assumptions in our predictive models, including, without limitation, those regarding ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, and a variety of other judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and this estimated range of possible loss. For example, if courts were to disagree with our interpretation that the underlying agreements require a claimant to prove that the representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss, it could significantly impact this  

Table of Contents  

     estimated range of possible loss. Additionally, if recent court rulings related to monoline litigation, including one related to us, that have allowed sampling of loan files instead of requiring a loan-by-loan review to determine if a representations and warranties breach has occurred are followed generally by the courts, private-label securitization investors may view litigation as a more attractive alternative as compared to a loan-by-loan review. For additional information regarding these issues, see MBIA litigation in Litigation and Regulatory Matters in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . Finally, although we believe that the representations and warranties typically given in non-GSE transactions are less rigorous and actionable than those given in GSE transactions, we do not have significant loan-level experience in non-GSE transactions to measure the impact of these differences on the probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased. 
  The liability for obligations under representations and warranties with respect to GSE and non-GSE exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties exposures do not include any losses related to litigation matters disclosed in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  , nor do they include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs, assessments and compensatory fees or any possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations (except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon Settlement), potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against us, including claims related to loans insured by the FHA. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities law (except to the extent reflected in the aggregate range of possible loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ), fraud or other claims against us; however, such loss could be material. 

Government-sponsored Enterprises Experience 
  Our current repurchase claims experience with the GSEs is predominantly concentrated in the   2004   through   2008   origination vintages where we believe that our exposure to representations and warranties liability is most significant. Our repurchase claims experience related to loans originated prior to   2004   has not been significant and we believe that the changes made to our operations and underwriting policies have reduced our exposure related to loans originated after   2008  .  
  Bank of America and legacy Countrywide sold approximately   $1.1 trillion   of loans originated from   2004   through   2008   to the GSEs. As of   December 31, 2011  ,   11 percent   of the loans in these vintages have defaulted or are 180 days or more past due (severely delinquent). At least   25   payments have been made on approximately   65 percent   of severely delinquent or defaulted loans. Through   December 31, 2011  , we have received   $32.4 billion   in repurchase claims associated with these vintages, representing approximately   three percent   of the loans sold to the GSEs in these vintages. Including the agreement reached with FNMA on   December 31, 2010  , we have resolved   $25.7 billion   of these claims with a net loss experience of approximately   31 percent  . The claims resolved and the loss rate do not include   $839 million   in claims extinguished as a result of the agreement with FHLMC due to the global nature of the agreement and, specifically, the absence of a formal apportionment of the agreement amount between current and future claims. Our collateral loss severity rate on approved repurchases has averaged approximately   45 to 55   percent. 
  Table 11   highlights our experience with the GSEs related to loans originated from   2004   through   2008  . Outstanding GSE claims increased to $6.3 billion, primarily attributable to   $14.3 billion   in new repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs for both legacy Countrywide originations not covered by the GSE Agreements and legacy Bank of America originations. The high level of new claims was partially offset by the resolution of claims with the GSEs. 

Table of Contents  

     The GSEs  repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with their past conduct as well as our interpretation of our contractual obligations. Notably, in recent periods we have been experiencing elevated levels of new claims from the GSEs, including claims on loans on which borrowers have made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least   25   payments) or on loans which had defaulted more than 18 months prior to the repurchase request, in each case, in numbers that were not expected based on historical experience. Also, the criteria and the processes by which the GSEs are ultimately willing to resolve claims have changed in ways that are unfavorable to us. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. We intend to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern our relationships with the GSEs. While we are seeking to resolve our differences with the GSEs concerning each party s interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, whether we will be able to achieve a resolution of these differences on acceptable terms and timing thereof, is subject to significant uncertainty.  
  Beginning in February 2012, we are no longer delivering purchase money and non-MHA refinance first-lien residential mortgage products into FNMA MBS pools because of the expiration  and mutual non-renewal of certain contractual delivery commitments and variances that permit efficient delivery of such loans to FNMA. While we continue to have a valid agreement with FNMA permitting the delivery of purchase money and non-MHA refinance first-lien residential mortgage products without such contractual variances, the delivery of such products without contractual delivery commitments and variances would involve time and expense to implement the necessary operational and systems changes and otherwise present practical operational issues. The non-renewal of these variances was influenced, in part, by our ongoing differences with FNMA in other contexts, including repurchase claims. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our   CRES   business, as we expect to rely on other sources of liquidity to actively extend mortgage credit to our customers including continuing to deliver such products into FHLMC MBS pools. Additionally, we continue to deliver MHA refinancing products into FNMA MBS pools and continue to engage in dialogue to attempt to address these differences.  
  On June 30, 2011, FNMA issued an announcement requiring servicers to report, effective   October 1, 2011  , all MI rescission notices with respect to loans sold to FNMA. The announcement also confirmed FNMA s view of its position that a mortgage insurance company s issuance of a MI rescission notice constitutes a breach of the lender s representations and warranties and permits FNMA to require the lender to repurchase the mortgage loan or promptly remit a make-whole payment covering FNMA s loss even if the lender is contesting the MI rescission notice. A related announcement included a ban on bulk settlements with mortgage insurers that provide for loss sharing in lieu of rescission. According to FNMA s announcement, through   June 30, 2012  , lenders have 90 days to appeal FNMA s repurchase request and 30 days (or such other time frame specified by FNMA) to appeal after that date. According to FNMA s announcement, in order to be successful in its appeal, a lender must provide documentation confirming reinstatement or continuation of coverage. This announcement could result in more repurchase requests from FNMA than the assumptions in our estimated liability contemplate. We also expect that in many cases (particularly in the context of individual or bulk rescissions being  

contested through litigation), we will not be able to resolve MI rescission notices with the mortgage insurance companies before the expiration of the appeal period prescribed by the FNMA announcement. We have informed FNMA that we do not believe that the new policy is valid under our contracts with FNMA, and that we do not intend to repurchase loans under the terms set forth in the new policy. Our pipeline of outstanding repurchase claims from the GSEs resulting solely on MI rescission notices has increased during   2011   by   $935 million   to   $1.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011  . If we are required to abide by the terms of the new FNMA policy, our representations and warranties liability will likely increase. 
  Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises 
  In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. As detailed in   Table 12  , legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold loans originated from   2004   through   2008   with an original principal balance of   $963 billion   to investors other than GSEs (although the GSEs are investors in certain private-label securitizations), of which approximately   $506 billion   in principal has been paid and   $239 billion   has defaulted or are severely delinquent at   December 31, 2011  . 
  As it relates to private-label securitizations, a contractual liability to repurchase mortgage loans generally arises only if counterparties prove there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all investors in a securitization trust or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). We believe that the longer a loan performs, the less likely it is that an alleged representations and warranties breach had a material impact on the loan s performance or that a breach even exists. Because the majority of the borrowers in this population would have made a significant number of payments if they are not yet 180 days or more past due, we believe that the principal balance at the greatest risk for repurchase claims in this population of private-label securitization investors is a combination of loans that have already defaulted and those that are currently severely delinquent. Additionally, the obligation to repurchase loans also requires that counterparties have the contractual right to demand repurchase of the loans (presentation thresholds). While we believe the agreements for private-label securitizations generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties and place higher burdens on investors seeking repurchases than the explicit provisions of the comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs, the agreements generally include a representation that underwriting practices were prudent and customary. 
  Any amounts paid related to repurchase claims from a monoline insurer are paid to the securitization trust and are applied in accordance with the terms of the governing securitization documents, which may include use by the securitization trust to repay any outstanding monoline advances or reduce future advances from the monolines. To the extent that a monoline has not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it will be required to advance funds to the securitization trust, the likelihood of receiving a repurchase claim from a monoline may be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no benefit from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some monolines are not currently  

Table of Contents  

     performing their obligations under the financial guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims, although in those circumstances, investors may be able to bring claims if contractual thresholds are met. 
  Table 12   details the population of loans originated between   2004   and   2008   and the population of loans sold as whole loans or in non-agency securitizations by entity and product together with the defaulted and severely delinquent loans stratified by the number of payments the borrower made prior to default or becoming severely delinquent at   December 31, 2011  . As shown in   Table 12  , at least   25   payments have been made on  

approximately   63 percent   of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. We believe many of the defaults observed in these securitizations have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high unemployment and other negative economic trends, diminishing the likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was the cause of a loan s default. As of   December 31, 2011  , approximately   25 percent   of the loans sold to non-GSEs that were originated between   2004   and   2008   have defaulted or are severely delinquent. Of the original principal balance for Countrywide,   $409 billion   is included in the BNY Mellon Settlement. 

(1)   
    Excludes transactions sponsored by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch where no representations or warranties were made. 
               (2)   
    Includes exposures on third-party sponsored transactions related to legacy entity originations. 
       Monoline Insurers 
  Legacy companies sold   $184.5 billion   of loans originated between   2004   and   2008   into monoline-insured securitizations, which are included in   Table 12  , including   $103.9 billion   of first-lien mortgages and   $80.6 billion   of home equity mortgages. Of these balances,   $45.9 billion   of the first-lien mortgages and   $50.4 billion   of the home equity mortgages have been paid in full and   $36.3 billion   of the first-lien mortgages and   $16.7 billion   of the home equity mortgages have defaulted or are severely delinquent at   December 31, 2011  . At least   25   payments have been made on approximately   60 percent   of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. Of the first-lien mortgages sold,   $39.1 billion  , or   38 percent  , were sold as whole loans to other institutions which subsequently included these loans with those of other originators in private-label securitization transactions in which the monolines typically insured one or more securities. Through   December 31, 2011  , we have received   $6.0 billion   of representations and warranties claims related to the monoline-insured transactions. Of these repurchase claims,   $2.0 billion   were resolved through the Assured Guaranty Settlement,   $813 million   were resolved through repurchase or indemnification with losses of   $703 million   and   $138 million   were rescinded by the investor or paid in full. The majority of these resolved claims related to home equity mortgages. Experience with most of the monoline insurers has varied in terms of process, and experience with these counterparties has not been predictable. 

At   December 31, 2011  , for loans originated between   2004   and   2008  , the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase claims was   $3.1 billion  , substantially all of which we have reviewed and declined to repurchase based on an assessment of whether a material breach exists. At   December 31, 2011  , the unpaid principal balance of loans in these vintages for which the monolines had requested loan files for review but for which no repurchase claim had been received was   $6.1 billion  , excluding loans that had been paid in full and file requests for loans included in the trusts settled with Assured Guaranty. There will likely be additional requests for loan files in the future leading to repurchase claims. 
  We have had limited experience with the monoline insurers, other than Assured Guaranty, in the repurchase process as each of these monoline insurers has instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and/or Bank of America, which limits our ability to enter into constructive dialogue with these monolines to resolve the open claims. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate probable future repurchase obligations with respect to those monolines with whom we have limited repurchase experience and, therefore, no representations and warranties liability has been recorded in connection with these monolines, other than a liability for repurchase claims where we have determined that there are valid loan defects. Our estimated range  

Table of Contents  

     of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of   December 31, 2011   included possible losses related to these monoline insurers. 
  Whole Loans and Private-label Securitizations 
  Legacy entities, and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold loans to investors as whole loans or via private-label securitizations. The majority of the loans sold were included in private-label securitizations, including third-party sponsored transactions. The loans sold with total principal balance of   $778.2 billion  , included in   Table 12  , were originated between   2004   and   2008  , of which   $409.4 billion   have been paid in full and   $186.1 billion   are defaulted or severely delinquent at   December 31, 2011  . In connection with these transactions, we provided representations and warranties, and the whole-loan investors may retain those rights even when the whole loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. At least   25   payments have been made on approximately   64 percent   of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. We have received approximately   $10.9 billion   of representations and warranties claims from whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors related to these vintages, including   $6.1 billion   from whole-loan investors,   $2.2 billion   from private-label securitization trustees,   $1.7 billion   in claims from private-label securitization investors in the Covered Trusts received in 2010, and   $819 million   from one private-label securitization counterparty which were submitted prior to 2008. In private-label securitizations, certain representation thresholds need to be met in order for any repurchase claim to be asserted by the investors. The majority of the claims that we have received outside of those from the GSEs and monolines are from third-party whole-loan investors. However, the amount of claims received from private-label securitization trustees that meet the required standards has been increasing. In   2011  , we received   $2.1 billion   of repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees. In addition, there has been an increase in requests for loan files from private-label securitization trustees, as well as requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statutes of limitation relating to representations and warranties claims, and we believe it is likely that these requests will lead to an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet the required standards. 
  We have resolved   $6.1 billion   of the claims received from whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors with losses of   $1.4 billion  . Approximately   $2.8 billion   of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification and   $3.3 billion   were rescinded by the investor. Claims outstanding related to these vintages totaled   $4.8 billion  , including   $2.8 billion   that have been reviewed where it is believed a valid defect has not been identified which would constitute an actionable breach of representations and warranties and   $2.0 billion   that are in the process of review. 
  Certain whole-loan investors have engaged with us in a consistent repurchase process and we have used that experience to record a liability related to existing and future claims from such counterparties. The BNY Mellon Settlement led to the determination in the second quarter of 2011 that we had sufficient experience to record a liability related to our exposure on certain other private-label securitizations. However, the BNY Mellon Settlement did not provide sufficient experience related to certain private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors. As it relates to certain private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors and certain other  

whole loan sales, it is not possible to determine whether a loss has occurred or is probable and, therefore, no representations and warranties liability has been recorded in connection with these transactions. Our estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of   December 31, 2011   included possible losses related to these whole loan sales and private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors. 
  Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files. The inclusion of the   $1.7 billion   in outstanding claims noted on page   63   does not mean that we believe these claims have satisfied the contractual thresholds required for these investors to direct the securitization trustee to take action or that these claims are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid. One of these claimants has filed litigation against us relating to certain of these claims; the claims in this litigation would be extinguished if there is final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement. Additionally, certain private-label securitizations are insured by the monoline insurers, which are not reflected in these amounts regarding whole loan sales and private-label securitizations. 
  Other Mortgage-related Matters 
  Servicing Matters and Foreclosure Processes 
  We service a large portion of the loans we or our subsidiaries have securitized and also service loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each GSE typically claims the right to demand that the servicer repurchase loans that breach the seller s representations and warranties made in connection with the initial sale of the loans even if the servicer was not the seller. The GSEs also claim that they have the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches. In addition, the GSEs  first mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary, and purport to require the imposition of compensatory fees if those deadlines are not satisfied except for reasons beyond the control of the servicer, although we believe that the governing contracts, our course of dealing, and collective past practices and understandings should inform resolution of these matters. In addition, many non-agency RMBS and whole-loan servicing agreements require the servicer to indemnify the trustee or other investor for or against failures by the servicer to perform its servicing obligations or acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the servicer s duties. It is not possible to reasonably estimate our liability with respect to potential servicing-related claims. While we have recorded certain accruals for servicing-related claims, the amount of potential liability in excess of existing accruals could be material. 
  In October 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in states where foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states) and stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an assessment of related business processes. We have resumed foreclosure sales in nearly all non-judicial states. While we have resumed foreclosure proceedings in nearly all judicial states, our progress on foreclosure sales in judicial states  

Table of Contents  

     has been much slower than in non-judicial states. The pace of foreclosure sales in judicial states increased significantly by the fourth quarter of 2011. However, there continues to be a backlog of foreclosure inventory in judicial states. The implementation of changes in procedures and controls, including loss mitigation procedures related to our ability to recover on FHA-insurance related claims, and governmental, regulatory and judicial actions, may result in continuing delays in foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales, and create obstacles to the collection of certain fees and expenses, in both judicial and non-judicial foreclosures.  
  We entered into a consent order with the Federal Reserve and BANA entered into a consent order with the OCC on April 13, 2011. These consent orders require servicers to make several enhancements to their servicing operations, including implementation of a single point of contact model for borrowers throughout the loss mitigation and foreclosure processes, adoption of measures designed to ensure that foreclosure activity is halted once a borrower has been approved for a modification unless the borrower fails to make payments under the modified loan and implementation of enhanced controls over third-party vendors that provide default servicing support services. In addition, the OCC consent order required that we retain an independent consultant, approved by the OCC, to conduct a review of all foreclosure actions pending, or foreclosure sales that occurred, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010 and submit a plan to the OCC to remediate all financial injury to borrowers caused by any deficiencies identified through the review. The review is comprised of two parts: a sample file review conducted by the independent consultant, which began in October 2011, and file reviews by the independent consultant based upon requests for review from customers with in-scope foreclosures. We began outreach to those customers in November 2011, and additional outreach efforts are underway. Because the review process is available to a large number of potentially eligible borrowers and involves an examination of many details and documents, each review could take several months to complete. We cannot yet accurately determine how many borrowers will ultimately request a review, how many borrowers will meet the eligibility requirements or how much in compensation might ultimately be paid to eligible borrowers. 
  We continue to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current servicing and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the Servicing Resolution Agreements, defined below. This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny may subject us to inquiries or investigations that could significantly adversely affect our reputation and result in material costs to us. 
  Servicing Resolution Agreements 
  On   February 9, 2012  , we reached agreements in principle (collectively, the Servicing Resolution Agreements) with (1) the DOJ, various federal regulatory agencies and   49   state attorneys general to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination, servicing and foreclosure practices (the Global AIP), (2) the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA) to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily by Countrywide prior to and for a period following our acquisition of that lender (the FHA AIP) and (3) each of the Federal  

Reserve and the OCC regarding civil monetary penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011 (the Consent Order AIPs). The Servicing Resolution Agreements are subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and completion and execution of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. There can be no assurance as to when or whether binding settlement agreements will be reached, that they will be on terms consistent with the Servicing Resolution Agreements, or as to when or whether the necessary approvals will be obtained and the settlements will be finalized. 
  The Global AIP calls for the establishment of certain uniform servicing standards, upfront cash payments of approximately   $1.9 billion   to the state and federal governments and for borrower restitution, approximately   $7.6 billion   in borrower assistance in the form of, among other things, principal reduction, short sales, deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and approximately   $1.0 billion   in refinancing assistance. We could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet our borrower assistance and refinancing assistance commitments over a three-year period. In addition, we could be required to pay an additional   $350 million   if we fail to meet certain first-lien principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period. We also entered into agreements with several states under which we committed to perform certain minimum levels of principal reduction and related activities within those states as part of the Global AIP, and under which we could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet such minimum levels.  
  The FHA AIP provides for an upfront cash payment of   $500 million   and the FHA would release us from all claims arising from loans originated on or before April 30, 2009 that were submitted for FHA insurance claim payments prior to January 1, 2012, and from multiple damages and penalties for loans that were originated on or before April 30, 2009, but had not been submitted for FHA insurance claim payment. An additional   $500 million   would be payable if we fail to meet certain principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period.  
  Pursuant to an agreement in principle, the OCC agreed to hold in abeyance the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of   $164 million  . Pursuant to a separate agreement in principle, the Federal Reserve will assess a civil monetary penalty in the amount of   $176 million   against us. Satisfying our payment, borrower assistance and remediation obligations under the Global AIP will satisfy any civil monetary penalty obligations arising under these agreements in principle. If, however, we do not make certain required payments or undertake certain required actions under the Global AIP, the OCC will assess, and the Federal Reserve will require us to pay, the difference between the aggregate value of the payments and actions under these agreements in principle and the penalty amounts. 
  Under the terms of the Global AIP, the federal and participating state governments would release us from further liability for certain alleged residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure deficiencies. In settling origination issues related to FHA guaranteed loans originated on or before April 30, 2009, the FHA would provide us and our affiliates a release for all claims with respect to such loans if an insurance claim had been submitted to the FHA prior to January 1, 2012 and a release of multiple damages and penalties (but not single damages) if no such claim had been submitted.  
  The financial impact of the Servicing Resolution Agreements is not expected to require any additional reserves over existing accruals as of December 31, 2011, based on our understanding  

Table of Contents  

     of the terms of the Servicing Resolution Agreements. The refinancing assistance commitment under the Servicing Resolution Agreements is expected to be recognized as lower interest income in future periods as qualified borrowers pay reduced interest rates on loans refinanced. Although we may incur additional operating costs (e.g., servicing costs) to implement parts of the Servicing Resolution Agreements in future periods, it is expected that those costs will not be material.  
  The Servicing Resolution Agreements do not cover claims arising out of securitization (including representations made to investors respecting MBS), criminal claims, private claims by borrowers, claims by certain states for injunctive relief or actual economic damages to borrowers related to the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), and claims by the GSEs (including repurchase demands), among other items. Failure to finalize the documentation related to the Servicing Resolution Agreements, to obtain the required court and regulatory approvals, to meet our borrower and refinancing commitments or other adverse developments with respect to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. 
  Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce mortgage loans. There has been significant public commentary regarding the common industry practice of recording mortgages in the name of MERS, as nominee on behalf of the note holder, and whether securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens securing those loans. We currently use the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been sold to investors or securitization trusts. A component of the OCC consent order requires significant changes in the manner in which we service loans identifying MERS as the mortgagee. Additionally, certain local and state governments have commenced legal actions against us, MERS, and other MERS members, questioning the validity of the MERS model. Other challenges have also been made to the process for transferring mortgage loans to securitization trusts, asserting that having a mortgagee of record that is different than the holder of the mortgage note could  break the chain of title  and cloud the ownership of the loan. In order to foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it may be necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to be made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a mortgage held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be completed by a MERS signing officer. As such, our practice is to obtain assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to instituting foreclosure. If certain required documents are missing or defective, or if the use of MERS is found not to be valid, we could be obligated to cure certain defects or in some circumstances be subject to additional costs and expenses. Our use of MERS as nominee for the mortgage may also create reputational risks for us. 
  Impact of Foreclosure Delays 
  In   2011  , we incurred   $1.8 billion   of mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs which included   $1.3 billion   for compensatory fees that we expect to be claimed by the GSEs as a result of foreclosure delays with the remainder being out-of-pocket costs that we do not expect to recover because of foreclosure delays. We expect that mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs,  

compensatory fees assessed by the GSEs and other costs associated with foreclosures will remain elevated as additional loans are delayed in the foreclosure process, although we believe that the governing contracts, our course of dealing, and collective past practices and understandings should inform resolution of these matters. We also expect additional costs related to resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment and to implement other operational changes will continue. This will likely result in continued higher noninterest expense, including higher default servicing costs and legal expenses in   CRES  , and has impacted and may continue to impact the value of our MSRs related to these serviced loans. It is also possible that the delays in foreclosure sales may result in additional costs and expenses, including costs associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home price declines while foreclosures are delayed. In addition, required process changes, including those required under the consent orders with federal bank regulators, are likely to result in further increases in our default servicing costs over the longer term. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales may continue to be protracted, which may result in a greater number of nonperforming loans and increased servicing advances and may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our MSR asset, MBS and real estate owned properties. 
  An increase in the time to complete foreclosure sales also may increase the number of severely delinquent loans in our mortgage servicing portfolio, result in increasing levels of consumer nonperforming loans and could have a dampening effect on net interest margin as nonperforming assets increase. Accordingly, delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated, our continued process enhancements, including those required under the OCC and Federal Reserve consent orders and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure process could significantly increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. 
  Mortgage-related Settlements   Servicing Matters   
  In connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain servicing changes. The Trustee and BANA have agreed to clarify and conform certain servicing standards related to loss mitigation. In particular, the BNY Mellon Settlement would clarify that it is permissible to apply the same loss-mitigation strategies to the Covered Trusts as are applied to BANA affiliates  held-for-investment (HFI) portfolios. This portion of the agreement was effective in the second quarter of 2011 and is not conditioned on final court approval. 
  BANA also agreed to transfer the servicing related to certain high-risk loans to qualified subservicers on a schedule that began with the signing of the BNY Mellon Settlement. This servicing transfer protocol will reduce the servicing fees payable to BANA in the future. Upon final court approval, failure to meet the established benchmarking standards for loans not in subservicing arrangements can trigger the payment of agreed-upon fees. Additionally, we and legacy Countrywide have agreed to work to resolve with the Trustee certain mortgage documentation issues related to the enforceability of mortgages in foreclosure and to reimburse the related Covered Trust for any loss if BANA is unable to foreclose on the mortgage and the Covered Trust is not made whole by a title policy because of these documentation issues. These agreements will terminate if final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement is not obtained, although we could still have exposure under the pooling and servicing agreements related to  

Table of Contents  

     the mortgages in the Covered Trusts for these documentation issues. 
  We estimate that the costs associated with additional servicing obligations under the BNY Mellon Settlement contributed   $400 million   to the 2011 valuation charge related to the MSR asset. The additional servicing actions are consistent with the consent orders with the OCC and the Federal Reserve. 
  In addition, in connection with the Servicing Resolution Agreements, BANA has agreed to implement certain additional servicing changes. The uniform servicing standards established under the Servicing Resolution Agreements are broadly consistent with the residential mortgage servicing practices imposed by the OCC consent order, however they are more prescriptive and cover a broader range of our residential mortgage servicing activities. These standards are intended to strengthen procedural safeguards and documentation requirements associated with foreclosure, bankruptcy, and loss mitigation activities, as well as addressing the imposition of fees and the integrity of documentation, with a goal of ensuring greater transparency for borrowers. These uniform servicing standards also obligate us to implement compliance processes reasonably designed to provide assurance of the achievement of these objectives. Compliance with the uniform servicing standards will be assessed by a monitor based on the measurement of outcomes with respect to these objectives. Implementation of these uniform servicing standards is expected to incrementally increase costs associated with the servicing process, but is not expected to result in material delays or dislocation in the performance of our mortgage servicing obligations, including the completion of foreclosures. 
    Regulatory Matters 
  See Item 1A. Risk Factors and   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information regarding regulatory matters and risks.  
  Financial Reform Act 
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, enacts sweeping financial regulatory reform and has altered and will continue to alter the way in which we conduct certain businesses, increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Many aspects of the Financial Reform Act remain subject to final rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the precise impact on the Corporation, our customers or the financial services industry.  
  Debit Interchange Fees 
  On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule with respect to the Durbin Amendment effective on October 1, 2011 which, among other things, established a regulatory cap for many types of debit interchange transactions to equal no more than 21 cents plus five bps of the value of the transaction. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements, with which we are currently in compliance. The Federal Reserve also approved rules governing routing and exclusivity, requiring issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product, which are effective April 1, 2012. For additional information, see   Card Services     on page   41  . 

Limitations on Proprietary Trading 
  On October 11, 2011, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), representing four of the five regulatory agencies charged with promulgating regulations implementing limitations on proprietary trading as well as the sponsorship of or investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (the Volcker Rule) established by the Financial Reform Act, released for comment proposed implementing regulations. On January 11, 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the fifth agency, released for comment its proposed regulations under the Volcker Rule. The proposed regulations include clarifications to the definition of proprietary trading and distinctions between permitted and prohibited activities. However, in light of the complexity of the proposed regulations and the large volume of comments received (the proposal requested comments on over 1,300 questions on 400 different topics), it is not possible to predict the content of the final regulations or when they will be issued.  
  The statutory provisions of the Volcker Rule will become effective on July 21, 2012, whether or not the final regulations are adopted, and it gives certain financial institutions two years from the effective date, with opportunities for additional extensions, to bring activities and investments into compliance. Although   GBAM e  xited its stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011 in anticipation of the Volcker Rule and further to our initiative to optimize our balance sheet, the ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule on us remains uncertain. However, based upon the content of the proposed regulations, it is possible that the implementation of the Volcker Rule could limit or restrict our remaining trading activities. Implementation of the Volcker Rule could also limit or restrict our ability to sponsor and hold ownership interests in hedge funds, private equity funds and other subsidiary operations, increase our operational and compliance costs, reduce our trading revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. For additional information about our trading business, see   GBAM   on page   49  . 
  Derivatives 
  The Financial Reform Act includes measures to broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives; imposing new capital, margin, reporting, registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants; and imposing position limits on certain OTC derivatives. The Financial Reform Act required regulators to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to implement these regulations by July 16, 2011. However, the rulemaking process was not completed as of this date, and is not expected to conclude until well into 2012. Further, the regulators granted temporary relief from certain requirements that would have taken effect on July 16, 2011 absent any rulemaking. The SEC temporary relief is effective until final rules relevant to each requirement become effective. The CFTC temporary relief is effective until the earlier of July 16, 2012 or the date on which final rules relevant to each requirement become effective. The ultimate impact of these derivatives regulations and the time it will take to comply continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose additional operational and compliance costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses, thereby negatively impacting our revenues and results of operations  .

     FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments 
  In April 2011, a new regulation became effective that implements revisions to the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act and increased our FDIC exposure. The regulation was reflected in the June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and in payments made beginning on September 30, 2011. Among other things, the regulation changed the assessment base for insured depository institutions from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets during an assessment period, less average tangible equity capital during that assessment period. Additionally, the FDIC has broad discretionary authority to increase assessments on large and highly complex institutions on a case by case basis. Any future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other bank industry fees could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Recovery and Resolution Planning 
  On October 17, 2011, the Federal Reserve approved a rule that requires the Corporation and other bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, as well as companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to periodically report to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve their plans for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.  
  On January 17, 2012, the FDIC approved a final rule requiring resolution plans for insured banks with total assets of $50 billion or more. If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve determine that a company s plan is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, then the FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose on the company, or any of its subsidiaries, more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations. The Corporation s initial plan is required to be submitted on or before July 1, 2012, and updated annually. Similarly, in the U.K., the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued proposed rules requiring the submission of significant information about certain U.K. incorporated subsidiaries, including information on intra-group dependencies and legal entity separation, to allow the FSA to develop resolution plans. As a result of the FSA review, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years which could impose operational costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain business and subsidiaries.  
  Orderly Liquidation Authority 
  Under the Financial Reform Act, where a systemically important financial institution such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may, in certain circumstances, be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such systemically important financial institution. In such a case, the FDIC could invoke a new form of resolution authority, called the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
  The orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Macroprudential systemic protection is the primary objective of the orderly liquidation authority, subject to minimum threshold protections for creditors. Accordingly, in certain circumstances under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC could permit payment of obligations determined  

to be systemically significant (e.g., short-term creditors or operating creditors) in lieu of the payment of other obligations (e.g., long-term creditors) without the need to obtain creditors  consent or prior court review. Additionally, under the orderly liquidation authority, amounts owed to the U.S. government generally enjoy a statutory payment priority. 
  Credit Risk Retention 
  On March 29, 2011, federal regulators jointly issued a proposed rule regarding credit risk retention that would, among other things, require retention by sponsors of at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets underlying certain ABS and MBS securitizations and would limit the ability to transfer or hedge that credit risk. The proposed rule as currently written would likely have an adverse impact on our ability to engage in many types of the MBS and ABS securitizations conducted in   CRES  ,   GBAM   and other business segments, impose additional operational and compliance costs on us, and negatively influence the value, liquidity and transferability of ABS or MBS, loans and other assets. However, it remains unclear what requirements will be included in the final rule and what the ultimate impact of the final rule will be on our   CRES  ,   GBAM   and other business segments or on our results of operations. 
  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
  The Financial Reform Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under federal consumer financial laws. In addition, the CFPB was granted general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, on July 21, 2011, certain federal consumer financial protection statutes and related regulatory authority were transferred to the CFPB. Consequently, certain federal consumer financial laws to which the Corporation is subject, including, but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Electronic Fund Transfers Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Truth in Lending and Truth in Savings Acts will be enforced by the CFPB, subject to certain statutory limitations. On January 4, 2012, the CFPB s first director was appointed, and accordingly, was vested with full authority to exercise all supervisory, enforcement and rulemaking authorities granted to the CFPB under the Financial Reform Act, including its supervisory powers over non-bank financial institutions such as pay-day lenders and other types of non-bank financial institutions. 
  Certain Other Provisions 
  The Financial Reform Act also expands the role of state regulators in enforcing consumer protection requirements over banks and disqualifies trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital. Many of the provisions under the Financial Reform Act have begun to be phased in or will be phased in over the next several months or years and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. For additional information regarding regulatory capital and other rules proposed by federal regulators, see   Capital Management   Regulatory Capital Changes   on page   73  .  

Table of Contents  

     The Financial Reform Act will continue to have a significant and negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and new restrictions, as well as reductions to available capital. The Financial Reform Act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. The ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act on our businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain provisions. For information on the impact of the Financial Reform Act on our credit ratings, see   Liquidity Risk   on page   76  . 
  Transactions with Affiliates 
  The terms of certain of our OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements of the Corporation provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change in our credit ratings, Merrill Lynch and other non-bank affiliates may be required to provide additional collateral or to provide other remedies, or our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements. Following the recent downgrade of the credit ratings of the Corporation and other non-bank affiliates, we have engaged in discussions with certain derivative and other counterparties regarding their rights under these agreements. In response to counterparties  inquiries and requests, we have discussed and in some cases substituted derivative contracts and other trading agreements, including naming BANA as the new counterparty. Our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements to meet counterparties  requests may be subject to certain limitations, including counterparty willingness, regulatory limitations on naming BANA as the new counterparty, and the type or amount of collateral required. It is possible that such limitations on our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements, including naming BANA as the new counterparty, could adversely affect our results of operations.  
  Other Matters 
  The Corporation has established guidelines and policies for managing capital across its subsidiaries. The guidance for the Corporation s subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements, including branch operations of banking subsidiaries, requires each entity to maintain satisfactory capital levels. This includes setting internal capital targets for the U.S. bank subsidiaries to exceed  well capitalized  levels. The U.K. has adopted increased capital and liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. has proposed the creation and production of recovery and resolution plans, commonly referred to as living wills, by such entities. We are currently monitoring the impact of these initiatives. 
    Managing Risk 
  Overview 
  Risk is inherent in every material business activity that we undertake. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risk. We must manage these risks to maximize our long-term results by ensuring  

the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. 
  Strategic risk is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution, and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower s or counterparty s inability to meet its obligations. Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. Liquidity risk is the inability to meet contractual and contingent financial obligations, on-or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Compliance risk is the risk that arises from the failure to adhere to laws, rules, regulations, or internal policies and procedures. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events. Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding an organization s conduct or business practices will adversely affect its profitability, operations or customer base, or result in costly litigation or require other measures. Reputational risk is evaluated along with all of the risk categories and throughout the risk management process, and as such is not discussed separately herein. The following sections,   Strategic Risk Management   on page   71  ,   Capital Management   on page   71  ,   Liquidity Risk   on page   76  ,   Credit Risk Management   on page   80  ,   Market Risk Management   on page   112  ,   Compliance Risk Management   and   Operational Risk Management   both on page   119  , address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage. 
  In choosing when and how to take risks, we evaluate our capacity for risk and seek to protect our brand and reputation, our financial flexibility, the value of our assets and the strategic potential of the Corporation. We intend to maintain a strong and flexible financial position. We also intend to focus on maintaining our relevance and value to customers, employees and shareholders. As part of our efforts to achieve these objectives, we continue to build a comprehensive risk management culture and to implement governance and control measures to strengthen that culture. 
  We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. We have a defined risk framework and clearly articulated risk appetite which is approved annually by the Corporation s Board of Directors (the Board). Risk management planning is integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole as well as managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions, and across all geographic locations. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities. 
  Executive management assesses, and the Board oversees, the risk-adjusted returns of each business segment. Management reviews and approves strategic and financial operating plans, and recommends to the Board for approval a financial plan annually. By allocating economic capital to and establishing a risk appetite for a business segment, we seek to effectively manage the ability to take on risk. Economic capital is assigned to each business segment using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment s stand-alone credit, market, interest rate and operational  

Table of Contents  

     risk     components, and is used to measure risk-adjusted returns. 
  In addition to reputational considerations, businesses operate within their credit, market, compliance and operational risk standards and limits in order to adhere to the risk appetite. These limits are based on analyses of risk and reward in each business, and executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board monitors financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite and the adequacy of internal controls through its committees. 
  The Board has completed its review of the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite Statement for the Corporation, and both the Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement were approved in January 2012. The Risk Framework defines the accountability of the Corporation and its employees and the Risk Appetite Statement defines the parameters under which we will take risk. Both documents are intended to enable us to maximize our long-term results and ensure the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. The Risk Framework is designed to be used by our employees to understand risk management activities, including their individual roles and accountabilities. It also defines how risk management is integrated into our core business processes, and it defines the risk management governance structure, including management s involvement. The risk management responsibilities of the businesses, governance and control functions, and Corporate Audit are also clearly defined. The risk management process includes four critical elements: identify and measure risk, mitigate and control risk, monitor and test risk, and report and review risk, and is applied across all business activities to enable an integrated and comprehensive review of risk consistent with the Board s Risk Appetite Statement. 
  Risk Management Processes and Methods 
  To support our corporate goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies, we maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, by management and the Board. All employees have accountability for risk management. Each employee s risk management responsibilities falls into one of three major categories: businesses, governance and control, and Corporate Audit. 
  Business managers and employees are accountable for identifying, managing and escalating attention to all risks in their business units, including existing and emerging risks. Business managers must ensure that their business activities are conducted within the risk appetite defined by management and approved by the Board. The limits and controls for each business must be consistent with the Risk Appetite Statement. Employees in client and customer facing businesses are responsible for day-to-day business activities, including developing and delivering profitable products and services, fulfilling customer requests and maintaining desirable customer relationships. These employees are accountable for conducting their daily work in accordance with policies and procedures. It is the responsibility of each employee to protect the Corporation and defend the interests of the shareholders. 
  Governance and control functions are comprised of Global Risk Management, Global Compliance, Legal and the enterprise control functions and are tasked with independently overseeing and managing risk activities. Global Compliance (which included  

Regulatory Relations) and Legal report to the Chief Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Relations Executive. Enterprise control functions consist of the Chief Financial Officer Group, Global Technology and Operations, Global Human Resources, Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs.  
  Global Risk Management is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The CRO leads senior management in managing risk, is independent from the Corporation s business and enterprise control functions, and maintains sufficient autonomy to develop and implement meaningful risk management measures. This position serves to protect the Corporation and its shareholders. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and is the management team lead or a participant in Board-level risk governance committees. The CRO has the mandate to ensure that appropriate risk management practices are in place, and are effective and consistent with our overall business strategy and risk appetite. Global Risk Management is comprised of two types of risk teams, Enterprise risk teams and independent business risk teams, which report to the CRO and are independent from the business and enterprise control functions. 
  Enterprise risk teams are responsible for setting and establishing enterprise policies, programs and standards, assessing program adherence, providing enterprise-level risk oversight, and reporting and monitoring for systemic and emerging risk issues. In addition, the Enterprise Risk Teams are responsible for monitoring and ensuring that risk limits are reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. These risk teams also carry out risk-based oversight of the enterprise control functions. 
  Independent business risk teams are responsible for establishing policies, limits, standards, controls, metrics and thresholds within the defined corporate standards for the businesses to which they are aligned. The independent business risk teams are also responsible for ensuring that risk limits and standards are reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. 
  Enterprise control functions are independent of the businesses and have risk governance and control responsibilities for enterprise programs. In this role, they are responsible for setting policies, standards and limits; providing risk reporting; monitoring for systemic risk issues including existing and emerging; and implementing procedures and controls at the enterprise and business levels for their respective control functions.  
  The Corporate Audit function and the Corporate General Auditor maintain independence from the businesses and governance and control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit also provides an independent assessment of the Corporation s management and internal control systems. Corporate Audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and operating information is materially complete, accurate and reliable; and employees  actions are in compliance with the Corporation s policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations. 
  To assist the Corporation in achieving its goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies, we utilize a risk management process that is applied across the execution of all business activities. This risk management process, which is an integral part of our Risk Framework, enables the Corporation to review risk in an integrated and comprehensive manner across all risk categories and make strategic and business decisions based on that comprehensive view. Corporate goals and objectives are

     established by management, and management reflects these goals and objectives in our risk appetite which is approved by the Board and serves as a key driver for setting business and risk strategy. 
  One of the key tools of the risk management process is the use of Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs). RCSAs are the primary method for facilitating the management of Business Environment and Internal Control Factor data. The end-to-end RCSA process incorporates risk identification and assessment of the control environment; monitoring, reporting and escalating risk; quality assurance and data validation; and integration with the risk appetite. The RCSA process also incorporates documentation by either the business or governance and control functions of the business environment, risks, controls, and monitoring and reporting. This results in a comprehensive risk management view that enables understanding of and action on operational risks and controls for all of our processes, products, activities and systems. 
  The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the actions of our employees are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code of Ethics, we set a high standard for our employees. The Code of Ethics provides a framework for all of our employees to conduct themselves with the highest  

integrity. We instill a strong and comprehensive risk management culture through communications, training, policies, procedures, and organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the link between the employee performance management process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals. 
  Board Oversight of Risk 
  The Board, comprised of a majority of independent directors, including an independent Chairman of the Board, oversees the management of the Corporation through a governance structure that includes Board committees and management committees. The Board s standing committees that oversee the management of the majority of the risks faced by the Corporation include the Audit and Enterprise Risk Committees, comprised of independent directors, and the Credit Committee, comprised of non-management directors. This governance structure is designed to align the interests of the Board and management with those of our stockholders and to foster integrity throughout the Corporation.  
  The chart below illustrates the inter-relationship between the Board, Board committees and management committees with the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation.

Table of Contents  

     Our Board s Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees have the principal responsibility for assisting the Board with enterprise-wide oversight of the Corporation s management and handling of risk. 
  Our Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight of, among other things, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and the overall effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Our Audit Committee also, taking into consideration the Board s allocation of the review of risk among various committees of the Board, discusses with management guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and risk management are undertaken, including the assessment of our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. 
  Our Credit Committee oversees, among other things, the identification and management of our credit exposures on an enterprise-wide basis, our responses to trends affecting those exposures, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and our credit related policies.  
  Our Enterprise Risk Committee, among other things, oversees our identification of, management of and planning for, material risks on an enterprise-wide basis, including market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational risk. Our Enterprise Risk Committee also oversees our capital management and liquidity planning. 
  Each of these committees regularly reports to our Board on risk-related matters within the committee s responsibilities, which collectively provides our Board with integrated, thorough insight about our management of our enterprise-wide risks. At meetings of our Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees and our Board, directors receive updates from management regarding enterprise risk management, including our performance against our risk appetite.  
  Executive management develops for Board approval the Corporation s Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement, and financial operating plans. Management monitors, and the Board oversees, through the Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees, financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite, and the adequacy of internal controls. 
    Strategic Risk Management 
  Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational and operational risk. In the financial services industry, strategic risk is elevated due to changing customer, competitive and regulatory environments. Our appetite for strategic risk is assessed within the context of the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully considered in the context of the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition  

and assessed, managed and acted on by the CEO and executive management team. Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions, require review and approval of the Board. 
  Executive management approves a strategic plan every two to three years. Annually, executive management develops a financial operating plan that implements the strategic goals for that year, and the Board reviews and approves the plan. With oversight by the Board, executive management ensures that the plans are consistent with the Corporation s strategic plan, core operating tenets and risk appetite. The following are assessed in their reviews: forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. At the business level, as we introduce new products, we monitor their performance to evaluate expectations (e.g., for earnings and returns on capital). With oversight by the Board, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize between achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. 
  We use proprietary models to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The economic capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk exposures. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use economic capital to define business strategies, price products and transactions, and evaluate client profitability. For additional information on how this measure is calculated, see   Supplemental Financial Data   on page   38  . 
    Capital Management 
  Bank of America manages its capital position to ensure capital is sufficient to support our business activities and that capital, risk and risk appetite are commensurate with one another, ensure safety and soundness under adverse scenarios, take advantage of growth and strategic opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements.  
  To determine the appropriate level of capital, we assess the results of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), the current economic and market environment, and feedback from investors, rating agencies and regulators. Based upon this analysis we set capital guidelines for Tier 1 common capital and Tier 1 capital to ensure we can maintain an adequate capital position in a severe adverse economic scenario. We also target to maintain capital in excess of the capital required per our economic capital measurement process. For additional information, see   Economic Capital   on page   75  . Management and the Board annually approve a comprehensive Capital Plan which documents the ICAAP and related results, analysis and support for the capital guidelines, and planned capital actions and capital adequacy assessment. 

Table of Contents  

     The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results, economic capital, qualitative risk assessments and assessment of regulatory changes. We generate monthly regulatory capital and economic capital forecasts that are aligned to the most recent earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts. We utilize quarterly stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity for a variety of economic stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in the forecasts, stress tests or economic capital. Given the significant proposed regulatory capital changes, we also regularly assess the potential capital impacts and monitor associated mitigation actions. Management continuously assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees. 
  Capital management is integrated into the risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of the strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. Economic capital is allocated to each business unit and used to perform risk-adjusted return analysis at the business unit, client relationship and transaction levels. 
  Regulatory Capital 
  As a financial services holding company, we are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines (Basel I) issued by federal banking regulators. At   December 31, 2011  , we operated banking activities primarily under two charters: BANA and FIA Card Services, N.A. (FIA). Under these guidelines, the Corporation and its affiliated banking entities measure capital adequacy based on Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital). Capital ratios are calculated by dividing each capital amount by risk-weighted assets. Additionally, Tier 1 capital is divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets to derive the Tier 1 leverage ratio. 
  Tier 1 capital is calculated as the sum of  core capital elements.  The predominate components of core capital elements are qualifying common stockholders  equity and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Also included in Tier 1 capital are qualifying trust preferred securities (Trust Securities), hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries which are subject to the rules governing  restricted core capital elements.  Goodwill, other disallowed intangible assets, disallowed deferred tax assets and the cumulative changes in fair value of all financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option that are included in retained earnings and are attributable to changes in the company s own creditworthiness are deducted from the sum of the core capital elements. Total capital is Tier 1 plus supplementary Tier 2 capital elements such as qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a portion of net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities. Tier 1 common capital is not  

an official regulatory ratio, but was introduced by the Federal Reserve during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program in 2009. Tier 1 common capital is Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, Trust Securities, hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. 
  Risk-weighted assets are calculated for credit risk for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures and for market risk on trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Credit risk risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning a prescribed risk-weight to all on-balance sheet assets and to the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight is defined in the regulatory rules based upon the obligor or guarantor type and collateral if applicable. Off-balance sheet exposures include financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives. Market risk risk-weighted assets are calculated using risk models for the trading account positions, including all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of the applicable accounting guidance. Under Basel I there are no risk-weighted assets calculated for operational risk. Any assets that are a direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets consistent with regulatory guidance. 
  The Corporation has issued notes to certain unconsolidated corporate-sponsored trust companies which issued Trust Securities and hybrid securities. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance, Trust Securities continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits. As a result, the Corporation includes qualifying Trust Securities in Tier 1 capital. The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which the Corporation s outstanding Trust Securities in the aggregate amount of $16.1 billion (approximately 125 bps of Tier 1 capital) at   December 31, 2011   will be excluded from Tier 1 capital, with the exclusion to be phased in incrementally over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2013. This amount excludes $633 million of hybrid Trust Securities that are expected to be converted to preferred stock prior to the date of implementation. The treatment of Trust Securities during the phase-in period is unknown and is subject to future rulemaking.  
  For additional information on these and other regulatory requirements, see   Note 18   Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Capital Composition and Ratios 
  Tier 1 common capital   increased     $1.6 billion   to   $126.7 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   2010  . The increase was driven primarily by the sale of CCB shares, the exchanges of preferred shares, Trust Securities and hybrid securities for common stock and debt, and the warrants issued in connection with the investment made by Berkshire, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets disallowed for regulatory capital purposes. The sales related to CCB increased Tier 1 common capital $6.4  

Table of Contents  

     billion, or approximately 55 bps, while the exchanges increased Tier 1 common capital $3.9 billion, or approximately 29 bps. The warrants related to Berkshire, increased Tier 1 common capital approximately $2.1 billion, or 15 bps. The $8.1 billion increase in the deferred tax asset disallowance at   December 31, 2011   compared to   2010   was primarily due to the expiration of the longer look-forward period granted by regulators at the time of the Merrill Lynch acquisition and an increase in net deferred tax assets. Tier 1 capital and Total capital   decreased     $4.4 billion   and   $14.5 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   2010  . For additional information regarding the sale of our investment in CCB, see   Note 5   Securities     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . For additional information regarding the exchanges and the investment made by Berkshire, see   Note 13   Long-term Debt   and   Note 15   Shareholders  Equity     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Risk-weighted assets   decreased     $172 billion   to   $1,284 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   2010  . The decrease was driven in part by our sale of CCB shares and our Canadian card business and is consistent with our continued efforts to reduce non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios. The Tier 1 common capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the Total capital ratio   increased   due to the decline in risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1  

leverage ratio   increased   compared to   2010   reflecting the decrease in Tier 1 capital and a reduction in adjusted quarterly average total assets.

       Regulatory Capital Changes 
  We manage regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy based on our current understanding of the rules and the application of such rules to our business as currently conducted. The regulatory capital rules as written by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) continue to evolve. 
  We currently measure and report our capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel I. See   Capital Management   on page   71   for additional information. Basel I has been subject to revisions, which include final Basel II rules (Basel II) published in December 2007 by U.S banking regulators and proposed Basel  

III rules (Basel III) published by the Basel Committee in December 2010, and further amended in July 2011. We are currently in the Basel II parallel period. 
  On December 29, 2011, U.S. regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) that would amend a December 2010 NPR on the Market Risk Rules. This amended NPR is expected to increase the capital requirements for our trading assets and liabilities. We continue to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules and currently anticipate that we will be in compliance with any final rules by the projected implementation date in late 2012.    

Table of Contents  

     If implemented by U.S. banking regulators as proposed, Basel III could significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of Trust Securities from Tier 1 capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing that the disqualification be phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets, MSRs, investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others, within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of accumulated OCI in capital, increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements. For additional information on deferred tax assets and MSRs, see   Note 21   Income Taxes     and     Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  .   The phase-in period for the capital deductions is proposed to occur in 20 percent increments from 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by December 31, 2018. An increase in capital requirements for counterparty credit risk is proposed to be effective January 2013. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur between 2013 and 2019. U.S. banking regulators have not yet issued proposed regulations that will implement these requirements. 
  Preparing for the implementation of the new capital rules is a top strategic priority, and we expect to comply with the final rules when issued and effective. We intend to continue to build capital through retaining earnings, actively reducing legacy asset portfolios and implementing other capital related initiatives, including focusing on reducing both higher risk-weighted assets and assets currently deducted, or expected to be deducted under Basel III, from capital. We expect non-core asset sales to play a less prominent role in our capital strategy in future periods. 
  On June 17, 2011, U.S. banking regulators proposed rules requiring all large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit a comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The proposed regulations require BHCs to demonstrate adequate capital to support planned capital actions, such as dividends, share repurchases or other forms of distributing capital. CCAR submissions are subject to the review and approval of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may require BHCs to provide prior notice under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution. On January 5, 2012, we submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve consistent with the proposed rules. The capital plan includes the ICAAP and related results, analysis and support for the capital guidelines, and planned capital actions. The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results, economic capital, qualitative risk assessments and assessment  

of regulatory changes, all of which influence the capital adequacy assessment. 
  On July 19, 2011, the Basel Committee published the consultative document  Globally systemic important banks: Assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement  which sets out measures for global, systemically important financial institutions including the methodology for measuring systemic importance, the additional capital required (the SIFI buffer), and the arrangements by which they will be phased in. As proposed, the SIFI buffer would be met with additional Tier 1 common equity ranging from   one percent   to   2.5 percent  , and in certain circumstances,   3.5 percent  . This will be phased in from 2016 through 2018. U.S. banking regulators have not yet provided similar rules for U.S. implementation of a SIFI buffer. 
  Given that the U.S. regulatory agencies have issued neither proposed rulemaking nor supervisory guidance on Basel III, significant uncertainty exists regarding the eventual impacts of Basel III on U.S. financial institutions, including us. These regulatory changes also require approval by the U.S. regulatory agencies of analytical models used as part of our capital measurement and assessment, especially in the case of more complex models. If these more complex models are not approved, it could require financial institutions to hold additional capital, which in some cases could be significant. 
  Based on the assumed approval of these models and our current assessment of Basel III, continued focus on capital management, expectations of future performance and continued efforts to build a fortress balance sheet, we currently anticipate that our Tier 1 common equity ratio will be between 7.25 percent and 7.50 percent by the end of 2012, assuming phase-in per the regulations at that time of all deductions scheduled to occur between 2013 and 2019.  
  On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements and the early remediation requirements established under the Financial Reform Act. The enhanced standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, single-counterparty credit limits, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for certain companies determined to pose a threat to financial stability. Comments on the proposed rules are due by March 31, 2012. The final rules are likely to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.  
  For additional information regarding Basel II, Basel III, Market Risk Rules and other proposed regulatory capital changes, see   Note 18   Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  .

   Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. Regulatory Capital 
  Table 15   presents regulatory capital information for BANA and FIA at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

BANA s Tier 1 capital ratio   increased     96   bps to   11.74 percent   and the Total capital ratio   increased     91   bps to   15.17 percent   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   2010  . The increase in the ratios was driven by $9.6 billion in earnings generated during   2011  . The Tier 1 leverage ratio   increased     82   bps to   8.65 percent  , benefiting from the improvement in Tier 1 capital combined with a $73.4 billion decrease in adjusted quarterly average total assets resulting from our continued efforts to reduce non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios.  
  FIA s Tier 1 capital ratio   increased     233   bps to   17.63 percent   and the Total capital ratio   increased     207   bps to   19.01 percent   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   2010  . The Tier 1 leverage ratio   increased     101   bps to   14.22 percent   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   2010  . The increase in ratios was driven by $5.7 billion in earnings generated during   2011   and a reduction in risk-weighted assets. 
  During   2011  , BANA paid dividends of $9.8 billion to Bank of America Corporation. FIA returned capital of $7.0 billion to Bank of America Corporation during   2011   and is anticipated to return an additional $3.0 billion in 2012.  
  Broker/Dealer Regulatory Capital 
  The Corporation s principal U.S. broker/dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith (MLPF S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the CFTC Regulation 1.17. 
  MLPF S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At   December 31, 2011  , MLPF S s regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $10.8 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $803 million by $10.0 billion. MLPCC s net capital of $3.5 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $168 million by approximately $3.3 billion. 

In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. At   December 31, 2011  , MLPF S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. 
  Economic Capital 
  Our economic capital measurement process provides a risk-based measurement of the capital required for unexpected credit, market and operational losses over a one-year time horizon at a 99.97 percent confidence level. Economic capital is allocated to each business unit based upon its risk positions and contribution to enterprise risk, and is used for capital adequacy, performance measurement and risk management purposes. The strategic planning process utilizes economic capital with the goal of allocating risk appropriately and measuring returns consistently across all businesses and activities. Economic capital allocation plans are incorporated into the Corporation s financial plan which is approved by the Board on an annual basis.  
  Credit Risk Capital 
  Economic capital for credit risk captures two types of risks: default risk, which represents the loss of principal due to outright default or the borrower s inability to repay an obligation in full, and migration risk, which represents potential loss in market value due to credit deterioration over the one-year capital time horizon. Credit risk is assessed and modeled for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures within sub-categories for commercial, retail, counterparty and investment securities. The economic capital methodology captures dimensions such as concentration and country risk and originated securitizations. The economic capital methodology is based on the probability of default, loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and maturity for each credit exposure, and the portfolio correlations across exposures. See page   80   for more information on   Credit Risk Management  . 

Table of Contents  

     Market Risk Capital 
  Market risk reflects the potential loss in the value of financial instruments or portfolios due to movements in interest and currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, the implied volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and other economic and business factors. Bank of America s primary market risk exposures are in its trading portfolio, equity investments, MSRs and the interest rate exposure of its core balance sheet. Economic capital is determined by utilizing the same models the Corporation used to manage these risks including, for example, Value-at-Risk (VaR), simulation, stress testing and scenario analysis. See page   112   for additional information on   Market Risk Management  . 
  Operational Risk Capital 
  We calculate operational risk capital at the business unit level using actuarial-based models and historical loss data. We supplement the calculations with scenario analysis and risk control assessments. See   Operational Risk Management   on page   119   for more information. 
  Common Stock Dividends 
  Table 16   is a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during   2011   and through   February 23, 2012  .   

  Enterprise-wide Stress Testing 
  As a part of our core risk management practices, we conduct enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on our balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. Scenarios are selected by a group comprised of senior business, risk and finance executives. Impacts to each business from each scenario are then determined and analyzed, primarily by leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our Chief Financial Officer Risk Committee (CFORC), Asset Liability and Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) and the Board s Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and serves to inform decision making by management and the Board. We have made substantial investments to establish stress testing capabilities as a core business process. 

Liquidity Risk 
  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 
  We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. 
  Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. 
  The Enterprise Risk Committee approves the Corporation s liquidity policy and contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. The ALMRC, in conjunction with the Board and its committees, monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. ALMRC is responsible for managing liquidity risks and ensuring exposures remain within the established tolerance levels. ALMRC delegates additional oversight responsibilities to the CFORC, which reports to the ALMRC. The CFORC reviews and monitors our liquidity position, cash flow forecasts, stress testing scenarios and results, and implements our liquidity limits and guidelines. For more information, see   Board Oversight of Risk   on page   70  . Under this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining excess liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries; determining what amounts of excess liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning. 
  Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 
  We maintain excess liquidity available to Bank of America Corporation, or the parent company, and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These assets, which we call our Global Excess Liquidity Sources, serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. Our cash is primarily on deposit with central banks, such as the Federal Reserve. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global Excess Liquidity Sources in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. 

Table of Contents  

     Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources   increased     $42 billion   to   $378 billion   compared to   December 31, 2010   and were maintained as presented in   Table 17  . This increase was due primarily to liquidity generated by our bank subsidiaries through deposit growth, reductions in LHFS and other factors. Partially offsetting the increase were the results of our ongoing reductions of our debt footprint announced in 2010. 

As shown in   Table 17  , the Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to the parent company totaled   $125 billion   and   $121 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Typically, parent company cash is deposited overnight with BANA. 
  Table 18   presents the composition of Global Excess Liquidity Sources at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our bank subsidiaries at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   totaled   $222 billion   and   $180 billion  . These amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company presented in   Table 17  . In addition to their Global Excess Liquidity Sources, our bank subsidiaries hold significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe could also be used to generate liquidity, primarily investment-grade MBS. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was approximately $189 billion and $170 billion at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or non-bank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval. 
  Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our broker/dealer subsidiaries at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   totaled   $31 billion   and   $35 billion  . Our broker/dealers also held significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe could also be used to generate additional liquidity, including investment-grade securities and equities. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary  

is only available to meet the obligations of that entity and can only be transferred to the parent company or to any other subsidiary with prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. 
  Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling 
  We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is  Time to Required Funding.  This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity and issuances under the FDIC s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), all of which will mature by June 30, 2012. The Corporation has established a target for Time to Required Funding of 21 months. Our Time to Required Funding at   December 31, 2011   was 29 months. For purposes of calculating Time to Required Funding for   December 31, 2011  , we have also included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the $8.6 billion liability related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. This settlement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions, and the timing of the payment is not certain. 
  We utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. These models are risk sensitive and have become increasingly important in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows beyond those outflows considered in the Time to Required Funding analysis.  
  We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. These scenarios incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit ratings downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries. We consider and utilize scenarios based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.  
  The types of contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals and reduced rollover of maturing term deposits by customers; increased draws on loan commitment and liquidity facilities, including Variable Rate Demand Notes; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were further downgraded; collateral, margin and subsidiary capital requirements arising from losses; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities.  
  We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.

     Basel III Liquidity Standards 
  In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued  International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring,  which includes two proposed measures of liquidity risk. These two minimum liquidity measures were initially introduced in guidance in December 2009 and are considered part of Basel III.  
  The first proposed liquidity measure is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is calculated as the amount of a financial institution s unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The second proposed liquidity measure is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Basel Committee expects the LCR requirement to be implemented in January 2015 and the NSFR requirement to be implemented in January 2018, following an observation period that began in 2011. We continue to monitor the development and the potential impact of these proposals, and assuming adoption by U.S. banking regulators, we expect to meet the final standards within the regulatory timelines. 
  Diversified Funding Sources 
  We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.  
  We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposit base, which was   $1,033 billion   and   $1,010 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Deposits are primarily generated by our   Deposits  ,   Global Commercial Banking  ,   GWIM   and   GBAM   segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including securitizations and FHLB loans.  
  Our trading activities in broker/dealer subsidiaries are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. 
  We reduced our use of unsecured short-term borrowings at the parent company and broker/dealer subsidiaries, including commercial paper and master notes, to relatively insignificant amounts in   2011  . These short-term borrowings were used to support customer activities, short-term financing requirements  

and cash management objectives. For average and period-end balance discussions, see   Balance Sheet Overview   on page   34  . For more information, see   Note 12   Federal Funds Sold, Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Short-term Borrowings     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Our mortgage business accesses a liquid market for the sale of newly originated mortgages through contracts with the GSEs and FHA. Contracts with the GSEs are subject to the seller/servicer guides issued by the GSEs.  
  We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the parent company. During   2011  , the parent company issued $21.0 billion of long-term unsecured debt. We may also issue long-term unsecured debt at BANA, although there were no new issuances during   2011  . 
  We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.  
  The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. 
  At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , our long-term debt was in the currencies presented in   Table 19  . 

Total long-term debt   decreased     $76.2 billion  , or   17 percent   in   2011  . This decrease reflects our ongoing initiative to reduce our debt footprint over time, and we anticipate that we will continue to reduce our debt footprint as appropriate through 2013. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt securities in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, we also may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For additional information on long-term debt funding, see   Note 13   Long-term Debt     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see   Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities   on page   116  . 

Table of Contents  

     We also diversify our unsecured funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured liabilities, which are debt obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivative positions and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured liability obligations for cash or other securities immediately under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured liabilities with a book value of $50.9 billion and $61.1 billion at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  .  
  Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.  
  Prior to 2010, we participated in the TLGP, which allowed us to issue senior unsecured debt that the FDIC guaranteed in return for a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt. At   December 31, 2011  , we had $23.9 billion outstanding under the program. We no longer issue debt under this program and all of our debt issued under TLGP will mature by June 30, 2012. TLGP issuances are included in the unsecured contractual obligations for the Time to Required Funding metric. Under this program, our debt received the highest long-term ratings from the major credit rating agencies which resulted in a lower total cost of issuance than if we had issued non-FDIC guaranteed long-term debt. 
  Contingency Planning 
  We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. 
  Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. 
  Credit Ratings 
  Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings. 
  Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are  

subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies which consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time and provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels. 
  Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies  methodologies for our industry or certain security types, the rating agencies  assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies, our mortgage exposures, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, funding costs, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives. 
  Each of the three primary rating agencies, Moody s, S P and Fitch, downgraded the Corporation and its subsidiaries in late 2011. They have each also indicated that, as a systemically important financial institution, our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government. They have indicated that they will continue to assess this view of support as financial services regulations and legislation evolve. On December 15, 2011, Fitch downgraded the Corporation s and BANA s long-term and short-term debt ratings as a result of Fitch s decision to lower its  support floor  for systemically important U.S. financial institutions. This downgrade resolves the Rating Watch Negative Fitch placed on the Corporation s ratings on October 22, 2010. On November 29, 2011, S P downgraded the Corporation s long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANA s long-term debt rating as a result of S P s implementation of revised methodologies for determining Banking Industry Country Risk Assessments and bank ratings. On September 21, 2011, Moody s downgraded the Corporation s long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANA s long-term debt rating as a result of Moody s lowering the amount of uplift for potential U.S. government support it incorporates into ratings. On February 15, 2012, Moody s placed the Corporation s long-term debt ratings and BANA s long-term and short-term debt ratings on review for possible downgrade as part of its review of financial institutions with global capital markets operations. Any adjustment to our ratings will be determined based on Moody s review; however, the agency offered guidance that downgrades to our ratings, if any, would likely be limited to one notch. The rating agencies could make further adjustments to our ratings at any time and provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels. 
  Currently, the Corporation s long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies are as follows: Baa1/P-2 (negative) by Moody  A-/A-2 (negative) by S  and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. BANA s long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks currently are as follows: A2/P-1 (negative) by Moody  A/A-1 (negative) by S  and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. MLPF S s long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks are A/A-1 (negative) by S P and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. Merrill Lynch International s long-term/short-term senior debt ratings are A/A-1 (negative) by S P. The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch from the three primary credit rating agencies are the same as those of Bank of America Corporation. The primary credit rating agencies have indicated that the major drivers of Merrill Lynch s credit ratings are Bank of America Corporation s credit ratings.

     A further reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker/dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing, and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.  
  At December 31, 2011, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements would have been approximately   $1.6 billion   comprised of   $1.2 billion   for BANA and approximately   $375 million   for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries. If the agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for these entities by a second incremental notch, approximately   $1.1 billion   in additional collateral comprised of   $871 million   for BANA and   $269 million   for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries, would have been required.  
  Also, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2011 was   $2.9 billion  , against which   $2.7 billion   of collateral had been posted. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries a second incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2011 was an incremental   $5.6 billion  , against which   $5.4 billion   of collateral had been posted. 
  While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of consequences of a credit ratings downgrade to a financial institution are inherently uncertain, as they depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a firm s long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. 
  For information regarding the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit ratings downgrade, see   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   and   Item 1A. Risk Factors  .  
  During the third quarter of 2011, Moody s and S P placed the sovereign rating of the United States on review for possible downgrade due to the possibility of a default on the government s debt obligations because of a failure to increase the debt limit.  

On August 2, 2011, Moody s affirmed its Aaa rating and revised its outlook to negative. On August 5, 2011, S P downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States to AA+, and affirmed the short-term sovereign credit rating; the outlook is negative. On November 28, 2011, Fitch affirmed its AAA long-term rating of the United States, but changed the outlook from stable to negative. On the same day, Fitch affirmed its F1+ short-term rating of the U.S. All three rating agencies have indicated that they will continue to assess fiscal projections and consolidation measures, as well as the medium-term economic outlook for the United States. 
    Credit Risk Management 
  Credit quality continued to improve during   2011  . Continued economic stability and our proactive credit risk management initiatives positively impacted the credit portfolio as charge-offs and delinquencies continued to improve across most portfolios and risk ratings improved in the commercial portfolios. However, global and national economic uncertainty, home price declines and regulatory reform continued to weigh on the credit portfolios through   December 31, 2011  . For more information, see   Executive Summary   2011 Economic and Business Environment   on page   27  . 
  Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for these categories of assets is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties     with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current mark-to-market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded credit exposures. For additional information on derivative and credit extension commitments, see   Note 4   Derivatives   and   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below. 

Table of Contents  

     We proactively refine our underwriting and credit management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have expanded collections, loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We also have implemented a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories. 
  Since January 2008, and through   2011  , Bank of America and Countrywide have completed over one million loan modifications with customers. During   2011  , we completed over 225,000 customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $49.9 billion, including approximately 104,000 permanent modifications under the government s Making Home Affordable Program. Of the loan modifications completed in   2011  , in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans, most were in the portfolio serviced for investors and were not on our balance sheet. The most common types of modifications include a combination of rate reduction and capitalization of past due amounts which represent 60 percent of the volume of modifications completed in   2011  , while principal forbearance represented 19 percent, principal reductions and forgiveness represented six percent and capitalization of past due amounts represented eight percent. These modification types are generally considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see   Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity   on page   92   and   Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress. In early 2012, S P, Fitch and Moody s downgraded the credit ratings of several European countries, and S P downgraded the credit rating of the EFSF, adding to concerns about investor appetite for continued support in stabilizing the affected countries. Uncertainty in the progress of debt restructuring negotiations and the lack of a clear resolution to the crisis has led to continued volatility in the European financial markets, and if the situation worsens, may spread into the global financial markets. In December 2011, the ECB announced initiatives to address European bank liquidity and funding concerns by providing low-cost three-year loans to banks, and expanding collateral eligibility. While these initiatives may reduce systemic risk, there remains considerable uncertainty as to future developments regarding the European debt crisis. For additional information on our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in non-U.S. countries, see   Non-U.S. Portfolio   on page   104   and   Item 1A. Risk Factors  . 

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 
  Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to help make both new and existing credit decisions and portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and economic capital allocations for credit risk. 
  For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Consumer Credit Portfolio 
  Improvement in the U.S. economy and labor markets during 2011 resulted in lower credit losses in most consumer portfolios during   2011   compared to   2010  . However, continued stress in the housing market, including declines in home prices, continued to adversely impact the home loans portfolio. 
  Table 20   presents our outstanding consumer loans and the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Loans that were acquired from Countrywide and considered credit-impaired were recorded at fair value upon acquisition. In addition to being included in the  Outstandings  columns in   Table 20  , these loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting adjustments, in the  Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio  column. For additional information, see   Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . The impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate. See   Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio   on page   89   for more information. Under certain circumstances, loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition have been subsequently modified from pay option or subprime loans into loans with more conventional terms and are now included in the residential mortgage portfolio, but continue to be classified as PCI loans as shown in   Table 20  .

    Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of   $906 million   and discontinued real estate loans of   $1.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011  . There were no consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option at   December 31, 2010  . See   Consumer Credit Risk   Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option   on page   92   and   Note 23   Fair Value Option     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information on the fair value option.

    Table 21   presents accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more and consumer nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer non-real estate-secured loans or unsecured consumer loans as these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans, which include loans insured by the FHA and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio), are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal  

repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily related to our purchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due. For additional information on FHA loans, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Unresolved Claims Status   on page   57  . 

(1)   
    Balances accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. These balances include   $17.0 billion   and   $8.3 billion   of loans on which interest has been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore are no longer accruing interest, although principal is still insured and   $4.2 billion   and   $8.5 billion   of loans on which interest was still accruing at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . 
               (2)   
    Balances exclude consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At   December 31, 2011  , approximately   $713 million   of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest. There were no consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2010.

    Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. 
       
    Net charge-off ratios excluding the Countrywide PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios were   2.27 percent   and   1.86 percent   for residential mortgage,   3.77 percent   and   5.10 percent   for home equity, 7.14 percent and 4.20 percent for discontinued real estate and 3.62 percent and 5.08 percent for the total consumer portfolio for   2011   and   2010  . These are the only product classifications materially impacted by the Countrywide PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios for   2011   and   2010  .  
  Legacy Asset Servicing within   CRES   manages our exposures to certain residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate products. Legacy Asset Servicing manages both our owned loans, as well as loans serviced for others, that meet certain criteria. The criteria generally represent home lending standards which we do not consider as part of our continuing core business. The Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio includes the following:

    We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real  

estate portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolios on page   89  .

     Residential Mortgage 
  The residential mortgage portfolio, which for purposes of the consumer credit portfolio discussion and related tables, excludes the discontinued real estate portfolio acquired from Countrywide, makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 43 percent of consumer loans at   December 31, 2011  . Approximately 14 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in   GWIM   and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients. The remaining portion of the portfolio is mostly in   All Other   and is comprised of both originated loans as well as purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities. 
  Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding   $906 million   of loans accounted for under the fair value option,   increased     $4.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   December 31, 2010   as new origination volume, the majority of which is fully-insured, was partially offset by paydowns, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties. In addition, repurchases of FHA delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA also   increased   the residential mortgage portfolio during   2011  . At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the residential mortgage portfolio included   $93.9 billion   and   $67.2 billion   of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of FHA insurance and long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , $24.0 billion and $20.1 billion were related to repurchases of FHA delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA and the remainder of the fully-insured portfolio represents originations that were retained on-balance sheet.  
  At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , principal balances of $23.8 billion and $12.9 billion were protected by long-term stand-by agreements. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses. 
  In addition to the abovementioned long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC, we have mitigated a portion  

of our credit risk on the residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic securitization vehicles as described in   Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the synthetic securitization vehicles referenced principal balances of   $23.9 billion   and   $53.9 billion   of residential mortgage loans and provided loss protection up to   $783 million   and   $1.1 billion  . At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation had a receivable of   $359 million   and   $722 million   from these vehicles for reimbursement of losses. The Corporation records an allowance for credit losses on loans referenced by the synthetic securitization vehicles. The reported net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio do not include the benefit of amounts reimbursable from these vehicles. Adjusting for the benefit of the credit protection from the synthetic securitizations, the residential mortgage net charge-off ratio, excluding the Countrywide PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, for   2011   would have been reduced by 13 bps and eight bps for   2010  . 
  Synthetic securitizations and the long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC together reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , these programs had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $7.9 billion and $8.2 billion, increased our Tier 1 capital ratio by eight bps and six bps, and our Tier 1 common capital ratio by six bps and five bps. 
  Table 24   presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude these loan portfolios is more representative of the credit risk in the residential mortgage loan portfolio. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, see page   89  .

     Nonperforming residential mortgage loans   decreased     $1.7 billion   compared to   December 31, 2010   as outflows outpaced new inflows, which continued to slow in   2011   due to favorable delinquency trends. Accruing loans past due 30 days or more   decreased     $1.2 billion   to   $4.0 billion   at   December 31, 2011  . At   December 31, 2011  , $11.4 billion, or 71 percent, of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. Net charge-offs   increased     $162 million   to   $3.8 billion   in   2011  , or   2.27 percent   of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to   1.86 percent   for   2010  . This   increase   in net charge-offs for   2011   was primarily driven by further deterioration in home prices on loans greater than 180 days past due which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, partially offset by favorable delinquency trends. Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower loan balances primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations. 
  Loans in the residential mortgage portfolio with certain characteristics have greater risk of loss than others. These characteristics include loans with a high refreshed LTV, loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007, interest-only loans and loans to borrowers located in California and Florida where we have concentrations and where significant declines in home prices have been experienced. Although the following disclosures address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which contributed to a disproportionate share of the losses in the portfolio. The residential mortgage loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised six percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , but accounted for 23 percent of the residential mortgage net charge-offs in   2011   and 26 percent in   2010  . 
  Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed LTV represented   11 percent   of the residential mortgage portfolio at both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented   26 percent   and   24 percent   of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Of the loans with  

a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 92 percent and 88 percent were performing at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent due primarily to home price deterioration over the past several years. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented   15 percent   of the residential mortgage portfolio at both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . 
  Of the   $158.5 billion   and   $180.1 billion   in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , as shown in   Table 24  , 40 percent and 38 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $13.3 billion, or 21 percent, at   December 31, 2011  . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. As of   December 31, 2011  , $484 million, or four percent, of outstanding residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $4.0 billion, or two percent, of accruing past due 30 days or more for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at   December 31, 2011  , $2.0 billion, or 15 percent, of outstanding residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming compared to $16.0 billion, or 10 percent, of nonperforming loans for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio have an interest-only period of three to 10 years and more than 80 percent of these loans will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2015 or later. 
  Table 25   presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 12 percent and 13 percent of outstandings at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , but comprised only seven percent of net charge-offs for both   2011   and   2010  .

     The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , our CRA portfolio was $12.5 billion and $13.8 billion, or eight percent of the residential mortgage loan balances for both periods. The CRA portfolio included $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion of nonperforming loans at   December 31, 2011 and 2010   representing 15 percent and 17 percent of total nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Net charge-offs related to the CRA portfolio were $732 million and $857 million for   2011   and   2010  , or 19 percent and 23 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio.  
  For information on representations and warranties related to our residential mortgage portfolio, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Representations and Warranties   on page   56   and   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Home Equity 
  The home equity portfolio makes up   20 percent   of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of HELOCs, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. As of   December 31, 2011  , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $103.4 billion or 83 percent of the home equity portfolio. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years with approximately 11 percent of the portfolio having a draw period of five years with a five-year renewal option. During the initial draw period, the borrowers are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans.  
  As of   December 31, 2011  , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $20.2 billion, or 16 percent of the home equity portfolio. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans  

with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and approximately 52 percent of these loans have 25 to 30-year terms.  
  As of   December 31, 2011  , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.1 billion, or one percent of the total home equity portfolio. In 2011, we exited the reverse mortgage origination business. 
  At   December 31, 2011  , approximately 88 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in   CRES   while the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in   GWIM  . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio   decreased     $13.3 billion   in   2011   primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , $24.5 billion, or 20 percent, and $24.8 billion, or 18 percent, were in first-lien positions (22 percent and 20 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio). As of   December 31, 2011  , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $37.2 billion, or 33 percent, of our home equity portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. 
  Unused HELOCs totaled $67.5 billion at   December 31, 2011   compared to $80.1 billion at   December 31, 2010  . This decrease was due primarily to customers choosing to close accounts as well as line management initiatives on deteriorating accounts, which more than offset new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 61 percent at   December 31, 2011   compared to 59 percent at   December 31, 2010  . 
  Table 26   presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis as well as excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio.

    The following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. 
  Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio   decreased     $241 million   compared to   December 31, 2010   driven primarily by charge-offs and nonperforming loans returning to performing status which together outpaced  

delinquency inflows, which continued to slow during   2011   due to favorable early stage delinquency trends. Accruing outstanding balances past due 30 days or more   decreased     $271 million   in   2011  . At   December 31, 2011  , $1.1 billion, or 43 percent, of the nonperforming home equity portfolio was 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their fair values.

     In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is current, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio in which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans in which the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a second- or more junior-lien loan. As of   December 31, 2011  , we estimate that   $4.7 billion   of current second- or more junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $1.3 billion of that amount, with the remaining $3.4 billion serviced by third parties. Of the   $4.7 billion   current second-lien loans, we estimate based on available credit bureau data as discussed above that approximately $2.5 billion had first-lien loans that were 120 days or more past due, of which approximately $2.1 billion had first-lien loans serviced by third parties.  
  Net charge-offs   decreased     $2.3 billion   to   $4.5 billion  , or   3.77 percent   of the total average home equity portfolio, for   2011   compared to   $6.8 billion  , or   5.10 percent  , for   2010   primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in the U.S. economy. In addition, the net charge-off amounts during   2010   were impacted by the implementation of regulatory guidance on collateral-dependent modified loans which resulted in $822 million in net charge-offs. Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower outstanding balances primarily as a result of paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. 
  There are certain characteristics of the outstanding loan balances in the home equity portfolio that have contributed to higher losses including those loans with a high refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV), loans that were originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007 and loans in geographic areas that have experienced the most significant declines in home prices. Home price declines coupled with the fact that most home equity outstandings are secured by second-lien positions have significantly reduced and, in some cases, eliminated all collateral value after consideration of the first-lien position. Although the disclosures below address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in outstanding balances with these characteristics, which has contributed to a disproportionate share of losses in the portfolio. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised 10 percent of the total home equity portfolio at both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , but have accounted for 28 percent of the home equity net charge-offs in 2011 and 29 percent in   2010  . 

Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed CLTVs comprised   11 percent   of the home equity portfolio at both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Outstanding balances with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 percent comprised   32 percent   and   30 percent   of the home equity portfolio at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Home price deterioration over the past several years has contributed to an increase in CLTV ratios. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current at   December 31, 2011  . For second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent that are current, 89 percent were also current on the underlying first-lien loans at   December 31, 2011  . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented   12 percent   of the home equity portfolio at both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . 
  Of the   $112.7 billion   in total home equity portfolio outstandings, 78 percent and 75 percent at   December 31, 2011 and 2010   were originated as interest-only loans, almost all of which were HELOCs. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $1.6 billion, or two percent of total HELOCs, at   December 31, 2011  . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. As of   December 31, 2011  , $49 million, or three percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.4 billion, or one percent, of outstanding accruing past due 30 days or more for the entire HELOC portfolio. In addition, at   December 31, 2011  , $57 million, or four percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming compared to $2.0 billion, or two percent, of outstandings that were nonperforming for the entire HELOC portfolio. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and more than 85 percent of these loans will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2015 or later. 
  Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During   2011  , approximately 51 percent of these customers did not pay down any principal on their HELOCs.

     Table 27   presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . This MSA comprised seven percent and six percent of net charge-offs for   2011   and   2010  . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 12 percent and 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at   December 31, 2011 and  

2010  . This MSA comprised 12 percent and 11 percent of net charge-offs for   2011   and   2010  .

    Amount excludes the Countrywide PCI home equity loan portfolio. 
       Discontinued Real Estate 
  The discontinued real estate portfolio, excluding   $1.3 billion   of loans accounted for under the fair value option, totaled   $11.1 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and consists of pay option and subprime loans acquired in the Countrywide acquisition. Upon acquisition, the majority of the discontinued real estate portfolio was considered credit-impaired and written down to fair value. At   December 31, 2011  , the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio was   $9.9 billion  , or   89 percent   of the total discontinued real estate portfolio. This portfolio is included in   All Other   and is managed as part of our overall ALM activities. See   Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio   on page   89   for more information on the discontinued real estate portfolio. 
  At   December 31, 2011  , the purchased discontinued real estate portfolio that was not credit-impaired was   $1.2 billion  . Loans with greater than 90 percent refreshed LTVs and CLTVs comprised 28 percent of the portfolio and those with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 44 percent of the portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 16 percent of outstanding discontinued real estate loans at   December 31, 2011  . 
  Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included in the discontinued real estate portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually, subject to resetting of the loan if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully-amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five- or 10-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest  

limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loan s principal balance to reach a certain level within the first 10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully-amortizing payment is required. 
  The difference between the frequency of changes in a loan s interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest is added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. 
  At   December 31, 2011  , the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans was $11.7 billion, with a carrying amount of $9.9 billion, including $9.0 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition, and accordingly, are reserved for based on a life-of-loan loss estimate. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $9.5 billion including $672 million of negative amortization. For those borrowers who are making payments in accordance with their contractual terms, the percentage electing to make only the minimum payment on option ARMs was 72 percent at   December 31, 2011   and 69 percent at   December 31, 2010  . We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans including the Countrywide PCI pay option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration several assumptions regarding this evaluation including prepayment and default rates. Of the loans in the pay option portfolio at   December 31, 2011   that have not already experienced a payment reset, seven percent are expected to reset in 2012 and approximately 17 percent are expected to reset thereafter. In addition, approximately seven percent are expected to prepay and approximately 69 percent are expected to default prior to being reset, most of which were severely delinquent as of   December 31, 2011  .

     Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio 
  Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows to be collected from the purchaser s initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition  

date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. PCI loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or recording a valuation allowance in the initial accounting. 
  Table 28   presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . 

Of the unpaid principal balance at   December 31, 2011  , $12.7 billion was 180 days or more past due, including $9.0 billion of first-lien and $3.7 billion of home equity. Of the $22.1 billion that is less than 180 days past due, $19.1 billion, or 86 percent of the total unpaid principal balance was current based on the contractual terms while $1.6 billion, or seven percent, was in early stage delinquency. During   2011  , we recorded $2.1 billion of provision for credit losses for the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio including $1.1 billion for discontinued real estate, $667 million for home equity loans and $355 million for residential mortgage. This compared to a total provision of $2.3 billion in   2010  . Provision expense in   2011   was driven primarily by a more negative home price outlook versus previous expectations. For further information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, see   Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Additional information is provided in the following sections on the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios. 
  Purchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio 
  The Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio comprised   31 percent   of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 38 percent of the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at   December 31, 2011  . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent represented 62 percent of the  

Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, and 84 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at   December 31, 2011  . Those loans that were originally classified as Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition and have been subsequently modified are now included in the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage outstandings.   Table 29   presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations.

     Purchased Credit-impaired Home Equity Loan Portfolio 
  The Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio comprised   38 percent   of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 27 percent of the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio at   December 31, 2011  . Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent represented 81 percent of the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, and 83 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at   December 31, 2011  .   Table 30   presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations. 

Purchased Credit-impaired Discontinued Real Estate Loan Portfolio 
  The Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio comprised   31 percent   of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 61 percent of the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio at   December 31, 2011  . Loans with a refreshed LTV, or CLTV in the case of second-liens, greater than 90 percent represented 40 percent of the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, and 84 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at   December 31, 2011  . Those loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition and have been subsequently modified are now excluded from this portfolio and included in the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio, but remain in the PCI loan pool.   Table 31   presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation adjustment, by certain state concentrations. 

U.S. Credit Card 
  The consumer U.S. credit card portfolio is managed in   Card Services  . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card loan portfolio   decreased     $11.5 billion   compared to   December 31, 2010   due to higher payment rates, charge-offs and portfolio divestitures. For   2011  , net charge-offs   decreased     $5.8 billion   to   $7.3 billion   compared to   2010   due to improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest   decreased     $2.1 billion   while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest   decreased     $1.3 billion   compared to   December 31, 2010   due to improvement in the U.S. economy.   Table 32   presents certain key credit statistics for the consumer U.S. credit card portfolio.

    Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases. 
       
  Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $368.1 billion and $399.7 billion at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . The $31.6 billion decrease was driven by portfolio divestitures, closure of inactive accounts and account management initiatives on higher risk accounts.

   Table 33   presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio. 

Non-U.S. Credit Card 
  During 2011, we sold our Canadian consumer card business and we are evaluating our remaining international consumer card portfolios. In light of these actions, the international consumer card portfolios were moved from   Card Services   to   All Other  .  
  Outstandings in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio   decreased     $13.0 billion   in   2011   primarily due to the sale of the Canadian consumer credit card portfolio, lower origination volume and charge-offs. Net charge-offs   decreased     $1.0 billion   in   2011   to   $1.2 billion   due to the sale of previously charged-off loans, portfolio sales, and improvements in delinquencies, collections and insolvencies.  
  Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $36.8 billion and $60.3 billion at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . The $23.5 billion decrease was driven primarily by the sale of the Canadian consumer credit card portfolio. 
  Table 34   presents certain key credit statistics for the non-U.S. credit card portfolio.

    Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases. 

Direct/Indirect Consumer 
  At   December 31, 2011  , approximately 48 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in   Global Commercial Banking   (dealer financial services - automotive, marine, aircraft and recreational vehicle loans), 36 percent was included in   GWIM   (principally other non-real estate-secured, unsecured personal loans and securities-based lending margin loans), nine percent was included in   Card Services   (consumer personal loans) and the remainder was in   All Other   (student loans). 
  Outstanding loans and leases   decreased     $595 million   to   $89.7 billion   in   2011   due to lower outstandings in the   Card Services   unsecured consumer lending portfolio partially offset by     growth in securities-based lending and product transfers from U.S. commercial. For   2011  , net charge-offs   decreased     $1.9 billion   to   $1.5 billion  , or   1.64 percent   of total average direct/indirect loans compared to   3.45 percent   for   2010  . This decrease was primarily driven by improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a result of an improved economic environment as well as reduced outstandings. An additional driver was lower net charge-offs in the dealer financial services portfolio due to the impact of higher credit quality originations and higher resale values. 
  Net charge-offs in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio decreased $1.6 billion to $1.1 billion in   2011  , or 10.93 percent of total average unsecured consumer lending loans compared to 17.24 percent for   2010  . Net charge-offs in the dealer financial services portfolio decreased $199 million to $293 million in 2011, or 0.69 percent of total average dealer financial services loans compared to 1.08 percent for 2010. Direct/indirect loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest declined $745 million to $1.9 billion at   December 31, 2011   compared to $2.6 billion at   December 31, 2010   due to improvements     in both the unsecured consumer lending and dealer financial services portfolios.

   Table 35   presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio. 

Other Consumer 
  At   December 31, 2011  , approximately 96 percent of the   $2.7 billion   other consumer portfolio was associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited and non-U.S. consumer loan portfolios that are included in   All Other  . The remainder is primarily deposit overdrafts in   Deposits  . 
  Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option 
  Outstanding consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option were   $2.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and include   $1.3 billion   of discontinued real estate loans and   $906 million   of residential mortgage loans as a result of the consolidation of VIEs. During   2011  , we recorded losses of $837 million resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These losses were offset by gains recorded on the related long-term debt.  
  Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity 
  Table 36   presents nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties activity during   2011   and   2010  . Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans and in general, past due consumer loans not secured by real estate as these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. The fully-insured loan portfolio is not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio or loans that we account for under the fair value option. For further information on nonperforming loans, see   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . Nonperforming loans declined to   $18.8 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   $20.9 billion   at   December 31, 2010  . Delinquency inflows to nonperforming loans slowed compared to the prior year due to favorable portfolio trends and were more than offset by charge-offs, nonperforming loans returning to performing status, and paydowns and payoffs. 
  The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value, after reducing the estimated property value for estimated costs to sell, is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes  

180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At   December 31, 2011  , $14.6 billion, or 71 percent, of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less estimated costs to sell, including $12.6 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $2.0 billion of foreclosed properties. 
  Foreclosed properties   increased     $742 million   in   2011   as additions outpaced liquidations. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date. However, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. Net changes to foreclosed properties related to PCI loans increased $411 million in   2011  . Not included in foreclosed properties at   December 31, 2011   was $1.4 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of delinquent FHA-insured loans. We hold this real estate on our balance sheet until we convey these properties to the FHA. We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the FHA for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. For additional information on the review of our foreclosure processes, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Other Mortgage-related Matters   on page   63  . 
  Restructured Loans 
  Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation s loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower s sustained repayment performance under revised payment terms for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, are included in   Table 36  . 
  As a result of accounting guidance on PCI loans, beginning January 1, 2010, modifications of loans in the PCI loan portfolio do not result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan pool. TDRs in the consumer real estate portfolio that were removed from the  

Table of Contents  

     PCI loan portfolio prior to the adoption of this accounting guidance were $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , of which $477 million and $426 million were nonper-forming. These nonperforming loans are excluded from   Table 36  . 

Nonperforming consumer real estate TDRs as a percentage of total nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties increased to 26 percent at   December 31, 2011   from 16 percent at   December 31, 2010  . 

(1)   
    Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of   $659 million   and   $1.0 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010   as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in   Table 21   and   Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
               (2)   
    2010   includes   $448 million   of nonperforming loans as a result of the consolidation of variable interest entities. 
               (3)   
    Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. 
               (4)   
    Our policy is to not classify consumer credit card and consumer loans not secured by real estate as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly, are excluded from this table. 
                (6)   
    Outstanding consumer loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 
       
    Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, all gains and losses in value are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties in   Table 36   are net of $352 million and $575 million of charge-offs for   2011   and   2010  , recorded during the first 90 days after transfer.  
  We also work with customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans, while complying with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. Substantially all of our credit card and other consumer loan modifications involve a reduction in the cardholder s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered to be TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). We make modifications primarily through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded from   Table 36  , as substantially all of these loans remain on accrual status until either charged-off or paid in full. At  

December 31, 2011  , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was   $7.1 billion  , of which   $5.5 billion   was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms compared to   $11.4 billion   at   December 31, 2010  , of which   $8.7 billion   was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by attrition throughout   2011   as well as lower new program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see   Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  As a result of new accounting guidance on TDRs, loans that are participating in or that have been offered a binding trial modification are classified as TDRs. At   December 31, 2011  , we classified an additional   $2.6 billion   of home loans as TDRs that were participating in or had been offered a trial modification. These home loans had an aggregate allowance for credit losses of   $154 million   at   December 31, 2011  . For additional information, see   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  .

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 
  Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship. Our business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses. 
  For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Management of Commercial Credit Risk 
  Concentrations 
  Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables   42  ,   47  ,   53   and   54   summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio.  

As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. 
  We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation s credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss). 
  Commercial Credit Portfolio 
  During   2011  , credit quality in the commercial loans portfolio showed improvement relative to   2010  . Commercial loans increased in   2011   primarily due to growth in commercial and industrial lending. Non-U.S. commercial loan growth, centered in corporate loans and trade finance, was driven by higher client demand, enterprise-wide initiatives, regional economic conditions and disruption in debt and equity markets leading to higher utilization. Growth in U.S. commercial loans was driven by domestic economic momentum. This was partially offset by declines in commercial real estate loans as net paydowns and sales outpaced new originations and renewals. 

Table of Contents  

     Reservable criticized balances, net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances in the commercial credit portfolio declined in   2011  . The reductions in reservable criticized and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property were primarily in the commercial real estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Commercial real estate continued to show improvement during   2011   compared to   2010   in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. However, levels of  

stressed commercial real estate loans remain elevated. The reduction in reservable criticized U.S. commercial loans was driven by broad-based improvements in terms of clients, industries and businesses. Most other credit indicators across the remaining commercial portfolios also improved.  
  Table 38   presents our commercial loans and leases, and related credit quality information at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  .

    Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option include U.S. commercial loans of   $2.2 billion   and   $1.6 billion  , non-U.S. commercial loans of   $4.4 billion   and   $1.7 billion  , and commercial real estate loans of   $0   and   $79 million   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . See   Note 23   Fair Value Option     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information on the fair value option. 
       
    Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases were   2.02 percent   and   3.32 percent   (  2.04 percent   and   3.35 percent   excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Accruing commercial loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases were   0.10 percent   and   0.21 percent   (  0.10 percent   and   0.22 percent   excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  .  
  Table 39   presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our  

commercial loans and leases for   2011   and   2010  . Improving portfolio trends drove lower charge-offs and higher recoveries across most of the portfolio. Commercial real estate net charge-offs during   2011     declined   in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs   declined   primarily due to improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies. U.S. commercial charge-offs   decreased   during   2011   due to broad-based declines from improvements in client profiles, industries and businesses.

     Table 40   presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs, financial guarantees, bankers  acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which the Corporation is legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial committed credit exposure   increased     $10.4 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   December 31, 2010   driven primarily by increases in loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in SBLCs, LHFS and bankers  acceptances.  

Total commercial utilized credit exposure   increased     $6.1 billion   in   2011   driven primarily by increases in loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in SBLCs, LHFS and bankers  acceptances. Utilized loans and leases increased primarily due to growth and higher revolver utilization in our international franchise, and were partially offset by run-off in the commercial real estate portfolio and the transfer of securities-based lending exposures from our U.S. commercial portfolio to the consumer portfolio during 2011. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, and bankers  acceptances was   57 percent   at both   December 31, 2011   and   2010  .

    Total commercial utilized exposure at   December 31, 2011 and 2010   includes loans outstanding of   $6.6 billion   and   $3.3 billion   and letters of credit with a notional value of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion accounted for under the fair value option.

Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional derivative collateral held of $16.1 billion and $17.7 billion which consists primarily of other marketable securities. 
         
    Table 41   presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure   decreased     $15.4 billion  , or   36 percent  , in   2011   due to broad-based decreases across most portfolios, primarily in commercial real estate and U.S. commercial  

driven largely by continued paydowns, sales and ratings upgrades outpacing downgrades. Despite the improvements, utilized reservable criticized levels remain elevated, particularly in commercial real estate and U.S. small business commercial. At   December 31, 2011  , approximately 85 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured compared to 88 percent at   December 31, 2010  .

    Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category. 
       U.S. Commercial 
  At   December 31, 2011  , 58 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in   Global     Commercial Banking   and 30 percent in   GBAM  . The remaining 12 percent was mostly in   GWIM   (business-purpose loans for wealthy  

clients). U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option,   increased     $4.4 billion   in   2011   due to continued growth and higher revolver utilization across the portfolio. This increase was net of a product reclassification for certain trade loans to non-U.S. commercial in 2011, as well as  

Table of Contents  

     the transfer of securities-based lending loans to the consumer portfolio earlier in 2011, which together totaled $5.3 billion. Reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans and leases   declined     $5.5 billion   and   $1.3 billion   in   2011  . The declines were broad-based in terms of clients and industries and were driven by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net charge-offs   decreased     $686 million   in   2011   due to broad-based declines from credit quality improvements mentioned above, driving lower charge-offs and higher recoveries. 
  Commercial Real Estate 
  The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in   Global Commercial Banking   and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans   decreased     $9.8 billion   in   2011   due to paydowns and sales, which outpaced new originations and renewals. Over 90 percent of this decrease occurred within reservable criticized. 
  The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration of commercial real estate loans and leases at   20 percent   and   18 percent   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . For more information on geographic and property concentrations, see  

Table 42  . 
  Credit quality for commercial real estate continued to show signs of improvement; however, we expect that elevated unemployment and ongoing pressure on vacancy and rental rates will continue to affect primarily the non-homebuilder portfolio. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties   decreased     31 percent   in   2011  , split evenly across the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. The decline in nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the non-homebuilder portfolio was driven by decreases in the shopping centers/retail, land and land development, and office property types. Reservable criticized balances   decreased     $9.0 billion   primarily due to declines in the office, shopping centers/retail and multi-family rental property types in the non-homebuilder portfolio and improvement in the homebuilder portfolio. Net charge-offs   declined     $1.1 billion   in   2011   due to improvement in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolio. 
  Table 42   presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region which is based on the geographic location of the collateral and property type. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate which is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.

    Other states primarily represents properties in the states of Colorado, Utah, Hawaii, Wyoming and Montana. 
        
    During   2011  , we continued to see improvement in the homebuilder portfolio. Certain portions of the non-homebuilder portfolio remain at risk as occupancy rates, rental rates and commercial property prices remain under pressure. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce utilized  

and potential exposure in the commercial real estate portfolios including refinement of our credit standards, additional transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of alternative resolution methods to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. 

Table of Contents  

     Tables   43   and   44   present commercial real estate credit quality data by non-homebuilder and homebuilder property types. The homebuilder portfolio presented in Tables   42  ,   43   and   44   includes condominiums and other residential real estate. Other property  

types in Tables   42  ,   43   and   44   primarily include special purpose, nursing/retirement homes, medical facilities and restaurants, as well as unsecured loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate.

    Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. 
       
    At   December 31, 2011  , total committed non-homebuilder exposure was $53.1 billion compared to $64.2 billion at   December 31, 2010  , with the decrease due to exposure reductions in all non-homebuilder property types. Non-homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties were   $3.5 billion   and   $4.6 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , which represented 9.29 percent and 10.08 percent of total non-homebuilder loans and foreclosed properties. Non-homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure   decreased   to   $10.1 billion  , or 25.34 percent of non-homebuilder utilized reservable exposure, at   December 31, 2011   compared to   $17.1 billion  , or 35.55 percent, at   December 31, 2010  . The decrease in reservable criticized exposure was driven primarily by office, shopping centers/retail and multi-family rental property types. For the non-homebuilder portfolio, net charge-offs   decreased     $862 million   in   2011   due in part to resolution of criticized assets through payoffs and sales. 

At   December 31, 2011  , we had committed homebuilder exposure of $3.9 billion compared to $6.0 billion at   December 31, 2010  , of which $2.4 billion and $4.3 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in homebuilder committed exposure was due to repayments, net charge-offs, reductions in new home construction and continued risk mitigation initiatives with market conditions providing fewer origination opportunities to offset the reductions. Homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties   decreased     $970 million   due to repayments, a decline in the volume of loans being downgraded to nonaccrual status and net charge-offs. Homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure   decreased     $2.0 billion   to   $1.4 billion   due to repayments and net charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the homebuilder portfolio were 38.89 percent and 54.65 percent at   December 31, 2011   compared to 42.80 percent and 74.27 percent at   December 31, 2010  . Net charge-offs for the homebuilder portfolio   decreased     $208 million   in   2011  .

     At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $10.9 billion and $19.1 billion of construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. The decline in construction and land development loans was driven by repayments, net charge-offs and continued risk mitigation initiatives which outpaced new originations. This portfolio is mostly secured and diversified across property types and geographic regions but faces continuing challenges in the housing and rental markets. Weak rental demand and cash flows along with depressed property valuations of land have contributed to elevated levels of reservable criticized exposure, nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties,     and net charge-offs. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $4.9 billion and $10.5 billion, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $2.1 billion and $4.0 billion at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . During a property s construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. Loans continue to be classified as construction loans until they are refinanced. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve. 
  Non-U.S. Commercial 
  The non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio is managed primarily in   GBAM  . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option,   increased     $23.4 billion   in   2011   from continued growth in corporate loans and trade finance due to client demand, enterprise-wide initiatives, regional economic conditions and disruption in debt and equity markets, along with the product reclassification from U.S. commercial in 2011. For additional information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see   Non-U.S. Portfolio   on page   104  . 

U.S. Small Business Commercial 
  The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of business card and small business loans managed in   Card Services   and   Global Commercial Banking  . U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs   declined     $923 million   in   2011   driven by improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies resulting from an improved economic environment as well as the reduction of higher risk vintages and the impact of higher credit quality originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 74 percent were credit card-related products for   2011   compared to 79 percent for   2010  . 
  Commercial Loans Carried at Fair Value 
  The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is managed primarily in   GBAM  . Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option   increased     $3.3 billion   to an aggregate fair value of   $6.6 billion   at   December 31, 2011   due primarily to increased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses of $174 million resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio during   2011   compared to net gains of   $82 million   in   2010  . These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. 
  In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of   $1.2 billion   and   $866 million   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was   $25.7 billion   and   $27.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . During   2011   we recorded net losses of   $429 million   from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit compared to net gains of   $23 million   in   2010  . These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities.

     Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 
  Table 45   presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during   2011   and   2010  . Nonperforming commercial loans and leases   decreased     $3.5 billion   during   2011   to   $6.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   driven by paydowns, charge-offs, returns to performing status and sales, partially offset by new nonaccrual loans in the commercial real  

estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Approximately 96 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are secured and approximately 51 percent are contractually current. In addition, commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 68 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less estimated costs to sell.

    Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. 
               (3)   
    Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. 
               (4)   
    Business card loans are not classified as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly are excluded from this table.

    Excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option. 
       
    As a result of the retrospective application of new accounting guidance on TDRs effective September 30, 2011, the Corporation classified   $1.1 billion   of commercial loan modifications as TDRs that in previous periods had not been classified as TDRs. These loans were newly identified as TDRs typically because the Corporation was not able to demonstrate that the modified rate of interest, although significantly higher than the rate prior to  

modification, was a market rate of interest. These newly identified TDRs did not have a significant impact on the allowance for credit losses or the provision for credit losses. Included in this amount was   $402 million   of performing commercial loans at   December 31, 2011   that were not previously considered to be impaired loans. For additional information, see   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 

Table of Contents  

   Table 46   presents our commercial TDRs by product type and status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated business card loans and are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. 

Industry Concentrations 
  Table 47   presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. The   increase   in commercial committed exposure of   $10.4 billion   in   2011   was concentrated in banks, diversified financials and energy, partially offset by lower real estate, insurance (including monolines) and other committed exposure.  
  Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Management s Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limit governance. 
  Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration, experienced an   increase   in committed exposure of   $8.2 billion  , or   nine percent  , in   2011   driven primarily by increases in consumer finance lending and traded products exposure.  
  Real estate, our second largest industry concentration, experienced a   decrease   in committed exposure of   $9.4 billion  , or   13 percent  , in   2011   due primarily to paydowns and sales which outpaced new originations and renewals. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 20 percent and 27 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see   Commercial Real Estate   on page   97  . 
  Committed exposure in the banking industry   increase  d   $9.1 billion  , or   31 percent  , in   2011   primarily due to increases in trade finance as a result of momentum from regional economies and growth initiatives in foreign markets.  
  Energy committed exposure increased $5.7 billion, or 22 percent, in   2011   due to increases in working capital lines for state-related enterprises and increases in large investment-grade energy companies. 
  Insurance, including monolines committed exposure,   decreased     $8.3 billion  , or   34 percent  , in   2011   due primarily to the settlement/termination of monoline positions. For more information on our monoline exposure, see   Monoline and Related Exposure   below.  
  Other committed exposure   decreased     $6.0 billion  , or   44  

percent  , in   2011   due to reductions primarily in traded products exposure.  
  The Corporation s committed state and municipal exposure of $46.1 billion at   December 31, 2011   consisted of $34.4 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $18.6 billion of funded loans, $11.3 billion of SBLCs and $4.1 billion of derivative assets) and unutilized commercial exposure of $11.7 billion (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the Government and public education industry in   Table 47  . Economic conditions continue to impact debt issued by state and local municipalities and certain exposures to these municipalities. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications surrounding certain at-risk counterparties and/or sectors are regularly circulated ensuring exposure levels are in compliance with established concentration guidelines. 
  Monoline and Related Exposure 
  Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. 
  We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities. 
  We also have indirect exposure to monolines in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the loan has declined, or we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantor s loss. For additional information regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Representations and Warranties   on page   56   and   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  .  

Table of Contents  

     During   2011  , we terminated all of our monoline contracts referencing super senior ABS CDOs and reclassified net monoline exposure with a carrying value of   $1.3 billion   (  $4.7 billion   gross receivable less impairment) at   December 31, 2011   from derivative assets to other assets because of the inherent default risk. Because these contracts no longer provide a hedge benefit, they are no longer considered derivative trading instruments. This exposure relates to a single counterparty and is recorded at fair value based on current net recovery projections. The net recovery projections take into account the present value of projected payments expected to be received from the counterparty. 
  Monoline derivative credit exposure had a notional value of   $21.1 billion   and   $38.4 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was   $1.8 billion   and   $9.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   with the decrease driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets, terminated monoline contracts and the reclassification of net monoline exposure to other assets mentioned above. The counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to monoline derivative exposure was   $417 million   and   $5.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . This adjustment reduced our net  

mark-to-market exposure to   $1.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   $3.9 billion   at   December 31, 2010   and covered   24 percent   of the mark-to-market exposure at   December 31, 2011  , down from   57 percent   at   December 31, 2010  . We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. For more information on our monoline exposure, termination of certain monoline contracts and the transfer of monoline exposure to other assets, see   GBAM   on page   49  . 
  We also have indirect exposure to monolines as we invest in securities where the issuers have purchased wraps. For example, municipalities and corporations purchase insurance in order to reduce their cost of borrowing. If the rating agencies downgrade the monolines, the credit rating of the bond may fall and may have an adverse impact on the market value of the security. In the case of default, we first look to the underlying securities and then to the purchased insurance for recovery. Investments in securities with purchased wraps issued by municipalities and corporations had a notional amount of $150 million and $2.4 billion at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Mark-to-market investment exposure was $89 million at   December 31, 2011   compared to $2.2 billion at   December 31, 2010  .

     Risk Mitigation 
  We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.  
  At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was   $19.4 billion   and   $20.1 billion  . The mark-to-market effects, including the cost of net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure, resulted in net gains of $121 million in   2011   compared to net losses of $546 million in   2010  . 

The average VaR for these credit derivative hedges was $60 million in   2011   compared to $53 million in   2010  . The average VaR for the related credit exposure was $74 million in   2011   compared to $65 million in   2010  . There is a diversification effect between the net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure and the related credit exposure such that the combined average VaR was $38 million in   2011   compared to $41 million in   2010  . See   Trading Risk Management   on page   113   for a description of our VaR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio.  
  Tables   48   and   49   present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . The distribution of debt ratings for net notional credit default protection purchased is shown as a negative amount.

    In addition to names which have not been rated,  NR  includes   $(15) million   and $(1.5) billion in net credit default swap index positions at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . While index positions are principally investment grade, credit default swap indices include names in and across each of the ratings categories. 
       
    In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a  

credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. 
  Table 50   presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. For information on our written credit derivatives, see   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  .

     The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in   Table 50   take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, while amounts disclosed in   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   are shown  

on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure. 

n/a = not applicable 
    Counterparty Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments 
  We record a counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment on certain derivative assets, including our credit default protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. These adjustments are necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment. All or a portion of these counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments are subsequently adjusted due to changes in the value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. 
  During   2011   and   2010  , credit valuation gains (losses) of   $(1.9) billion   and   $731 million   (  $(606) million   and   $(8) million  , net of hedges) for counterparty credit risk were recognized in trading account profits for counterparty credit risk related to derivative assets. For information on our monoline counterparty credit risk, see   GBAM           Collateralized Debt Obligation and Monoline Exposure   on page   51   and   Monoline and Related Exposure   on page   101  . 
    Non-U.S. Portfolio 
  Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is provided by the Regional Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC. 

Table 51   sets forth total non-U.S. exposure broken out by region at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Non-U.S. exposure includes credit exposure net of local liabilities, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Total non-U.S. exposure can be adjusted for externally guaranteed loans outstanding and certain collateral types. Exposures which are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Resale agreements are generally presented based on the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements.

     Our total non-U.S. exposure was   $232.6 billion   at   December 31, 2011  , a   decrease   of   $29.4 billion   from   December 31, 2010  . Our non-U.S. exposure remained concentrated in Europe which accounted for   $115.9 billion  , or   50 percent  , of total non-U.S. exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries. The   decrease   of   $32.2 billion   in Europe was primarily driven by our efforts to reduce risk in countries affected by the ongoing debt crisis in the Eurozone. Select European countries are further detailed in Table   54  . Asia Pacific was our second largest non-U.S. exposure at   $74.6 billion  , or   32 percent  . The   $1.3 billion     increase   in Asia Pacific was driven by increases in securities and local exposure in Japan and increases in the emerging markets, predominately in local exposure, loans and securities offset by the sale of CCB shares. For more information on our CCB investment, see   Note 5   Securities     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . Latin America accounted for   $17.4 billion  , or   seven percent  , of total non-U.S. exposure. The   $2.6 billion     increase   in Latin America was primarily driven by an increase in Brazil in securities and local country exposure. Middle East and Africa   increased     $926 million   to   $4.6 billion  , representing   two percent   of total non-U.S. exposure. Other non-U.S. exposure was   $20.1 billion   at   December 31, 2011  ,  

a   decrease   of   $2.1 billion   in   2011   resulting primarily from a decrease in local exposure as a result of the sale of our Canadian consumer card business. For more information on our Asia Pacific and Latin America exposure, see non-U.S. exposure to selected countries defined as emerging markets on page   106  . 
  Table 52   presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At   December 31, 2011  , the United Kingdom and Japan were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At   December 31, 2011  , Canada and France had total cross-border exposure of   $16.9 billion   and   $16.1 billion   representing   0.79 percent   and   0.75 percent   of total assets. Canada and France were the only other countries that had total cross-border exposure that exceeded   0.75 percent   of our total assets at   December 31, 2011  . 
  Exposure includes cross-border claims by our non-U.S. offices including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading account assets, securities, derivative assets, other interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts also include unused commitments, SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. Sector definitions are consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country Exposure Report.

     As presented in   Table 53  , non-U.S. exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets   decreased     $3.4 billion   to   $61.6 billion   at   December 31, 2011  . The   decrease   was due to the sale of CCB shares, partially offset by growth in the rest of  

Asia Pacific and other regions. Non-U.S. exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets represented   26 percent   and   25 percent   of total non-U.S. exposure at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  .

    There is no generally accepted definition of emerging markets. The definition that we use includes all countries in Asia Pacific excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand; all countries in Latin America excluding Cayman Islands and Bermuda; all countries in Middle East and Africa; and all countries in Central and Eastern Europe. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , there was   $1.7 billion   and   $460 million   in emerging market exposure accounted for under the fair value option.

    Generally, cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded from this presentation. 
               (5)   
    Cross-border exposure includes amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers or counterparties with a country of residence other than the one in which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. 
               (6)   
    Local country exposure includes amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers with a country of residence in which the credit is booked regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated. Local funding or liabilities are subtracted from local exposures consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Total amount of available local liabilities funding local country exposure was   $18.7 billion   and   $15.7 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Local liabilities at   December 31, 2011   in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa were   $17.3 billion  ,   $1.0 billion   and   $278 million  , respectively, of which   $9.2 billion   was in Singapore,   $2.3 billion   in China,   $2.2 billion   in Hong Kong,   $1.3 billion   in India,   $973 million   in Mexico and   $804 million   in Korea. There were no other countries with available local liabilities funding local country exposure greater than   $500 million  . 
               (7)   
    No country included in Other Asia Pacific, Other Latin America, Other Middle East and Africa, and Other Central and Eastern Europe had total non-U.S. exposure of more than   $500 million  .

     At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  ,   60 percent   and   70 percent   of our emerging markets exposure was in Asia Pacific. Emerging markets exposure in Asia Pacific   decreased   by   $8.5 billion   driven by a   $19.0 billion   decrease related to the sale of CCB shares, partially offset by increases in loans and securities predominately in India, China (excluding CCB) and South Korea.  
  At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  ,   26 percent   and   21 percent   of our emerging markets exposure was in Latin America. Latin America emerging markets exposure   increased     $2.5 billion   driven by increases in securities and local exposure in Brazil.  
  At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  ,   eight percent   and   six percent   of our emerging markets exposure was in Middle East and Africa, with an   increase   of   $926 million   primarily driven by increases in loans and derivatives in United Arab Emirates, and by increases in loans in Other Middle East and Africa. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  ,   six percent   and   three percent   of the emerging markets exposure was in Central and Eastern Europe, with the increase driven by an increase in loans in the Russian Federation. 
  Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress. Risks from the continued debt crisis in Europe could continue to disrupt the financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. Uncertainty in the progress of debt restructuring negotiations and the lack of a clear resolution to the crisis have led to continued volatility in European financial markets, as well as global financial markets. In December 2011, the ECB announced initiatives to address European bank liquidity and funding concerns by providing low-cost, three-year loans to banks, and expanding collateral eligibility. In early 2012, S P, Fitch and Moody s downgraded the credit ratings of several European countries, and S P downgraded the credit rating of the EFSF, adding to concerns about investor appetite for continued support in stabilizing the affected countries.  
  Table 54   shows our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, excluding consumer credit card exposure, in these countries at   December 31, 2011  . Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was   $15.3 billion   at December 31, 2011 compared to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2010. The total exposure to these countries, net of hedges, was  

$10.5 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   $12.4 billion   at   December 31, 2010  , of which   $252 million   and   $91 million   was total sovereign exposure. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of net credit default protection purchased was   $4.9 billion   and $4.2 billion. 
  We hedge certain of our selected European country exposure with credit default protection in the form of CDS. The majority of our CDS contracts are with highly-rated financial institutions primarily outside of the Eurozone and we work to limit or eliminate correlated CDS. Due to our engagement in market-making activities, our CDS portfolio contains contracts with various maturities to a diverse set of counterparties.  
  In addition to our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, a significant deterioration of the European debt crisis could result in material reductions in the value of sovereign debt and other asset classes, disruptions in capital markets, widening of credit spreads, loss of investor confidence in the financial services industry, a slowdown in global economic activity and other adverse developments. For additional information on the debt crisis in Europe, see   Item 1A. Risk Factors  . 
  Losses could still result even if there is credit default protection purchased because the purchased credit protection contracts only pay out under certain scenarios and thus not all losses may be covered by the credit protection contracts. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of these risks is influenced by a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS. Generally, only the occurrence of a credit event as defined by the CDS terms (which may include, among other events, the failure to pay by, or restructuring of, the reference entity) results in a payment under the purchased credit protection contracts. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Determination Committee (comprised of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS and facts and circumstances for the event. Accordingly, uncertainties exist as to whether any particular strategy or policy action for addressing European debt crisis would constitute a credit event under the CDS. A voluntary restructuring may not trigger a credit event under CDS terms and consequently may not trigger a payment under the CDS contract.

         Provision for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses   decreased     $15.0 billion   to   $13.4 billion   for   2011   compared to   2010  . The provision for credit losses was $7.4 billion lower than net charge-offs for   2011  , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses driven primarily by lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the   Card Services   portfolio, and improvement in overall credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by additions to consumer PCI loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a $5.9 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses in   2010  .  
  The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $11.1 billion to $14.3 billion for   2011   compared to   2010   reflecting improving economic conditions and improvement in the current and projected levels of delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the U.S. consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios. Also contributing to the decrease  

were lower credit costs in the non-PCI home equity loan portfolio due to improving portfolio trends, partially offset by higher credit costs in the residential mortgage portfolio primarily reflecting further deterioration in home prices. For the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our expected cash flows resulted in an increase in reserves of $2.2 billion in   2011   due primarily to our updated home price outlook. Reserve increases related to the consumer PCI loan portfolios in 2010 were also $2.2 billion. 
  The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including the provision for unfunded lending commitments, decreased $3.9 billion to a benefit of $915 million in   2011   compared to   2010   due to continued economic improvement and the resulting impact on property values in the commercial real estate portfolio, lower current and projected levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies in the U.S. small business commercial portfolio and improvement in borrower credit profiles across the remainder of the commercial portfolio.

     Allowance for Credit Losses 
  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
  The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components, as described below. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. 
  The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers nonperforming commercial loans and performing commercial loans that have been modified in a TDR, consumer real estate loans that have been modified in a TDR, renegotiated credit card, and renegotiated unsecured consumer and small business loans. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan s observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring and prior to any risk-based or penalty-based increase in rate on the restructured loans. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans. 
  The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses but are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of   December 31, 2011  , the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for most consumer portfolios, particularly the credit card and direct/indirect portfolios. 
  The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios are updated at least  

quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor s liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor s credit risk. When estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, management relies not only on models derived from historical experience but also on its judgment in considering the effect on probable losses inherent in the portfolios due to the current macroeconomic environment and trends, inherent uncertainty in models and other qualitative factors. As of   December 31, 2011  , updates to the loan risk ratings and portfolio composition resulted in reductions in the allowance for all commercial portfolios. 
  Also included within this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are reserves that are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty, large single name defaults, significant events which could disrupt financial markets and model imprecision.  
  We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. 
  Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. 
  The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in   Table 56   was   $29.6 billion   at   December 31, 2011  , a   decrease   of   $5.1 billion   from   December 31, 2010  . This   decrease   was primarily due to improving economic conditions and improvement in the current and projected levels of delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the U.S. consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios. With respect to the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our expected cash flows resulted in an increase in reserves through provision of $2.2 billion in   2011  , within the discontinued real estate, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios, primarily due to our updated home price outlook. Reserve increases related to the consumer PCI loan portfolios in   2010   were also $2.2 billion. 
  The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio was   $4.1 billion   at   December 31, 2011  , a   $3.0 billion     decrease   from   December 31, 2010  . The   decrease   was driven by improvement in the economy and the resulting impact on property values in the commercial real estate portfolio, improvement in projected delinquencies in the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, mostly within   Card Services  , and stronger borrower credit profiles in the U.S. commercial portfolios, primarily in   Global Commercial Banking   and   GBAM  . 
  The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was   3.68 percent   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   4.47 percent   at   December 31, 2010  . The   decrease   in the ratio was largely due to improved credit quality and economic conditions which led to the reduction in the  

Table of Contents  

     allowance for credit losses discussed above. The   December 31, 2011 and 2010   ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was   2.86 percent   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   3.94 percent   at   December 31, 2010  . 
  Absent unexpected deterioration in the economy, we expect  

reductions in the allowance for loan and lease losses to continue in   2012  . However, in both consumer and commercial portfolios, we expect these reductions to be less than those in   2011   and   2010  . 
  Table 55   presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for   2011   and   2010  .

There were no consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option at   December 31, 2010  . Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option included U.S. commercial loans of   $2.2 billion   and   $1.6 billion  , non-U.S. commercial loans of   $4.4 billion   and   $1.7 billion   and commercial real estate loans of   $0   and   $79 million   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  .

     Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 
  In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers  acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation s historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models. 
  The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at   December 31, 2011   was   $714 million  ,   $474 million     lower   than   December 31, 2010   driven by accretion of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired Merrill Lynch unfunded positions and improved credit quality in the unfunded portfolio. 
    Market Risk Management 
  Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, customer and other trading operations, the ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation. 
  Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. For further information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see   Note 22   Fair Value Measurements     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity, commodity, issuer, credit and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques. 

Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. 
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
  Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits. 
  Mortgage Risk 
  Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including CDOs using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. See   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles   and   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards and foreign currency-denominated debt. 
  Equity Market Risk 
  Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. 

Table of Contents  

     Commodity Risk 
  Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions. 
  Issuer Credit Risk 
  Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments. 
  Market Liquidity Risk 
  Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management. 

Trading Risk Management 
  Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see   Note 22   Fair Value Measurements     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. 
  The Global Markets Risk Committee (GRC), chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the primary governance authority for global markets risk management including trading risk management. The GRC s focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting   GBAM   and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact businesses outside of   GBAM   are monitored and governed by their respective governance authorities. 
  The GRC monitors significant daily revenues and losses by business and the primary drivers of the revenues or losses. Thresholds are in place for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an explanation of the variance is provided to the GRC. The thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses that exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility.

     The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for   2011   and   2010  . During   2011  , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 86 percent (214 days) of the trading days of which 66 percent (165 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million, five percent (12 days) of the trading days had losses greater than  

$25 million and the largest loss was $119 million. This is compared to   2010  , where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 90 percent (225 days) of the trading days of which 75 percent (187 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million, four percent (nine days) of the trading days had losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was $102 million. 

To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. VaR is a key statistic used to measure market risk. In order to manage day-to-day risks, VaR is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All limit excesses are communicated to management for review. 
  A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the worst loss the portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence and depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated. Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. 

A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are, however, many limitations inherent in a VaR model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance. Historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. Our VaR model utilizes three years of historical data. This time period was chosen to ensure that the VaR reflects both a broad range of market movements as well as being sensitive to recent changes in market volatility. 
  We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Nevertheless, due to the limitations previously discussed, we have historically used the VaR model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. 

Table of Contents  

     The accuracy of the VaR methodology is reviewed by backtesting, which involves comparing actual results against expectations derived from historical data, the VaR results against the daily profit and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the GRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. In periods of market stress, the GRC members communicate daily to discuss losses and VaR limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure. 

Our VaR model uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VaR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. The number of actual backtesting excesses observed is dependent on current market performance relative to historic market volatility. For most of   2011  , the three years of historical market data utilized for VaR included the volatile fourth quarter of 2008. Subsequent market volatility has generally been lower, and as a result, the size of the largest trading losses experienced since then has been lower than would be expected based on the VaR measure. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR in   2011   or   2010  . The graph below shows daily trading-related revenue and VaR for   2011  . 

Table 57   presents average, high and low daily trading VaR for   2011   and   2010  . 

(1)   
    The high and low for the total portfolio may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the individual portfolios may have occurred on different trading days. 
       
    The   $35 million   decrease in average VaR during   2011   was primarily due to a reduction in risk during the year. This was driven primarily by a decrease in credit exposures where average VaR decreased   $62 million   compared to   2010  . In addition, for   2010    

and   2011  , data from the more volatile periods of 2007 and 2008 were no longer included in our three-year historical dataset. These impacts were partially offset by a reduction in portfolio diversification VaR of   $37 million  . 

Table of Contents  

     Counterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures to reflect the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VaR component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not include it in our trading VaR, and it is therefore not included in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our histogram or used for backtesting. 
  Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 
  Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates, and is dependent on a limited lookback window, we also  stress test  our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes that occurred during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a 10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe point during a crisis, is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks from pre-defined market stress events. These stress events include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. As with the historical scenarios, the hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition to the value afforded by the results themselves, this information provides senior management with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is also integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. A process is in place to promote consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see page   76  . 
    Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities 
  Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. 
  We prepare forward-looking forecasts of core net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The core net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing  

assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. 
  The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics, but do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. The prepayment impact on amortization is reflected in the period in which a prepayment is forecasted to occur. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect core net interest income and capital. 
  Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they provide a comprehensive view of the Corporation s interest rate risk exposure and are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. Given the low level of short-end rates, we have determined that gradual downward shifts of 50 bps applied to the short-end of the market-based forward curve provide a more realistic view of potential exposure resulting from changes in interest rates. This replaced the 100 bps downward shift scenarios applied to the short-end of the market-based forward curve previously presented. In addition, a long-end flattener of (50) bps was added for comparability purposes. 
  The spot and 12-month forward monthly rates used in our baseline forecast at   December 31, 2011 and 2010   are presented in   Table 58  . 

Table 59   shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income over the next twelve months from   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , resulting from a gradual parallel increase and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. For further discussion of core net interest income, see page   39  . 

Table of Contents  

     The sensitivity analysis in   Table 59   assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated periods. Our core net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates at both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The significant decline in long-end rates contributed to the increase in asset sensitivity between   2011   and   2010  . 
  Securities 
  The securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM position and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and to a lesser extent U.S. Treasury, corporate, municipal and other debt securities. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , we held AFS debt securities of   $276.2 billion   and   $337.6 billion  . During   2011   and   2010  , we purchased AFS debt securities of   $99.5 billion   and   $199.2 billion  , sold   $116.8 billion   and   $97.5 billion  , and had maturities and received paydowns of   $56.7 billion   and   $70.9 billion  . We realized   $3.4 billion   and   $2.5 billion   in net gains on sales of debt securities during   2011   and   2010  . We securitized no mortgage loans into MBS during   2011   compared to   $2.4 billion   in   2010  , which we retained. 
  During   2011  , we purchased approximately   $35.6 billion   of U.S. agency MBS which are classified as held-to-maturity securities. The purchases of these securities are part of our long-term investment activities which include holding these securities to maturity. The classification of these securities as held-to-maturity also mitigates accumulated OCI volatility and possible negative impacts on our regulatory capital requirements under the Basel III capital standards. The contractual maturities of the held-to-maturity securities are greater than 10 years and they are subject to prepayment by the issuers. 
  Accumulated OCI included after-tax net unrealized gains of   $3.1 billion   and   $7.4 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , comprised primarily of after-tax net unrealized gains of   $3.1 billion   and   $714 million   related to AFS debt securities and after-tax net unrealized gains of   $3 million   and   $6.7 billion   related to AFS marketable equity securities. The   December 31, 2010   unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was related to our investment in CCB. See   Note 5   Securities     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   for further discussion on marketable equity securities. The net unrealized gains in accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities increased   $3.9 billion   during   2011   to   $5.0 billion  , primarily due to a lower interest rate environment.  
  We recognized   $299 million   of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses in earnings on AFS debt securities in   2011   compared to $970 million on AFS debt and marketable equity securities in   2010  . The recognition of OTTI losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the security including credit ratings and any specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, other industry and macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. 
  Residential Mortgage Portfolio 
  At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , our residential mortgage portfolio was   $262.3 billion   (which excludes   $906 million   in  

residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option) and   $258.0 billion  . For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see   Consumer Credit Risk   Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option   on page   92  . Outstanding residential mortgage loans   increased     $4.3 billion   in   2011   as new origination volume was partially offset by paydowns, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties. In addition, we repurchased $7.8 billion of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA which also increased the residential mortgage portfolio during   2011  . 
  During   2011   and   2010  , we retained $45.5 billion and $63.8 billion in first-lien mortgages originated by   CRES   and   GWIM  . We received paydowns of $42.3 billion and $38.2 billion in   2011   and   2010  . There were no loans securitized in   2011   compared to   $2.4 billion   of loans securitized into MBS which we retained in   2010  . We recognized gains of $68 million on the securitizations completed in   2010  . We purchased $72 million of residential mortgages related to ALM activities in   2011   compared to none in   2010  . We sold $109 million and $443 million of residential mortgages in   2011   and   2010  , of which all of the   2011   sales were originated residential mortgages and $432 million of the   2010   sales were originated residential mortgages and $11 million were previously purchased from third parties. Net gains on these transactions were minimal. 
  Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 
  Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For additional information on our hedging activities, see   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.  
  Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during   2011   reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions.   Table 60   includes derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Our interest rate swap positions, including foreign exchange contracts, were a net receive-fixed position of $67.9 billion and $6.4 billion at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . The notional amount of our foreign exchange basis swaps was   $262.4 billion   and   $235.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Our futures and forwards notional position, which reflects the net of long and short positions, was a long position of   $12.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to a short position of   $280 million   at  

Table of Contents  

     December 31, 2010  . These changes in notional amounts are the result of ongoing interest rate and currency risk management positioning. 
  The fair value of net ALM contracts   decreased     $7.9 billion   to a   gain   of   $4.7 billion   at   December 31, 2011   compared to   $12.6 billion   at   December 31, 2010  . The   decrease   was primarily  

attributable to changes in the value of U.S. dollar-denominated pay-fixed interest rate swaps of   $9.7 billion  , foreign exchange contracts of   $1.8 billion   and foreign exchange basis swaps of   $1.4 billion  . The decrease was partially offset by a gain from the changes in the value of U.S. dollar-denominated receive-fixed interest rate swaps of   $6.6 billion  . 

(1)   
    At both   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the receive-fixed interest rate swap notional amounts that represented forward starting swaps and which will not be effective until their respective contractual start dates totaled $1.7 billion. The forward starting pay-fixed swap positions at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   were $8.8 billion and $34.5 billion. 
               (2)   
    Does not include basis adjustments on either fixed-rate debt issued by the Corporation or AFS debt securities which are hedged using derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. 
               (3)   
    At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the notional amount of same-currency basis swaps consisted of   $222.6 billion   and   $152.8 billion   in both foreign currency and U.S. dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. 
               (4)   
    Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps. 
               (5)   
    Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain non-U.S. debt issued by the Corporation that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. 
                (7)   
    Reflects the net of long and short positions. 
               (8)   
    The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of   $52.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   was comprised of   $40.6 billion   in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps,   $647 million   in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps, and   $12.4 billion   in net foreign currency forward rate contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of   $109.5 billion   at   December 31, 2010   were comprised of   $57.6 billion   in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps and   $52.0 billion   in net foreign currency forward rate contracts. There were  no foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps at   December 31, 2010  . 

Table of Contents  

     We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, were   $3.8 billion   and   $3.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at   December 31, 2011  , the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.5 billion, or 26 percent within the next year, 55 percent in years two through five, and 12 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining seven percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see   Note 4   Derivatives     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax gains on derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by losses on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at   December 31, 2011  . 
    Mortgage Banking Risk Management 
  We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 
  Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and service fee income. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used as economic hedges of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS was $14.7 billion and $129.0 billion. 
  MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, Eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, as well as mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities as economic hedges of MSRs. The notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs were $2.6 trillion and $46.3 billion at  

December 31, 2011   compared to $1.6 trillion and $60.3 billion at   December 31, 2010  . In   2011  , we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $6.3 billion related to the change in fair value of these economic hedges compared to $5.0 billion for   2010  . For additional information on MSRs, see   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   and for more information on mortgage banking income, see   CRES   on page   43  . 
    Compliance Risk Management 
  Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to laws, rules, regulations, and internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk can expose the Corporation to reputational risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations. Compliance is at the core of the Corporation s culture and is a key component of risk management discipline.  
  The Global Compliance organization is responsible for driving a culture of compliance, establishing compliance program standards and policies; executing, monitoring and testing of business controls; performing risk assessments on the businesses  adherence to laws, rules and standards as well as effectiveness of business controls; delivering compliance risk reporting; and ensuring the identification, escalation, and timely mitigation of emerging and existing compliance risks. Global Compliance is also responsible for facilitating processes to effectively manage and influence the dynamic regulatory environment and build constructive relationships with regulators. 
  The Board provides oversight of compliance risks through its Audit Committee. 
    Operational Risk Management 
  The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, not solely in operations functions, and its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Global banking guidelines and country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were established in Basel II which require that the Corporation has internal operational risk management processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures. 
  Under the Basel II Rules, an operational loss event is an event that results in a loss and is associated with any of the following seven operational loss event categories: internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and execution, delivery and process management. Specific examples of loss events include robberies, credit card fraud, processing errors and physical losses from natural disasters. 
  Under our Operational Risk Management Program, we approach operational risk management from two perspectives to best manage operational risk within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2) at  

Table of Contents  

     the business and enterprise control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporation s Operational Risk Management Program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the CRO and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporation s overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the Operational Risk Committee (ORC) oversees and approves the Corporation s policies and processes for sound operational risk management. The ORC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The ORC reports operational risk activities to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board. 
  Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to the businesses, enterprise control functions, senior management, governance committees and the Board. 
  The business and enterprise control functions are responsible for all the risks within the business line, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and RCSAs, operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor risk in each business and enterprise control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business recovery planning and new product introduction processes. The business and enterprise control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring adherence to corporate practices.  
  Business and enterprise control function management uses the enterprise risk and control self-assessment process to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goal of this process is to assess changing market and business conditions, to evaluate key risks impacting each business and enterprise control function and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. The risk and control self-assessment process is documented at periodic intervals. Key operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on an enterprise, business and enterprise control function level. Independent review and challenge to the Corporation s overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Corporate Operational Risk Validation Team. 
  The enterprise control functions participate in the operational risk management process in two ways. First, these organizations manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide specialized risk management services (e.g., information management, vendor management) within their area of expertise to the enterprise and the businesses and other enterprise control functions they support. These groups also work with business and risk executives to develop and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each business and enterprise control function relative to these programs. 
  Additionally, where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses when and if they occur. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As  

insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits. 
    Complex Accounting Estimates 
  Our significant accounting principles, as described in   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   are essential in understanding the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. 
  The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that, with the exception of accrued taxes, involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. 
  Allowance for Credit Losses 
  The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation s loan portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolio s inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries, and borrowers  or counterparties  ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions. 
  Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for  

Table of Contents  

     consumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to address current events and conditions, considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit conditions. 
  Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our home loans, and credit card and other consumer portfolio segments. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our home loans portfolio segment, excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at   December 31, 2011   would have increased by $156 million. PCI loans within our home loans portfolio segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However, subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one percent decrease in the expected cash flows could result in a $241 million impairment of the portfolio, of which $115 million would be related to our discontinued real estate portfolio. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our credit card and other consumer portfolio segment coupled with a one percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at   December 31, 2011   would have increased by $84 million. 
  Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within our commercial portfolio segment. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased by $3.1 billion at   December 31, 2011  . 
  The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at   December 31, 2011   was   3.68 percent   and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to 4.00 percent. 
  These sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote. 
  The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions. 
  Mortgage Servicing Rights 
  MSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income. Commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage  

MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method, lower of amortized cost or fair value, with impairment recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income. At   December 31, 2011  , our total MSR balance was   $7.5 billion  . 
  We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs, and the option-adjusted spread levels. These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could materially affect our operating results. For example, decreasing the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our consumer MSRs by 10 percent while keeping all other assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated increase of   $639 million   in MSRs and mortgage banking income at   December 31, 2011  . This impact does not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk. 
  We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations, securities as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income. For more information, see   Mortgage Banking Risk Management   on page   119  . 
  For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of weighted-average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions, see   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, certain MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS, other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. For more information, see   Note 22   Fair Value Measurements   and   Note 23   Fair Value Option     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  The fair values of assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality and other deal specific factors, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be  

Table of Contents  

     more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered by the knowledge of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. 
  Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more of the rating agencies. 
  Trading account profits, which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use  

trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VaR modeling, which estimates a potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. For more information on VaR, see   Trading Risk Management   on page   113  . 
  The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for our own credit risk. The credit adjustments are determined by reference to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where direct references are not available, a proxy is applied consistent with direct references for other counterparties that are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market implied experience adjusted for any more recent name specific expectations. 
  Level 3 Assets and Liabilities 
  Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include consumer MSRs, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts and private equity investments, as well as certain loans, MBS, ABS, structured liabilities and CDOs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

Table of Contents  

(1)   
    Level 3 total assets and liabilities are shown before the impact of counterparty netting related to our derivative positions. 
       
    During   2011  , we recognized net gains of   $451 million   on Level 3 assets and liabilities. The net gains during the year were primarily in trading account profits combined with gains on IRLCs, partially offset by losses on MSRs. There were net unrealized gains of   $19 million   in accumulated OCI on Level 3 assets and liabilities at   December 31, 2011  . 
  Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs, may be economically hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. 
  We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For additional information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during   2011  , see   Note 22   Fair Value Measurements     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Global Principal Investments 
  GPI is included within Equity Investments in   All Other   on page   54  . GPI is comprised of a diversified portfolio of private equity, real estate and other alternative investments in both privately-held and publicly-traded companies. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. At   December 31, 2011  , this portfolio totaled   $5.6 billion   including $4.3 billion of non-public investments. 
  Certain equity investments in the portfolio are subject to investment company accounting under applicable accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value with changes  

in fair value reported in equity investment income. Initially the transaction price of the investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry-level multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include but are not limited to, recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets. For fund investments, we generally record the fair value of our proportionate interest in the fund s capital as reported by the fund s respective managers. 
  Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 
  Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance  ,   in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction. 
  In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating results for any given period. 

Table of Contents  

     Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts we estimate are more-likely-than-not to be realized. 
  While we have established some valuation allowances for certain state and non-U.S. deferred tax assets, we have concluded that our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction will be sufficient to realize all U.S. federal and U.K. deferred tax assets, including NOL and tax credit carryforwards, that are not subject to any special limitations (such as change-in-control limitations) prior to any expiration. Significant decreases to our estimate of future taxable income by jurisdiction could materially change our conclusions about how much of our tax attributes and other deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized prior to their expiration. See   Note 21   Income Taxes     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. 
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  Background 
  The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles   and   Note 10   Goodwill and Intangible Assets     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is performed as of June 30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill. 
  We use the reporting units  allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying amount of equity for each reporting unit in our goodwill impairment tests as we do not maintain a record of equity as defined under GAAP at the reporting unit level. Allocated equity includes economic capital, goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets allocated to the reporting units. The allocation of economic capital to the reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment testing has the same basis as the allocation of economic capital to our operating segments. Economic capital allocation plans are incorporated into the Corporation s financial plan which is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Allocated equity is updated on a quarterly basis. 
  The Corporation s common stock price remained volatile during 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the continued uncertainty in the economy and in the financial services industry, as well as adverse developments related to our mortgage business and increased regulation. During these periods, our market capitalization remained below our recorded book value. We estimate that the fair value of all reporting units in aggregate as of the June 30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test was $210.2 billion and the  

common stock market capitalization of the Corporation as of that date was   $111.1 billion   (  $58.6 billion   at   December 31, 2011  ). As none of our reporting units are publicly-traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations do not directly correlate to the Corporation s stock price. Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that recent fluctuations in our market capitalization reflect the fair value of our individual reporting units. 
  Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach, and included the use of independent valuation specialists. 
  The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, a control premium was added to arrive at the reporting units  estimated fair values on a controlling basis. 
  For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. We estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. 
  International Consumer Card Businesses 
  Of the $1.9 billion of goodwill associated with the international consumer card businesses, $526 million of goodwill was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, to the Canadian consumer card business which was sold on December 1, 2011. 
  During the three months ended   December 31, 2011  , a goodwill impairment test was performed for the European consumer card businesses reporting unit as it was likely that the carrying amount of the business exceeded the fair value due to a decrease in future growth projections. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of   $581 million   for the European consumer card businesses.

     Consumer Real Estate Services 
  In connection with the sale of Balboa on June 1, 2011, we allocated, on a relative fair value basis,   $193 million   of   CRES   goodwill to the business in determining the gain on the sale. 
  During the three months ended June 30, 2011, as a consequence of the BNY Mellon Settlement entered into by the Corporation on June 28, 2011, the adverse impact of the incremental mortgage-related charges and the continued economic slowdown in the mortgage business, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the   CRES   reporting unit. We concluded that the remaining balance of goodwill of   $2.6 billion   was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in   CRES   to zero. 
  2011 Annual Impairment Test  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2011, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2011 for all reporting units which had goodwill. In performing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying value, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premiums used in the June 30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 25 percent to 35 percent. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 11 percent to 16 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Growth rates developed by management for individual revenue and expense items in each reporting unit ranged from 0.7 percent to 6.7 percent. For certain revenue and expense items that have been significantly affected by the current economic environment and financial reform, management developed separate long-term forecasts.  
  Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment.  
  2010 Impairment Tests 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2010, we performed a goodwill impairment test for   Card Services   due to the continued stress on the business and the uncertain debit card interchange provisions under the Financial Reform Act. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of   $10.4 billion   to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in   Card Services  . 

During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the   CRES   reporting unit as it was likely that there was a decline in its fair value as a result of increased uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation exposure and other related risks, higher servicing costs including those related to loss mitigation, foreclosure related issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of   $2.0 billion   in   CRES  . 
  Representations and Warranties 
  The methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors. Depending upon the counterparty, these factors include actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that we will receive a repurchase request, including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default, estimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan and the experience with and the behavior of the counterparty. It also considers bulk settlements, as appropriate. The estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability. 
  The provision for representations and warranties may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances. The estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure has been disclosed. For the GSE claims where we have established a representations and warranties liability as discussed in   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  , an assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of   10   percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase of approximately   $850 million   or decrease of approximately   $800 million   in the representations and warranties liability as of   December 31, 2011  . Viewed from the perspective of home prices, for each one percent change in home prices, the liability for representations and warranties on unsettled GSE originations is estimated to be impacted by   $125 million   based on projected collateral losses and defect rates. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.

     For additional information on representations and warranties, see   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Representations and Warranties   on page   56  , as well as   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees   and   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Litigation Reserve 
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is both probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. 
  For a limited number of the matters disclosed in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, we are able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements  . For other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not possible. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, the estimated range of possible loss represents what we believe to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation s maximum loss exposure. Information is provided  

in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements   regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. 
  Consolidation and Accounting for Variable Interest Entities 
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, an entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
  Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires significant judgment. An entity must assess the purpose and design of the VIE, including explicit and implicit contractual arrangements, and the entity s involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing activities. The entity must then determine which activities have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the VIE and whether the entity has the power to direct such activities. For VIEs that hold financial assets, the party that services the assets or makes investment management decisions may have the power to direct the most significant activities of a VIE. Alternatively, a third party that has the unilateral right to replace the servicer or investment manager or to liquidate the VIE may be deemed to be the party with power. If there are no significant ongoing activities, the party that was responsible for the design of the VIE may be deemed to have power. If the entity determines that it has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, then the entity must determine if it has either an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such economic interests may include investments in debt or equity instruments issued by the VIE, liquidity commitments, and explicit and implicit guarantees. 
  On a quarterly basis, we reassess whether we have a controlling financial interest and are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.

     2010 Compared to 2009 
  The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for   2010   and   2009  . This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Tables   7   and   8   contain financial data to supplement this discussion. 
    Overview 
  Net Income/Loss 
  Net loss totaled   $2.2 billion   in   2010   compared to net income of   $6.3 billion   in   2009  . Including preferred stock dividends, the net loss applicable to common shareholders was   $3.6 billion  , or   $(0.37)   per diluted share. Those results compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of   $2.2 billion  , or   $(0.29)   per diluted share for   2009  . 
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion to   $52.7 billion   for   2010   compared to   2009  . The increase was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new consolidation guidance which contributed $10.5 billion to net interest income in 2010. The increase was partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels, the sale of First Republic in 2010 and lower rates on core assets and trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 13 bps to   2.78 percent   for   2010   compared to   2009   due to the factors described above. 
  Noninterest Income 
  Noninterest income decreased   $13.8 billion   to   $58.7 billion   in   2010   compared to   2009  . Card income decreased $245 million due to the implementation of the CARD Act partially offset by the impact of the new consolidation guidance and higher interchange income. Service charges decreased $1.6 billion largely due to the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E, which became effective in the third quarter of 2010 and the impact of our overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009. Equity investment income decreased $4.8 billion, as net gains on the sales of certain strategic investments during 2010   were less than gains in 2009 that included a $7.3 billion gain related to the sale of a portion of our investment in CCB. Trading account profits decreased $2.2 billion due to more favorable market conditions in 2009 and investor concerns regarding sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty. DVA gains, net of hedges, on derivative liabilities of $262 million for 2010 compared to losses of $662 million for 2009. Mortgage banking income decreased $6.1 billion due to an increase of $4.9 billion in representations and warranties provision and lower volume and margins. Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $2.2 billion driven by a lower volume of sales of debt securities. The decrease also included the impact of losses in 2010 related to portfolio restructuring activities. Other income (loss) improved by $2.4 billion. 2009 included a net negative fair value adjustment related to our own credit of $4.9 billion on structured liabilities compared to a net positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010, and 2009 also included a $3.8 billion gain on the contribution of our merchant services business to a joint venture. Legacy asset write-downs included in other income (loss) were $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to net gains of $256 million in 2010. Impairment losses recognized in earnings on AFS debt  

securities decreased $1.9 billion reflecting lower impairment write-downs on non-agency RMBS and CDOs. 
  Provision for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses decreased   $20.1 billion   to   $28.4 billion   for   2010   compared to   2009   due to improving portfolio trends across the consumer and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs totaled $34.3 billion, or 3.60 percent of average loans and leases for   2010   compared to $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent for   2009  . 
  Noninterest Expense 
  Noninterest expense increased   $16.4 billion   to   $83.1 billion   for   2010   compared to   2009   largely due to goodwill impairment charges of   $12.4 billion  . The increase was also driven by a $3.6 billion increase in personnel costs reflecting the build out of several businesses, the recognition of expense on proportionally larger 2009 incentive deferrals and the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments, as well as a $1.6 billion increase in litigation costs. These increases were partially offset by a $901 million decline in merger and restructuring charges compared to 2009. Noninterest expense for 2009 included a special FDIC assessment of $724 million.  
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense was   $915 million   for   2010   compared to a benefit of   $1.9 billion   for   2009  . The effective tax rate in   2010   was not meaningful due to the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges of   $12.4 billion  . The effective tax rate for   2010   excluding goodwill impairment charges was 8.3 percent compared to (44.0) percent in   2009  . The change in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income excluding the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. Also impacting the 2010 effective tax rate was a $392 million charge from a U.K. law change and a $1.7 billion tax benefit from the release of a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits compared to $650 million in 2009. 
    Business Segment Operations 
  Deposits 
  Net income decreased $1.3 billion to   $1.4 billion   in   2010   due to a decline in revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.1 billion to   $8.3 billion   as a result of a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline, partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Noninterest income decreased $1.8 billion to   $5.3 billion   driven by the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E, which was effective in the third quarter of   2010  , and our overdraft policy changes implemented in late   2009  . Noninterest expense increased $1.5 billion to   $11.2 billion   as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service costs was aligned to   Deposits   from the other segments, and increased litigation expenses partially offset by a decrease in FDIC expenses as   2009   included a special assessment. 

Table of Contents  

     Card Services 
  Card Services   recorded a net loss of   $7.0 billion   primarily due to a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Net interest income decreased $2.1 billion to   $14.4 billion   driven by a decrease in average loans and yields partially offset by lower funding costs. Noninterest income decreased $348 million to   $7.9 billion   driven by lower card income primarily due to the implementation of the CARD Act partially offset by higher interchange income during 2010 and the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position. The provision for credit losses improved $15.4 billion to   $11.0 billion   due to lower delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic environment, which resulted in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in 2010 compared to an increase in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $9.8 billion to   $16.4 billion   primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge. 
  Consumer Real Estate Services 
  CRES   net loss increased $5.1 billion to a net loss of   $8.9 billion   in   2010   primarily due to a $4.9 billion increase in representations and warranties provision and a $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a decline in the provision for credit losses driven by improving portfolio trends. Mortgage banking income declined driven by the increased representations and warranties provision and lower production volume reflecting a drop in the overall size of the mortgage market. The provision for credit losses decreased $2.8 billion to   $8.5 billion   driven by improving portfolio trends which led to lower reserve additions, including those associated with the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $3.4 billion to   $14.9 billion   due to the goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and an increase in default-related servicing expense, partially offset by lower production expense and insurance losses. 
  Global Commercial Banking 
  Net income increased $1.0 billion to   $3.2 billion   in   2010  . Net interest income remained relatively flat as growth in average deposits was offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Noninterest income decreased $4.2 billion to   $3.2 billion   largely due to the 2009 gain of $3.8 billion related to the contribution of the merchant services business into a joint venture. The provision for credit losses decreased $5.8 billion to   $2.0 billion   driven by improvements from stabilizing values in the commercial real estate portfolio and improved borrower credit profiles in the U.S. commercial portfolio.  
  Global Banking   Markets 
  Net income decreased $1.4 billion to   $6.3 billion   in   2010   driven by lower sales and trading revenue due to more favorable market conditions in 2009, partially offset by credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities and gains on legacy assets compared to losses  

in 2009. Sales and trading revenue was   $17.0 billion   in   2010   compared to $17.6 billion in   2009     due to increased investor risk aversion and more favorable market conditions in 2009  . Noninterest expense increased $2.3 billion to   $17.5 billion   driven by higher compensation costs as a result of the recognition of expense on a proportionally larger amount of prior year incentive deferrals and investments in infrastructure and personnel associated with further development of the business. Income tax expense was adversely affected by a charge related to the U.K. tax rate reduction impacting the carrying value of deferred tax assets. 
  Global Wealth   Investment Management 
  Net income decreased $329 million to   $1.3 billion   in   2010   driven by higher noninterest expense and the tax-related effect of the sale of the Columbia Management long-term asset management business partially offset by higher noninterest income and lower credit costs. Net interest income decreased $205 million to   $5.7 billion   as the positive impact of higher deposit levels was more than offset by lower revenue from corporate ALM activity. Noninterest income increased $708 million to   $10.6 billion   primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by stronger markets, continued long-term AUM flows and higher transactional activity. The provision for credit losses decreased $414 million to   $646 million   driven by improving portfolio trends and the recognition of a single large commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion to   $13.2 billion   due primarily to higher revenue-related expenses, support costs and personnel costs associated with further investment in the business. 
  All Other 
  Net income increased $293 million to   $1.5 billion   in   2010  . Net interest income decreased $1.9 billion to   $3.7 billion   driven by a $1.4 billion lower funding differential on certain securitizations and the impact of capital raises occurring throughout 2009 that were not allocated to the businesses. Noninterest income decreased $5.7 billion to   $6.0 billion   as the prior year included a $7.3 billion gain resulting from a sale of shares of CCB and an increase of $1.4 billion on net gains on the sale of debt securities. This was offset by net negative fair value adjustments related to our own credit of $4.9 billion on structured liabilities in 2009 compared to a net positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010 and higher valuation adjustments and gains on sales of select investments in GPI. Also, in 2010, we sold our investments in Ita  Unibanco and Santander   resulting in a net gain of approximately $800 million, as well as the gains on CCB and BlackRock.   The provision for credit losses decreased $4.9 billion to   $6.3 billion   due to improving portfolio trends in the residential mortgage portfolio partially offset by further deterioration in the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate portfolio.

   Glossary 
    Alt-A Mortgage       A type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or  prime,  and less risky than  subprime,  the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. 
  Assets in Custody     Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. 
  Assets Under Management (AUM)       The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of   GWIM   which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets  market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net-worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. 
  Carrying Value (with respect to loans)       The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value. 
  Client Brokerage Assets       Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. 
  Committed Credit Exposure       Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. 
  Core Net Interest Income       Net interest income on a FTE basis excluding the impact of market-based activities. 
  Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act)       Legislation signed into law on May 22, 2009 that changes credit card industry practices including significantly restricting credit card issuers  ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, changes the way payments are applied and changes consumer credit card  

disclosures. The majority of the provisions became effective on February 22, 2010, while certain provisions became effective in the third quarter of 2010. 
  Credit Derivatives     Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A credit default swap is a type of a credit derivative.  
  Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC)       Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. 
  Letter of Credit       A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer s credit for that of the customer. 
  Loan-to-value (LTV)       A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional metric related to LTV is     combined loan-to-value (CLTV)     which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances, estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk Assessment Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag. 
  Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR)     The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. 

Table of Contents  

     Net Interest Yield       Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. 
  Nonperforming Loans and Leases       Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans not secured by real estate, and consumer loans secured by real estate, which include loans insured by the FHA and individually insured long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio), are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. 
  Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan       A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition. 
  Subprime Loans       Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. 
  Super Senior CDO Exposure         Represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated securities, issued by CDO vehicles. 

Tier 1 Common Capital     Tier 1 capital including any CES, less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. 
  Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)       Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming TDRs may be returned to accrual status when, among other criteria, payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is expected and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance, typically six months. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs. 
  Value-at-Risk (VaR)       VaR represents the worst loss a portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence, and depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios and is a key statistic used to measure and manage market risk.

     Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  The management of Bank of America Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
  The Corporation s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Corporation s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2011   based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework  . Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework  . 
  The Corporation s internal control over financial reporting               as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2011  .

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bank of America Corporation: 
  In our opinion, the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders  Equity and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2011   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2011  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporation s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an  

understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
      NOTE 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles 
  Bank of America Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Corporation), a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term  the Corporation  as used herein may refer to the Corporation individually, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of the Corporation s subsidiaries or affiliates. 
  The Corporation conducts its activities through banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The Corporation operates its banking activities primarily under two charters: Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) and FIA Card Services, National Association (FIA Card Services, N.A.). 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting or at fair value under the fair value option. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing and the Corporation s proportionate share of income or loss is included in equity investment income. 
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Realized results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
  The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), including criteria to determine whether a loan modification represents a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. This new accounting guidance was effective for the Corporation as of September 30, 2011 with retrospective application back to January 1, 2011. As a result of the  

retrospective application, the Corporation classified   $1.1 billion   of commercial loan modifications as TDRs that in previous periods had not been classified as TDRs. These loans were newly identified as TDRs typically because the Corporation was not able to demonstrate that the modified rate of interest, although significantly higher than the rate prior to modification, was a market rate of interest. These loans include   $402 million   of performing commercial loans that had an aggregate allowance for credit losses of   $27 million   at   December 31, 2011  . Also, as a result of the new accounting guidance, loans that are participating in or that have been offered a binding trial modification are classified as TDRs. At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation classified an additional   $2.6 billion   of home loans, with an aggregate allowance for credit losses of   $154 million  , as TDRs that were participating in or had been offered a trial modification. 
  In April 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that addresses effective control in repurchase agreements and eliminates the requirement for entities to consider whether the transferor/seller has the ability to repurchase the financial assets in a repurchase agreement. This new accounting guidance was effective, on a prospective basis, for new transactions or modifications to existing transactions on January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Corporation s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In May 2011, the FASB issued amendments to the fair value accounting guidance. The amendments clarify the application of the highest and best use, and valuation premise concepts, preclude the application of blockage factors in the valuation of all financial instruments and include criteria for applying the fair value measurement principles to portfolios of financial instruments. The amendments additionally prescribe enhanced financial statement disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements. The new amendments were effective on January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Corporation s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In June 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements. The new guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements. This new accounting guidance is effective for the Corporation for the three months ended March 31, 2012.  
  In September 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing. The new guidance permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, under this assessment, it is likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, an entity is required to perform the two-step impairment test. The Corporation early adopted the new accounting guidance for certain goodwill impairment tests during the three months ended September 30, 2011. 

Table of Contents  

     In December 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures on financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with existing accounting guidance or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The new requirements do not change the accounting guidance on netting, but rather enhance the disclosures to more clearly show the impact of netting arrangements on a company s financial position. This new accounting guidance will be effective, on a retrospective basis for all comparative periods presented, beginning on January 1, 2013. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent banks and the Federal Reserve Bank. 
  Securities Financing Agreements 
  Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions. These agreements are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest, except for certain securities financing agreements that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of securities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option are recorded in other income. For more information on securities financing agreements that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, see   Note 23   Fair Value Option  . 
  The Corporation s policy is to obtain possession of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements. To ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily and the Corporation may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or may return collateral pledged when appropriate. Securities financing agreements give rise to negligible credit risk as a result of these collateral provisions, and accordingly, no allowance for loan losses is considered necessary. 
  Substantially all repurchase and resale activities are transacted under legally enforceable master repurchase agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets repurchase and resale transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date. 
  In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability for the same amount, representing the obligation to return those securities. 
  In repurchase transactions, typically, the termination date for a repurchase agreement is before the maturity date of the underlying security. However, in certain situations, the Corporation may enter into repurchase agreements where the termination date of the repurchase transaction is the same as the maturity date of the underlying security and these transactions are referred to as  

repo-to-maturity  (RTM) transactions. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation accounts for RTM transactions as sales and purchases when the transferred securities are highly liquid. In instances where securities are considered sold or purchased, the Corporation removes or recognizes the securities from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and, in the case of sales recognizes a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation had no outstanding RTM transactions that had been accounted for as sales and an immaterial amount of transactions that had been accounted for as purchases. 
  Collateral 
  The Corporation accepts securities as collateral that it is permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the fair value of this collateral was   $393.9 billion   and   $401.7 billion   of which   $287.7 billion   and   $257.6 billion   was sold or repledged. The primary sources of this collateral are repurchase agreements and securities borrowed. The Corporation also pledges firm-owned securities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and other short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  In certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Assets of Consolidated VIEs. 
  In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on provisions contained in legal netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral against the applicable derivative fair value. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative liabilities. 
  Trading Instruments 
  Financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in trading account profits (losses). 
  Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
  Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading, as economic hedges or as qualifying accounting hedges. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, financial futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. Financial futures and forward settlement  

Table of Contents  

     contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument, index, currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys to the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument (including another derivative financial instrument), index, currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a date in the future. Option agreements can be transacted on organized exchanges or directly between parties. 
  All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. 
  Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Corporation s own credit standing, thus including in the valuation of the derivative instrument the value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract. 
  Trading Derivatives and Economic Hedges 
  Derivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities with changes in fair value included in trading account profits (losses). 
  Derivatives used as economic hedges, because either they did not qualify for or were not designated as an accounting hedge, are also included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve as economic hedges of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in mortgage banking income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve as economic hedges of credit exposures, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures are included in other income (loss). Credit derivatives used by the Corporation as economic hedges do not qualify as accounting hedges but can protect the Corporation from various credit exposures as economic hedges, and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other income (loss). 
  Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) 
  For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in a hedging transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship. 

The Corporation uses its accounting hedges as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the Corporation s assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange fluctuations. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately   25   years, with a substantial portion of the hedged transactions being less than   10   years. For open or future cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are or will be hedged is less than   seven   years. 
  Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded and in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on the excluded component of a derivative in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in earnings in the same income statement line item. The Corporation records changes in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net investment in foreign operations, to the extent effective, as a component of accumulated OCI. 
  If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability. If a derivative instrument in a cash flow hedge is terminated or the hedge designation is removed, related amounts in accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. If it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, any related amounts in accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings in that period. 
  Interest Rate Lock Commitments 
  The Corporation enters into IRLCs in connection with its mortgage banking activities to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the future. IRLCs that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held-for-sale are considered derivative instruments under applicable accounting guidance. As such, these IRLCs are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income. 
  In estimating the fair value of an IRLC, the Corporation assigns a probability to the loan commitment based on an expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded. The fair value of the commitments is derived from the fair value of related mortgage loans which is based on observable market data and includes the expected net future cash flows related to servicing of the loans. Changes to the fair value of IRLCs are recognized based on interest rate changes, changes in the probability that the commitment will  

Table of Contents  

     be exercised and the passage of time. Changes from the expected future cash flows related to the customer relationship are excluded from the valuation of IRLCs. 
  Outstanding IRLCs expose the Corporation to the risk that the price of the loans underlying the commitments might decline from inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan. To protect against this risk, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sales commitments and other derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and options, to economically hedge the risk of potential changes in the value of the loans that would result from the commitments. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in mortgage banking income. 
  Securities 
  Debt securities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of their trade date. Debt securities bought principally with the intent to buy and sell in the short term as part of the Corporation s trading activities are reported at fair value in trading account assets with unrealized gains and losses included in trading account profits (losses). Debt securities purchased for longer term investment purposes, as part of asset and liability management (ALM) and other strategic activities, are reported at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated OCI and presented as available-for-sale (AFS) securities. Certain debt securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity (HTM) are reported at amortized cost and presented as HTM securities. Other debt securities purchased as economic hedges are reported in other assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in the same line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income as unrealized gains and losses on the item being hedged are reported. 
  The Corporation regularly evaluates each AFS and HTM debt security where the value has declined below amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. In determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Corporation considers the severity and duration of the decline in fair value, the length of time expected for recovery, the financial condition of the issuer, and other qualitative factors, as well as whether the Corporation either plans to sell the security or it is more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. If the impairment of the AFS or HTM debt security is credit-related, an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) is recorded in earnings. For AFS debt securities, the non-credit-related impairment is recognized in accumulated OCI. If the Corporation intends to sell an AFS debt security or believes it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell a security, the Corporation records the full amount of the impairment as an OTTI. 
  Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities, which are included in gains (losses) on sales of debt securities, are determined using the specific identification method. 
  Marketable equity securities are classified based on management s intention on the date of purchase and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the trade date. Marketable equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of resale in the near term are classified as trading and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in trading account profits (losses). Other marketable equity securities are accounted for as AFS and classified in other assets. All AFS marketable equity securities are carried at fair value with  

net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. If there is an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of any individual AFS marketable equity security, the cost basis is reduced and the Corporation reclassifies the associated net unrealized loss out of accumulated OCI with a corresponding charge to equity investment income. Dividend income on AFS marketable equity securities is included in equity investment income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of all AFS marketable equity securities, which are recorded in equity investment income, are determined using the specific identification method. 
  Certain equity investments held by Global Principal Investments (GPI), the Corporation s diversified equity investor in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments, are subject to investment company accounting under applicable accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in equity investment income. These investments are included in other assets. Initially, the transaction price of the investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry level multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include but are not limited to recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets. For fund investments, the Corporation generally records the fair value of its proportionate interest in the fund s capital as reported by the funds  respective managers. 
  Other investments held by GPI are accounted for under either the equity method or at cost, depending on the Corporation s ownership interest, and are reported in other assets. 
  Loans and Leases 
  Loans measured at historical cost are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain loans under the fair value option with changes in fair value reported in other income for consumer and commercial loans. 
  Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivables. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivables is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation s three portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial. The classes within the home loans  

Table of Contents  

     portfolio segment are core portfolio residential mortgage, Legacy Asset Servicing residential mortgage, Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) residential mortgage purchased credit-impaired (PCI), core portfolio home equity, Legacy Asset Servicing home equity, Countrywide home equity PCI, Legacy Asset Servicing discontinued real estate and Countrywide discontinued real estate PCI  .   The classes within the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment are U.S. credit card, non-U.S. credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within the commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing, non-U.S. commercial and U.S. small business commercial. 
  Purchased Credit-impaired Loans 
  The Corporation purchases loans with and without evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed borrower credit scores and refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, some of which are not immediately available as of the purchase date. Purchased loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration for which it is probable that the Corporation will not receive all contractually required payments receivable are accounted for as PCI loans. The excess of the cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans, measured as of the acquisition date, over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan using a level yield methodology. The difference between contractually required payments as of the acquisition date and the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. PCI loans that have similar risk characteristics, primarily credit risk, collateral type and interest rate risk, are pooled and accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.  
  The Corporation continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loan using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and payment speeds. If, upon subsequent evaluation, the Corporation determines it is probable that the present value of the expected cash flows have decreased, the PCI loan is considered further impaired resulting in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to a valuation allowance included in the allowance for loan and lease losses. If, upon subsequent evaluation, it is probable that there is an increase in the present value of the expected cash flows, the Corporation reduces any remaining valuation allowance. If there is no remaining valuation allowance, the Corporation recalculates the amount of accretable yield as the excess of the revised expected cash flows over the current carrying value resulting in a reclassification from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield. The present value of the expected cash flows is determined using the PCI loans  effective interest rate, adjusted for changes in the PCI loans  interest rate indexes.  
  Loan disposals, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full from the borrower or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan pool. Write-downs are not recorded on the PCI loan pool until actual losses exceed the remaining nonaccretable difference. To date, no write-downs have been recorded for any of the PCI loan pools. 

Leases 
  The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are carried net of nonrecourse debt. Unearned income on leveraged and direct financing leases is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method. 
  Allowance for Credit Losses 
  The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation s lending activities. The allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments exclude amounts for loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option as the fair values of these instruments reflect a credit component. The allowance for loan and lease losses does not include amounts related to accrued interest receivable other than billed interest and fees on credit card receivables as accrued interest receivable is reversed when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents the estimated probable credit losses on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, represents estimated probable credit losses on these unfunded credit instruments based on utilization assumptions. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible, excluding derivative assets, trading account assets and loans carried at fair value, are charged against these accounts. Cash recovered on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to these accounts. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses based on the combined total of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. 
  The Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The allowance on certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which generally consist of consumer real estate within the home loans portfolio segment and credit card loans within the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment, is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized for these portfolios which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic conditions and credit scores. 
  The Corporation s home loans portfolio segment is comprised primarily of large groups of homogeneous consumer loans secured by residential real estate. The amount of losses incurred in the homogeneous loan pools is estimated based upon how many of the loans will default and the loss in the event of default. Using statistically valid modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates how many of the homogeneous loans will default based on the individual loans  attributes aggregated into pools of homogeneous loans with similar attributes. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of default and are used to  

Table of Contents  

     estimate default include refreshed LTV or in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination (referred to as vintage) and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). This estimate is based on the Corporation s historical experience with the loan portfolio. The estimate is adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data underlying the loss estimates, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default on a loan is based on an analysis of the movement of loans with the measured attributes from either current, or any of the delinquency categories, to default over a twelve-month period. On home equity loans where the Corporation holds only a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the best alternative, the loss severity is estimated at   100   percent. 
  The allowance on certain commercial loans (except business card and certain small business loans) is calculated using loss rates delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered when assessing loss rates include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the obligor s liquidity and other financial indicators along with certain qualitative factors. These statistical models are updated regularly for changes in economic and business conditions. Included in the analysis of consumer and commercial loan portfolios are reserves which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect the Corporation s estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty and large single name defaults. 
  The remaining commercial portfolios, including nonperforming commercial loans, as well as consumer real estate loans modified in a TDR, renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business loans are reviewed in accordance with applicable accounting guidance on impaired loans and TDRs. If necessary, a specific allowance is established for these loans if they are deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and/or interest, according to the contractual terms of the agreement, and once a loan has been identified as impaired, management measures impairment. Impaired loans and TDRs are primarily measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loans  original effective contractual interest rates, or discounted at the portfolio average contractual annual percentage rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring for the renegotiated TDR portfolio. Impaired loans and TDRs may also be measured based on observable market prices, or for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. If the recorded investment in impaired loans exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is established as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses unless these are consumer real estate loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, in which case the initial amount that exceeds the fair value of the collateral is charged off. 
  Generally, when determining the fair value of the collateral securing consumer loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, prior to performing a detailed property valuation including a walk-through of a property, the Corporation initially estimates the fair value of the collateral securing consumer loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment  

using an automated valuation method (AVM). An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of the portfolio in the aggregate. 
  In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments excludes commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to the Corporation s internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, utilization assumptions, current economic conditions, performance trends within the portfolio and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. 
  The allowance for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio is reported separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet whereas the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
  Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies 
  Nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. 
  In accordance with the Corporation s policies, credit card loans where the borrower is not deceased or in bankruptcy and unsecured consumer loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes   180   days past due. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes   180   days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). The estimated property value, less estimated costs to sell, is determined using the same process as described for impaired loans in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this Note on page   162  . Personal property-secured loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes   120   days past due. Unsecured accounts associated with borrowers who became deceased or are in bankruptcy, including credit cards, are charged off   60   days after receipt of notification. For secured products, accounts in bankruptcy are written down to  

Table of Contents  

     the collateral value, less costs to sell, by the end of the month in which the account becomes   60   days past due. Consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property and unsecured consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and therefore are not reported as nonperforming loans. Real estate-secured loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at   90   days past due. However, consumer loans secured by real estate in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status, and therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when a consumer loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing consumer loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to interest income when received. These loans may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. 
  Consumer loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally   six   months. Consumer TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which the loans are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing consumer TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs. 
  Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due   90   days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection. Commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming until the loans have performed for an adequate period of time under the restructured agreement, generally   six   months. If the borrower had demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the modified terms, the loans and leases may remain on accrual status. Accruing commercial TDRs are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the loans are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing commercial TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs. 
  Accrued interest receivable is reversed when a commercial loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing  

commercial loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Commercial loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. Business card loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes   180   days past due or   60   days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy filing. These loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and therefore are not reported as nonperforming loans. Other commercial loans are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible. 
  The entire balance of a consumer and commercial loan is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer s billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan goes into nonaccrual status, if applicable. 
  PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. Although the PCI loans may be contractually delinquent, the Corporation does not classify these loans as nonperforming as the loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date and the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan. In addition, reported net charge-offs exclude write-downs on PCI loan pools as the fair value already considers the estimated credit losses. 
  Loans Held-for-sale 
  Loans that are intended to be sold in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including first mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Mortgage loan origination costs related to LHFS that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. Mortgage loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income upon the sale of such loans. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy above, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases. 
  Premises and Equipment 
  Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to   40   years for buildings, up to   12   years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. 
  The Corporation capitalizes the costs associated with certain computer hardware, software and internally developed software, and amortizes the costs over the expected useful life. Direct project costs of internally developed software are capitalized when it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for its intended function.

     Mortgage Servicing Rights 
  The Corporation accounts for consumer-related MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income, while commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method (lower of amortized cost or fair value) with impairment recognized as a reduction in mortgage banking income. To reduce the volatility of earnings related to interest rate and market value fluctuations, U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These economic hedges are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income. 
  The Corporation estimates the fair value of the consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. This is accomplished through an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach that factors in prepayment risk. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. The key economic assumptions used in valuations of MSRs include weighted-average lives of the MSRs and the OAS levels. The OAS represents the spread that is added to the discount rate so that the sum of the discounted cash flows equals the market price, therefore it is a measure of the extra yield over the reference discount factor that the Corporation expects to earn by holding the asset. These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change, and could have an adverse impact on the value of the MSRs and could result in a corresponding reduction in mortgage banking income. 
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business segment or one level below a business segment. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. During 2011, the Corporation early adopted new accounting guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by permitting entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For additional information, see New Accounting Pronouncements in this Note on page   158  . The first step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to measure potential impairment. 
  The second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated possible impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business  

combination. Measurement of the fair values of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit is consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting guidance, which defines fair value as an exit price, meaning the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The adjustments to measure the assets, liabilities and intangibles at fair value are for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance. 
  For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses whether it has a controlling financial interest in and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly reassessment process considers whether the Corporation has acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether the Corporation has acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements. 
  The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation. Assets held in a trust can only be used to settle obligations of the trust. The creditors of these trusts typically have no recourse to the Corporation except in accordance with the Corporation s obligations under standard representations and warranties. 

Table of Contents  

     When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, automobile loans and student loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust unless the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust. 
  The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights. 
  Other VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage the assets of the CDO, the Corporation consolidates the CDO. 
  The Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle. 
  Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Quoted market prices are primarily used to obtain fair values of these debt securities, which are AFS debt securities or trading account assets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not available, therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows. This may require management to estimate credit losses, prepayment speeds, forward interest yield curves, discount rates and other factors that impact the value of retained interests. Retained residual interests in unconsolidated securitization trusts  

are classified in trading account assets or other assets with changes in fair value recorded in income. The Corporation may also enter into derivatives with unconsolidated VIEs, which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income. 
  Fair Value 
  The Corporation measures the fair values of its financial instruments in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price, and maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price. Under applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation categorizes its financial instruments, based on the priority of inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level hierarchy, as described below. Trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, MSRs and certain other assets are carried at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The Corporation has also elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option, including certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS, other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt. The following describes the three-level hierarchy. 
    
           Level 1 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. 
              Level 2 
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, residential mortgage loans and certain LHFS. 
              Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, market comparables, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. This category generally includes certain private equity investments and other principal investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential MSRs, asset-backed securities (ABS), highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain LHFS, IRLCs and certain  

Table of Contents  

     CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets. 
  Income Taxes 
  There are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more-likely-than-not to be realized. 
  Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step model: 1) a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and 2) the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit (UTB). The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense. 
  Retirement Benefits 
  The Corporation has established retirement plans covering substantially all full-time and certain part-time employees. Pension expense under these plans is charged to current operations and consists of several components of net pension cost based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future experience under the plans. 
  In addition, the Corporation has established unfunded supplemental benefit plans and supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) for selected officers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries that provide benefits that cannot be paid from a qualified retirement plan due to Internal Revenue Code restrictions. The Corporation s current executive officers do not earn additional retirement income under SERPs. These plans are nonqualified under the Internal Revenue Code and assets used to fund benefit payments are not segregated from other assets of the Corporation; therefore, in general, a participant s or beneficiary s claim to benefits under these plans is as a general creditor. In addition, the Corporation has established several postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
  The Corporation records unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities, gains and losses on cash flow accounting hedges, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, transition obligation and prior service costs on pension and postretirement plans, foreign currency translation adjustments and related hedges of net investments in foreign operations in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities are reclassified to earnings as the gains or losses are realized upon sale of the securities. Unrealized losses on AFS securities deemed to represent OTTI are  

reclassified to earnings at the time of the impairment charge. For AFS debt securities that the Corporation does not intend to sell or it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell, only the credit component of an unrealized loss is reclassified to earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Translation gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to earnings upon the substantial sale or liquidation of investments in foreign operations. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The following summarizes the Corporation s revenue recognition policies as they relate to certain noninterest income line items in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
  Card income is derived from fees such as interchange, cash advance, annual, late, over-limit and other miscellaneous fees, which are recorded as revenue when earned, primarily on an accrual basis. Uncollected fees are included in the customer card receivables balances with an amount recorded in the allowance for loan and lease losses for estimated uncollectible card receivables. Uncollected fees are written off when a card receivable reaches   180   days past due. 
  Service charges include fees for insufficient funds, overdrafts and other banking services and are recorded as revenue when earned. Uncollected fees are included in outstanding loan balances with an amount recorded for estimated uncollectible service fees receivable. Uncollected fees are written off when a fee receivable reaches   60   days past due. 
  Investment and brokerage services revenue consists primarily of asset management fees and brokerage income that is recognized over the period the services are provided or when commissions are earned. Asset management fees consist primarily of fees for investment management and trust services and are generally based on the dollar amount of the assets being managed. Brokerage income is generally derived from commissions and fees earned on the sale of various financial products. 
  Investment banking income consists primarily of advisory and underwriting fees that are recognized in income as the services are provided and no contingencies exist. Revenues are generally recognized net of any direct expenses. Non-reimbursed expenses are recorded as noninterest expense. 
  Earnings Per Common Share 
  Earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss) allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding, except that it does not include unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income (loss) allocated to common shareholders represents net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders which is net income (loss) adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities (see below for additional information). Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income (loss) allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants by the weighted-average  

Table of Contents  

     common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable. Certain warrants may be exercised, at the option of the holder, through tendering of the Corporation s 6% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series T (the Series T Preferred Stock) or cash. Because it is currently more economical for the warrant holder to tender the Series T preferred stock, the common shares underlying these warrants are considered outstanding and the dividends on the preferred stock are added back to income (loss) allocable to common shareholders in computing diluted EPS, unless the effect is antidilutive. 
  Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities that are included in computing EPS using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula under which EPS is calculated for common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings. Under this method, all earnings, distributed and undistributed, are allocated to participating securities and common shares based on their respective rights to receive dividends. 
  In an exchange of non-convertible preferred stock, income allocated to common shareholders is adjusted for the difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock and the fair value of the consideration exchanged. In an induced conversion of convertible preferred stock, income allocated to common shareholders is reduced by the excess of the fair value of the consideration exchanged over the fair value of the common stock that would have been issued under the original conversion terms. 
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. For certain of the foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency, in which case the assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting unrealized gains or losses as well as gains and losses from certain hedges, are reported as a component of accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. When the foreign entity s functional currency is determined to be the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement currency gains or losses on  

foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings. 
  Credit Card and Deposit Arrangements 
  Endorsing Organization Agreements 
  The Corporation contracts with other organizations to obtain their endorsement of the Corporation s loan and deposit products. This endorsement may provide to the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the organization s members or to customers on behalf of the Corporation. These organizations endorse the Corporation s loan and deposit products and provide the Corporation with their mailing lists and marketing activities. These agreements generally have terms that range from   two   to   five   years. The Corporation typically pays royalties in exchange for the endorsement. Compensation costs related to the credit card agreements are recorded as contra-revenue in card income. 
  Cardholder Reward Agreements 
  The Corporation offers reward programs that allow its cardholders to earn points that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and discounted products. The Corporation establishes a rewards liability based upon the points earned that are expected to be redeemed and the average cost per point redeemed. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The estimated cost of the rewards programs is recorded as contra-revenue in card income. 
  Insurance Income and Insurance Expense 
  Property and casualty and credit life and disability premiums are generally recognized over the term of the policies on a pro-rata basis for all policies except for certain of the lender-placed auto insurance and the guaranteed auto protection (GAP) policies. For lender-placed auto insurance, premiums are recognized when collections become probable due to high cancellation rates experienced early in the life of the policy. For GAP insurance, revenue recognition is correlated to the exposure and accelerated over the life of the contract. Mortgage reinsurance premiums are recognized as earned. Insurance expense includes insurance claims, commissions and premium taxes, all of which are recorded in other general operating expense.

     NOTE 2   Merger and Restructuring Activity 
  Merger and restructuring charges are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income and include incremental costs to integrate the operations of the Corporation and its most recent acquisitions. These charges represent costs associated with these activities and do not represent ongoing costs of the fully integrated combined organization. The merger and restructuring charges table presents the components of merger and restructuring charges.  

For   2011  , all merger-related charges related to the Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) acquisition. Included for   2010   and   2009   are merger-related charges of   $1.6 billion   and   $1.8 billion   related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition and   $202 million   and   $940 million   related to earlier acquisitions. 

The restructuring reserves table presents the changes in restructuring reserves for   2011   and   2010  . Restructuring reserves are established by a charge to merger and restructuring charges, and the restructuring charges are included in the merger and restructuring charges table. Substantially all of the amounts in the restructuring reserves table relate to the Merrill Lynch acquisition. 

Amounts added to the restructuring reserves in   2011   and   2010   related to severance and other employee-related costs. Payments associated with the Merrill Lynch acquisition are anticipated to continue into 2012. 

NOTE 3   Trading Account Assets and Liabilities 
  The table below presents the components of trading account assets and liabilities at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  .

   NOTE 4   Derivatives 
  Derivative Balances 
    Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading, as economic hedges or as qualifying accounting hedges. For additional information on the Corporation s derivatives and hedging activities, see   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles  . The following tables identify derivative instruments included on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet in  

derivative assets and liabilities at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and collateral netting. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by the cash collateral applied.

    Excludes   $4.1 billion   of long-term debt designated as a hedge of foreign currency risk. 
       ALM and Risk Management Derivatives 
  The Corporation s ALM and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated as qualifying accounting hedges and economic hedges. Interest rate, commodity, credit and foreign exchange contracts are utilized in the Corporation s ALM and risk management activities.  
  The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
  Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market  

conditions such as interest rate movements. To hedge interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and Eurodollar futures as economic hedges of the fair value of MSRs. For additional information on MSRs, see   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights  . 
  The Corporation uses foreign currency contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.  
  The Corporation enters into derivative commodity contracts such as futures, swaps, options and forwards as well as non-derivative commodity contracts to provide price risk management services to customers or to manage price risk associated with its physical and financial commodity positions. The non-derivative  

Table of Contents  

     commodity contracts and physical inventories of commodities expose the Corporation to earnings volatility. Cash flow and fair value accounting hedges provide a method to mitigate a portion of this earnings volatility.  
  The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are accounted for as economic hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in other income (loss). 
  Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges 
  The Corporation uses various types of interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to  

fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts and equity derivatives to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts, cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges). 
  Fair Value Hedges 
  The table below summarizes certain information related to the Corporation s derivatives designated as fair value hedges for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  . 

(1)   
    Amounts are recorded in interest expense on long-term debt and in other income.

               (3)   
    Amounts are recorded in trading account profits. 

Table of Contents  

     Cash Flow Hedges 
  The table below summarizes certain information related to the Corporation s derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  . During the next 12 months, net losses in accumulated OCI of approximately   $1.5 billion   (  $1.0 billion   after-tax) on derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net interest income related to the respective hedged items. Amounts related to commodity price risk reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in trading account  

profits with the underlying hedged item. Amounts related to price risk on restricted stock awards reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in personnel expense. Amounts related to price risk on equity investments included in AFS securities reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in equity investment income with the underlying hedged item.  
  Amounts related to foreign exchange risk recognized in accumulated OCI on derivatives exclude gains (losses) of   $82 million  ,   $192 million   and   $(387) million   related to long-term debt designated as a net investment hedge for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  . 

(1)   
    Amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges represent hedge ineffectiveness and amounts related to net investment hedges represent amounts excluded from effectiveness testing. 
               (2)   
    Losses reclassified from accumulated OCI to the Consolidated Statement of Income include   $38 million  ,   $0   and   $44 million   in   2011  ,   2010   and   2009   related to the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges because it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction would occur. 
       
    The Corporation entered into equity total return swaps to hedge a portion of RSUs granted to certain employees as part of their compensation in prior periods. Certain awards contain clawback provisions which permit the Corporation to cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances, and certain awards may be settled in cash. These RSUs are accrued as liabilities over the vesting period and adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation s common stock. From time to time, the Corporation may enter into equity derivatives to minimize the change in the expense to the Corporation driven by fluctuations  

in the share price of the Corporation s common stock during the vesting period of any RSUs that may be granted, if any, subject to similar or other terms and conditions. Certain of these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of unrecognized unvested awards with the changes in fair value of the hedge recorded in accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period as the RSUs affect earnings. The remaining derivatives are accounted for as economic hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in personnel expense. For more information on RSUs and related hedges, see     Note 20   Stock-based Compensation Plans  .

   Derivatives Accounted for as Economic Hedges 
  Derivatives accounted for as economic hedges, because either they did not qualify for or were not designated as accounting hedges, are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  . These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense that is recorded on the economically hedged item. 

(1)   
    Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in mortgage banking income. 
               (2)   
    Includes gains on interest rate lock commitments related to the origination of mortgage loans that are held-for-sale, which are considered derivative instruments, of   $3.8 billion  ,   $8.7 billion   and   $8.4 billion   for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , respectively. 
               (3)   
    Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in other income (loss). 
               (4)   
    The majority of the balance is related to the revaluation of economic hedges on foreign currency-denominated debt which is recorded in other income (loss). 
               (5)   
    Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in other income (loss), and personnel expense for hedges of certain RSUs, for   2011   and   2010  . 
       Sales and Trading Revenue 
  The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions, for principal trading purposes, and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation s   Global Banking   Markets   (  GBAM  ) business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within   GBAM   is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories. However, the majority of income related to derivative instruments is recorded in trading account profits.  
  Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity  

securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in other income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker/dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, all revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which includes exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income (loss). 
  Gains (losses) on certain instruments, primarily loans, held in the   GBAM   business segment that are not considered trading instruments are excluded from sales and trading revenue in their entirety. 

Table of Contents  

   The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation s sales and trading revenue in   GBAM  , categorized by primary risk, for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  . The difference between total trading account profits in the table below and in the Consolidated Statement of Income relates to trading activities in business segments other than   GBAM  . 

(1)   
    Represents investment and brokerage services and other income recorded in   GBAM   that the Corporation includes in its definition of sales and trading revenue. 
        Credit Derivatives 
  The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a pre-defined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of  

the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount. 

Table of Contents  

   Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   are summarized in the table below. These instruments are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. 

(1)   
    For credit-related notes, maximum payout/notional is the same as carrying value. 
               (2)   
    For   December 31, 2010  , total credit-related note amounts have been revised from   $3.6 billion   (as previously reported) to   $6.3 billion   to reflect collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations held by certain consolidated VIEs. 

Table of Contents  

     The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not solely monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based on notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits to help ensure that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, pre-defined limits. 
  The Corporation economically hedges its market risk exposure to credit derivatives by entering into a variety of offsetting derivative contracts and security positions. For example, in certain instances, the Corporation may purchase credit protection with identical underlying referenced names to offset its exposure. The carrying value and notional amount of written credit derivatives for which the Corporation held purchased credit derivatives with identical underlying referenced names and terms at   December 31, 2011   was   $48.0 billion   and   $1.0 trillion   compared to   $43.7 billion   and   $1.4 trillion   at   December 31, 2010  . 
  Credit-related notes in the table on page   176   include investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments. 
  Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral 
  The Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. Substantially all of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page   170  , the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.  
  A majority of the Corporation s derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features, primarily in the form of International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of   $87.7 billion   and   $86.1 billion  , and posted cash and securities collateral of   $86.5 billion   and   $66.9 billion   in the normal course of business under derivative agreements. 

In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.  
  At   December 31, 2011  , the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was approximately   $5.0 billion  . That amount includes collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the downgrades by the rating agencies in 2011.  
  Some counterparties are able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At   December 31, 2011  , the current liability recorded for these derivative contracts was   $947 million  , against which the Corporation and certain subsidiaries had posted   $1.0 billion   of collateral. 
  In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of a further downgrade of the Corporation s or certain subsidiaries  credit ratings, counterparties to those agreements may require the Corporation or certain subsidiaries to provide additional collateral, terminate these contracts or agreements, or provide other remedies. At   December 31, 2011  , if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements would have been approximately   $1.6 billion   comprised of   $1.2 billion   for BANA and approximately   $375 million   for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries. If the agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for these entities by a second incremental notch, approximately   $1.1 billion   in additional collateral comprised of   $871 million   for BANA and   $269 million   for Merrill Lynch and certain subsidiaries, would have been required. 
  Also, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of   December 31, 2011   was   $2.9 billion  , against which   $2.7 billion   of collateral has been posted. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation and certain subsidiaries by a second incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of   December 31, 2011   was an incremental   $5.6 billion  , against which   $5.4 billion   of collateral has been posted. 
  Derivative Valuation Adjustments 
  The Corporation records counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on derivative assets in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparties. These adjustments are necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. The Corporation considers collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation  

Table of Contents  

     adjustment. All or a portion of these counterparty credit valuation adjustments are subsequently adjusted due to changes in the value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparties. During   2011   and   2010  , credit valuation gains (losses) of   $(1.9) billion   and   $731 million   (  $(606) million   and   $(8) million  , net of hedges) for counterparty credit risk related to derivative assets were recognized in trading account profits. These credit valuation adjustments were primarily related to the Corporation s monoline exposure. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment  

reduced the derivative assets balance by   $2.8 billion   and   $6.8 billion  . 
  In addition, the fair value of the Corporation s or its subsidiaries  derivative liabilities is adjusted to reflect the impact of the Corporation s credit quality. During   2011   and   2010  , the Corporation recorded DVA gains of   $1.4 billion   and   $331 million   (  $1.0 billion   and   $262 million  , net of interest rate and foreign exchange hedges) in trading account profits for changes in the Corporation s or its subsidiaries  credit risk. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation s cumulative DVA reduced the derivative liabilities balance by   $2.4 billion   and   $1.1 billion  .

     At   December 31, 2011  , the accumulated net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities included in accumulated OCI were   $3.1 billion  , net of the related income tax expense of   $1.9 billion  . At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation had nonperforming AFS debt securities of   $140 million   and   $44 million  . 
  The Corporation recorded OTTI losses on AFS debt securities for   2011   and   2010   as presented in the table below. A debt security is impaired when its fair value is less than its amortized cost. If the Corporation intends or will more-likely-than-not be required to sell the debt securities prior to recovery, the entire impairment is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For debt securities the Corporation does not intend or will not more-likely- 

than-not be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit or whether it is due to other factors (e.g., interest rate). Credit losses are considered unrecoverable and are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income with the remaining unrealized losses recorded in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss on a debt security may exceed the total impairment, in which case, the portion of the credit loss that exceeds the total impairment is recorded as an unrealized gain in accumulated OCI. Balances in the table below exclude   $9 million   and   $51 million   of unrealized gains recorded in accumulated OCI related to these securities for   2011   and   2010  . 

The Corporation s net impairment losses recognized in earnings consist of write-downs to fair value on AFS securities the Corporation has the intent to sell or will more-likely-than-not be required to sell and credit losses recognized on AFS and HTM securities the Corporation does not have the intent to sell or will not more-likely-than-not be required to sell. The table below presents a rollforward of credit losses recognized in earnings on AFS debt securities these losses as of   December 31, 2011 and 2010   that the Corporation does not have the intent to sell or will not more-likely-than-not be required to sell.  

The Corporation estimates the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model and estimates the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Assumptions used can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by such  

factors as loan interest rate, geographical location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. The Corporation then determines how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each security issued from the structure. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired AFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual impaired AFS debt security. 
  Significant assumptions used in the valuation of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) were as follows at   December 31, 2011  .

    Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the underlying collateral. 
               (2)   
    The value of a variable below which the indicated percentile of observations will fall. 
       
  Additionally, annual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as LTV, creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using FICO scores and geographic concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was   43 percent   for prime bonds,   50 percent   for Alt-A bonds and   60 percent   for subprime bonds at   December 31, 2011  . Additionally, default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to

     LTV, FICO and geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates by collateral type were   36 percent   for prime bonds,   62 percent   for Alt-A bonds and   72 percent   for subprime bonds at   December 31, 2011  .  

The table below presents the fair value and the associated gross unrealized losses on AFS securities with gross unrealized losses at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , and whether these securities have had gross unrealized losses for less than twelve months or for twelve months or longer.

   The amortized cost and fair value of the Corporation s investment in AFS and held-to-maturity debt securities from FNMA, the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), FHLMC and U.S. Treasury securities where the investment exceeded 10 percent of consolidated shareholders  equity at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   are presented in the table below. 

The expected maturity distribution of the Corporation s MBS and the contractual maturity distribution of the Corporation s other AFS debt securities, and the yields on the Corporation s AFS debt securities portfolio at   December 31, 2011   are summarized in the table below. Actual maturities may differ from the contractual or expected maturities since borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

Certain Corporate and Strategic Investments 
  At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation owned   2.0 billion   shares and   25.6 billion   shares representing approximately   one percent   and   10 percent   of China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB). During   2011  , the Corporation sold shares of CCB and in connection therewith recorded gains of   $6.5 billion  . Sales restrictions on the remaining   2.0 billion   CCB shares continue until August 2013 and accordingly these shares are carried at cost. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the cost basis of the  

Corporation s total investment in CCB was   $716 million   and   $9.2 billion  , the carrying value was   $716 million   and   $19.7 billion   and the fair value was   $1.4 billion   and   $20.8 billion  . This investment is recorded in other assets. Dividend income on this investment is recorded in equity investment income and during   2011   and   2010  , the Corporation recorded dividends of   $836 million   and   $535 million   from CCB. The strategic assistance agreement between the Corporation and CCB, which includes cooperation in specific business areas, remains in place. 
  During   2011  , the Corporation sold its remaining ownership interest of approximately   13.6 million   preferred shares, or   seven percent   of BlackRock, Inc. The investment was recorded in other assets at cost. In connection with the sale, the Corporation recorded a gain of   $377 million  .  
  During   2011  , the Corporation recorded   $1.1 billion   of impairment charges on its investment in a merchant services joint venture. The joint venture had a carrying value of   $3.4 billion   and   $4.7 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   with the reduction in carrying value primarily the result of the impairment charges. The impairment charges were based on the ongoing financial performance of the joint venture and updated forecasts of its long-term financial performance.

     NOTE 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases 
  The following tables present total outstanding loans and leases and an aging analysis at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 
  The Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio, as shown in the table below, is a separately managed legacy mortgage portfolio. Legacy Asset Servicing, which was created on January 1, 2011 in connection with the re-alignment of the   Consumer Real Estate Services   (  CRES)   business segment, is responsible for servicing loans on its balance sheet and for others including loans held in other business segments and   All     Other  . This includes servicing  

and managing the runoff and exposures related to selected residential mortgages and home equity loans, including discontinued real estate products, Countrywide PCI loans and certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011. Since making the determination of the pool of loans to be included in the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio, the criteria have not changed for this portfolio; however, the criteria will continue to be evaluated over time.

See   Note 22   Fair Value Measurements   and   Note 23   Fair Value Option   for additional information. 
       
    The Corporation mitigates a portion of its credit risk on the residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic securitization vehicles. These vehicles issue long-term notes to investors, the proceeds of which are held as cash collateral. The Corporation pays a premium to the vehicles to purchase mezzanine loss protection on a portfolio of residential mortgages owned by the Corporation. Cash held in the vehicles is used to reimburse the Corporation in the event that losses on the mortgage portfolio exceed   10   basis points (bps) of the original pool balance, up to the remaining amount of purchased loss protection of   $783 million   and   $1.1 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . The vehicles from which the Corporation purchases credit protection are VIEs. The Corporation does not have a variable interest in these vehicles. Accordingly, these vehicles are not consolidated by the Corporation. Amounts due from the vehicles are recorded in other income (loss) when the Corporation recognizes a reimbursable loss, as described above. Amounts are collected when reimbursable losses are realized through the sale of the underlying collateral. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation had a receivable of   $359 million   and   $722 million   from these vehicles for reimbursement of losses, and principal of   $23.9 billion   and  

$53.9 billion   of residential mortgage loans was referenced under these agreements. The Corporation records an allowance for credit losses on these loans without regard to the existence of the purchased loss protection as the protection does not represent a guarantee of individual loans. 
  In addition, the Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on principal totaling   $23.8 billion   and   $12.9 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , providing full protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans. 
  Nonperforming Loans and Leases 
  The Credit Quality table presents the Corporation s nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Nonperforming loans and leases exclude performing TDRs and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.  

Table of Contents  

     In addition, PCI loans, consumer credit card loans, business card loans and in general consumer loans not secured by real estate, including renegotiated loans, are not considered nonperforming and are therefore excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in the table below. Real estate-secured past due consumer fully- 

insured loans are reported as performing since the principal repayment is insured. See   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles   for further information on the criteria for classification as nonperforming. 

(1)   
    Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , residential mortgage includes   $17.0 billion   and   $8.3 billion   of loans on which interest has been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore are no longer accruing interest, although principal is still insured, and   $4.2 billion   and   $8.5 billion   of loans on which interest is still accruing. 
     n/a = not applicable 
    
    Included in certain loan categories in nonperforming loans and leases in the table above are TDRs that are classified as nonperforming. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation had   $4.7 billion   and   $3.0 billion   of residential mortgages,   $539 million   and   $535 million   of home equity,   $97 million   and   $75 million   of discontinued real estate,   $531 million   and   $175 million   of U.S. commercial,   $1.1 billion   and   $770 million   of commercial real estate and   $38 million   and   $7 million   of non-U.S. commercial loans that were TDRs and classified as nonperforming. 
  Credit Quality Indicators 
  The Corporation monitors credit quality within its three portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles  . Within the home loans portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using CLTV which measures the carrying value of the combined loans that have liens against the property and the available line  

of credit as a percentage of the appraised value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Refreshed FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower s credit history. At a minimum, FICO scores are refreshed quarterly, and in many cases, more frequently. Refreshed FICO score is also a primary credit quality indicator for the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. The Corporation s commercial loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.

     Impaired Loans and Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans, all TDRs, and the renegotiated credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio (the renegotiated credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio, collectively, the renegotiated TDR portfolio). Impaired loans exclude nonperforming consumer loans and nonperforming commercial leases unless they are classified as TDRs. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are also excluded. PCI loans are excluded and reported separately on page   194  . 
  Home Loans 
  Impaired home loans within the home loans portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI loans, substantially all modifications of home loans meet the definition of TDRs. Modifications of home loans are done in accordance with the government s Making Home Affordable Program (modifications under government programs) or the Corporation s proprietary programs (modifications under proprietary programs). These modifications are considered to be TDRs if concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness or combinations thereof. 
  Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. In accordance with new accounting guidance effective in   2011  , a loan is classified as a TDR when a binding offer is extended to borrowers to enter into a trial modification. At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation classified as TDRs   $2.6 billion   of home loans that were participating in or had been offered a binding trial modification. These home loans TDRs had an aggregate allowance of   $154 million   at   December 31, 2011  . Approximately   55 percent   of all loans that entered into a trial modification during   2011   became permanent modifications as of   December 31, 2011  . 
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, home loans are not classified as impaired loans unless they have been designated as a TDR. Once such a loan has been designated as a TDR, it is then individually assessed for impairment. Home loan  

TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Alternatively, home loan TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) are measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Home loans that reached 180 days past due prior to modification would have been charged-off to their net realizable value before they were modified as TDRs in accordance with established policy. Therefore, the modification of home loans that are 180 or more days past due as TDRs does not have an impact on the allowance for credit losses nor are additional charge-offs required at the time of modification. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a TDR. 
  The net present value of the estimated cash flows is based on model-driven estimates of projected payments, prepayments, defaults and loss-given-default (LGD). Using statistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the probability that a loan will default prior to maturity based on the attributes of each loan. The factors that are most relevant to the probability of default are the refreshed LTV or in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed CLTV, borrower credit score, months since origination (i.e., vintage) and geography. Each of these factors is further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). Severity (or LGD) is estimated based on the refreshed LTV for the first mortgages or CLTV for subordinated liens. The estimates are based on the Corporation s historical experience, but are adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors that may not be reflected in the historical data, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default models also incorporate recent experience with modification programs, a loan s default history prior to modification and the change in borrower payments post-modification. 
  At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a home loan TDR were immaterial. Home loan foreclosed properties totaled   $2.0 billion   and   $1.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  .

   The table below presents impaired loans in the Corporation s home loans portfolio segment at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . The impaired home loans table below includes primarily loans managed by Legacy Asset Servicing. Certain impaired home loans do not have a related allowance as the current valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value.

    The table below presents the carrying value of loans that entered into payment default during   2011   and that were modified in a TDR during the 12 months preceding payment default. A payment default for home loan TDRs is recognized when a borrower has missed three monthly payments (not necessarily  

consecutively) since modification. Payment default on trial modification where the borrower has not yet met the terms of the agreement are included in the table below if the borrower is 90 days or more past due three months after the offer to modify is made. 

Credit Card and Other Consumer 
  The credit card and other consumer portfolio segment includes impaired loans that have been modified as a TDR. The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal laws and guidelines. Substantially all of the Corporation s credit card and other consumer loan modifications involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs. In all cases, the customer s available line of credit is canceled. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies which  

provide solutions to customers  entire unsecured debt structures (external programs).  
  All credit card and other consumer loans not secured by real estate, including modified loans, remain on accrual status until the loan is either charged-off or paid in full. The allowance for impaired credit card loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the portfolio s average contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Prior to modification, credit card and other consumer loans are included in homogeneous pools which are collectively evaluated for impairment. For these portfolios, loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including but not limited to historical loss experience, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores.  

Table of Contents  

   The table below provides information on the Corporation s renegotiated TDR portfolio. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the renegotiated TDR portfolio was considered impaired and had a related allowance as shown in the table below.  

(1)   
    Includes accrued interest and fees. 
               (2)   
    Interest income recognized includes interest accrued and collected on the outstanding balances of accruing impaired loans as well as interest cash collections on nonaccruing impaired loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is not uncertain.  
       
  The table below provides information on the Corporation s primary modification programs for the renegotiated TDR portfolio at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  .

    Other programs include ineligible U.K. credit card and other consumer loans. 
       
    At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation had a renegotiated TDR portfolio of   $7.1 billion   and   $11.4 billion   of which   $5.5 billion   was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms at   December 31, 2011  . The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded from nonperforming loans as the Corporation generally does not classify consumer loans not secured by real estate as nonperforming. Instead, these loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes  

180 days past due. 
  The table below provides information on the Corporation s renegotiated TDR portfolio including the unpaid principal balance and carrying value of loans that were modified in TDRs during   2011  , along with charge-offs that were recorded during   2011  . The table also presents the average pre- and post-modification interest rate. 

(1)   
    Includes accrued interest and fees. 

Table of Contents  

   The table below provides information on the Corporation s primary modification programs for the renegotiated TDR portfolio for loans that were modified in TDRs during   2011  . 

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses for impaired credit card and other consumer loans. Loans that entered into payment default during   2011   and that had been modified in a TDR during the 12 months preceding payment default were   $863 million   for U.S. credit card,   $409 million   for non-U.S. credit card and   $180 million   for direct/indirect consumer. 
  Commercial Loans 
  Impaired commercial loans, which include nonperforming loans and TDRs (both performing and nonperforming) are primarily measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate. Commercial impaired loans may also be measured based on observable market prices or, for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell. If the carrying value of a loan exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 
  Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects  

the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions     designed to benefit the customer while mitigating the Corporation s risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan. 
  At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows, observable market prices or collateral value resulting from the modified terms. If there was no forgiveness of principal and the interest rate was not decreased, the modification may have little or no impact on the allowance established for the loan. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. 
  At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were immaterial. Commercial foreclosed properties totaled   $612 million   and   $725 million   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  .

Table of Contents  

     The Commercial table below presents the   December 31, 2011   unpaid principal balance and carrying value of commercial loans that were modified as TDRs during   2011  , along with charge-offs that were recorded during   2011  . As a result of the retrospective application of new accounting guidance on TDRs, the Corporation classified as TDRs   $1.1 billion   of commercial loan modifications. See   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles   for additional information. 

A commercial TDR is generally deemed to be in payment default when the loan is 90 days or more past due, including delinquencies that were not resolved as part of the modification. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows, along with observable market prices or fair value of collateral when measuring the allowance for loan losses. TDRs that were in payment default at   December 31, 2011   had a carrying value of   $164 million   for U.S. commercial,   $446 million   for commercial real estate and   $68 million   for U.S. small business commercial. 
  Purchased Credit-impaired Loans 
  PCI loans are acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination for which it is probable at purchase date that the Corporation will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. PCI loans are pooled based on similar  

characteristics and evaluated for impairment on a pool basis. The Corporation estimates impairment on its PCI loan portfolio in accordance with applicable accounting guidance on contingencies which involves estimating the expected cash flows of each pool using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models. The key assumptions used in the models include the Corporation s estimate of default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds. The carrying value and valuation allowance for Countrywide consumer PCI loans are presented together with the allowance for loan and lease losses. See   Note 7   Allowance for Credit Losses   for additional information. 
  The table below shows activity for the accretable yield on Countrywide consumer PCI loans. The   $912 million   reclassification from nonaccretable difference during   2011   is primarily due to an increase in the expected life of the PCI loans. The reclassification did not increase the annual yield but, as a result of estimated slower prepayment speeds, added additional interest periods to the expected cash flows.  

Loans Held-for-Sale 
  The Corporation had LHFS of   $13.8 billion   and   $35.1 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Proceeds from sales, securitizations and paydowns of LHFS were   $147.5 billion  ,   $281.7 billion   and   $365.1 billion   for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  . Proceeds used for originations and purchases of LHFS were   $118.2 billion  ,   $263.0 billion   and   $369.4 billion   for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  .

   NOTE 7   Allowance for Credit Losses 
  The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  . 

(1)   
    The   2010   balance includes   $10.8 billion   of allowance for loan and lease losses related to the adoption of new consolidation guidance. This includes   $573 million   for the home loans portfolio segment and   $10.2 billion   for the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment.  
       
    In   2011  , for the PCI loan portfolio, the Corporation recorded   $2.2 billion   in provision for credit losses with a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. This compared to   $2.2 billion   in   2010   and   $3.5 billion   in   2009  . PCI loans that were acquired as part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition were excluded from current period PCI disclosures as the valuation allowance associated with these loans is no longer significant. The valuation allowance associated with the PCI loan portfolio was   $8.5 billion  ,   $6.4 billion   and   $3.9 billion   at   December 31, 2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , respectively. 
  The  other  amount under allowance for loan and lease losses for   2011   includes a   $449 million   reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses related to Canadian consumer card loans that were transferred to LHFS. The   2009    other  amount includes  

a   $750 million   reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses related to   $8.5 billion   of credit card loans that were exchanged for a   $7.8 billion   HTM debt security partially offset by a   $340 million   increase associated with the reclassification to other assets of the amount reimbursable under residential mortgage cash collateralized synthetic securitizations. 
  The  other  amount under the reserve for unfunded lending commitments for   2011   and   2010   primarily represents accretion of the Merrill Lynch purchase accounting adjustment and the impact of funding previously unfunded positions. The   2009   amount includes the remaining balance of the acquired Merrill Lynch reserve excluding those commitments accounted for under the fair value option, net of accretion, and the impact of funding previously unfunded positions.

     NOTE 8   Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities 
  The Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its own and its customers  financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. 
  The following tables present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation s maximum exposure to loss at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets. 
  The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement. These securities are included in   Note 3   Trading Account Assets and Liabilities   and   Note 5   Securities  .   In addition, the Corporation uses VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts in connection with its funding activities as described in   Note 13   Long-term Debt  . The Corporation also uses VIEs in the form of synthetic securitization vehicles to mitigate  

a portion of the credit risk on its residential mortgage loan portfolio as described in   Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases  . The Corporation uses VIEs, such as cash funds managed within   Global Wealth   Investment Management (GWIM)  , to provide investment opportunities for clients. These VIEs, which are not consolidated by the Corporation, are not included in the tables within this Note. 
  Except as described below, the Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during   2011   or   2010   that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so. 
  Mortgage-related Securitizations 
  First-lien Mortgages 
  As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or GNMA in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after loan closing or purchase. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described below and in   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. 
  The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for   2011   and   2010  . 

(1)   
    The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans to GSEs in the normal course of business and receives MBS in exchange which may then be sold into the market to third-party investors for cash proceeds. 
               (2)   
    Substantially all of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. As such, gains are recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization. During   2011   and   2010  , the Corporation recognized   $2.9 billion   and   $5.1 billion   of gains on these LHFS, net of hedges. 
       
    In addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above, the Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of   $545 million   and   $23.7 billion   in connection with first-lien mortgage securitizations, principally residential agency securitizations, in   2011   and   2010  . All of these securities were initially classified as Level 2 assets within the fair value hierarchy. During   2011   and   2010  , there were no changes to the initial classification. 
  The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of first-lien mortgage loans. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on consumer mortgage loans serviced, including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were   $5.8 billion   and   $6.4 billion   in   2011   and   2010  . Servicing advances on consumer mortgage loans, including  

securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were   $26.0 billion   and   $24.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. During   2011   and   2010  ,   $9.0 billion   and   $14.5 billion   of loans were repurchased from first-lien securitization trusts as a result of loan delinquencies or in order to perform modifications. The majority of these loans repurchased were FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities. In addition, the Corporation has retained commercial MSRs from the sale or securitization of commercial mortgage loans. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on commercial mortgage loans serviced, including securitizations where the  

Table of Contents  

     Corporation has continuing involvement, were a loss of   $12 million   and a gain of   $21 million   in   2011   and   2010  . Servicing advances on commercial mortgage loans, including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were   $152 million   and   $156 million   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . For additional  

information on MSRs, see   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights  .  
  The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

(1)   
    Maximum loss exposure excludes the liability for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing advances and MSRs. For more information, see   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees     and   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights  . 
               (2)   
    As a holder of these securities, the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest payments. During   2011   and   2010  , there were no OTTI losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt securities. 
               (3)   
    Principal balance outstanding includes loans the Corporation transferred with which the Corporation has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loans. 
       
    As a result of a settlement agreement with Assured Guaranty Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Assured Guaranty) in 2011, the Corporation entered into a loss-sharing reinsurance arrangement involving   21   first-lien RMBS trusts. This obligation is a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the trusts. To the extent that the Corporation services all or a majority of the loans in any of the   21   trusts, the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. At   December 31, 2011  ,   12   of these trusts were consolidated. Assets and liabilities of the consolidated trusts and the Corporation s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated trusts are included in the table above as non-agency prime and subprime trusts. For additional information, see   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  . 

Home Equity Loans 
  The Corporation retains interests in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. These retained interests include senior and subordinate securities and residual interests. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. The Corporation also services the loans in the trusts. Except as described below and in   Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. There were no securitizations of home equity loans during   2011   and   2010  . All of the home equity trusts have entered the amortization phase and, accordingly, there were   no   collections reinvested in revolving period securitizations in   2011  . Collections reinvested in revolving period securitizations were   $21 million   in   2010  . 

Table of Contents  

   The table below summarizes select information related to home equity loan securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

(1)   
    For unconsolidated VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves, and excludes the liability for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. 
                (3)   
    As a holder of these securities, the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest payments. During   2011   and   2010  , there were no OTTI losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt securities. 
        
    Included in the table above are consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan securitizations that have entered a rapid amortization period and for which the Corporation is obligated to provide subordinated funding. During this period, cash payments from borrowers are accumulated to repay outstanding debt securities and the Corporation continues to make advances to borrowers when they draw on their lines of credit. The Corporation then transfers the newly generated receivables into the securitization vehicles and is reimbursed only after other parties in the securitization have received all of the cash flows to which they are entitled. If loan losses requiring draws on monoline insurers  policies, which protect the bondholders in the securitization, exceed a certain level, the Corporation may not receive reimbursement for all of the funds advanced to borrowers, as the senior bondholders and the monoline insurers have priority for repayment. The Corporation evaluates each of these securitizations for potential losses due to non-recoverable advances by estimating the amount and timing of future losses on the underlying loans, the excess spread available to cover such losses and potential cash flow shortfalls during rapid amortization. This evaluation, which includes the number of loans still in revolving status, the amount of available credit and when those loans will lose revolving status, is also used to determine whether the  

Corporation has a variable interest that is more than insignificant and must consolidate the trust. A maximum funding obligation attributable to rapid amortization cannot be calculated as a home equity borrower has the ability to pay down and re-draw balances. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , home equity loan securitization transactions in rapid amortization for which the Corporation has a subordinate funding obligation, including both consolidated and unconsolidated trusts, had   $10.7 billion   and   $12.5 billion   of trust certificates outstanding. This amount is significantly greater than the amount the Corporation expects to fund. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn available credit on the home equity lines, which totaled   $460 million   and   $639 million   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , as well as performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the reserve for losses on expected future draw obligations on the home equity loan securitizations in rapid amortization for which the Corporation has a subordinated funding obligation was   $69 million   and   $131 million  . 
  The Corporation has consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of home equity loans. The Corporation recorded   $62 million   and   $79 million   of servicing fee income related to home equity securitizations during   2011   and   2010  .

     Credit Card Securitizations 
  The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation s continuing involvement with the securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including senior and subordinate securities, discount receivables, subordinate interests in accrued  
  interest and fees on the securitized receivables, and cash reserve  

accounts. The seller s interest in the trusts, which is pari passu to the investors  interest, and the discount receivables are classified in loans and leases. 
  The table below summarizes select information related to credit card securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

During   2010  ,   $2.9 billion   of new senior debt securities were issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trusts and   none   were issued in   2011  . 
  During   2010  , subordinate securities with a notional principal amount of   $11.5 billion   and a stated interest rate of   zero percent   were issued by certain credit card securitization trusts to the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation elected to designate a specified percentage of new receivables transferred to the trusts as  discount receivables  such that principal collections thereon are added to finance charges which increases the yield in the trust.  

Through the designation of newly transferred receivables as discount receivables, the Corporation has subordinated a portion of its seller s interest to the investors  interest. These actions, which were specifically permitted by the terms of the trust documents, were taken in an effort to address the decline in the excess spread of the U.S. and U.K. credit card securitization trusts. The U.S. election expired June 30, 2011. The issuance of subordinate securities and the discount receivables election had no impact on the Corporation s results of operations in   2011   and   2010  .

   Other Asset-backed Securitizations 
  Other asset-backed securitizations include resecuritization trusts, municipal bond trusts, and automobile and other securitization trusts. The table below summarizes select information related to other asset-backed securitizations in which the Corporation held a variable interest at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

(1)   
    As a holder of these securities, the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest payments. During   2011   and   2010  , there were no OTTI losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt securities. 
               (2)   
    The retained senior and subordinate securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). 
               (3)   
    The retained residual interests are carried at fair value which was derived using model valuations (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). 
       Resecuritization Trusts 
  The Corporation transfers existing securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization vehicles at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. The Corporation may also enter into resecuritizations of securities within its investment portfolio for purposes of improving liquidity and capital, and managing credit or interest rate risk. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. 
  The Corporation resecuritized   $33.6 billion   of securities in   2011   compared to   $97.7 billion   in   2010  . Net gains on sales totaled   $909 million   in   2011   compared to net losses of   $144 million   in   2010  . The Corporation consolidates a resecuritization trust if it has sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the trust. If one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust and purchase a significant portion of securities, including subordinate securities issued by non-agency trusts, the Corporation does not consolidate the trust. 

Municipal Bond Trusts 
  The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. A majority of the bonds are rated AAA or AA and some benefit from insurance provided by third parties. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other basis to third-party investors. The Corporation may serve as remarketing agent and/or liquidity provider for the trusts. The floating-rate investors have the right to tender the certificates at specified dates, often with as little as seven days  notice. Should the Corporation be unable to remarket the tendered certificates, it is generally obligated to purchase them at par under standby liquidity facilities unless the bond s credit rating has declined below investment grade or there has been an event of default or bankruptcy of the issuer and insurer. 
  The Corporation also provides credit enhancement to investors in certain municipal bond trusts whereby the Corporation guarantees the payment of interest and principal on floating-rate certificates issued by these trusts in the event of default by the issuer of the underlying municipal bond. If a customer holds the residual interest in a trust, that customer typically has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust at any time, while the  

Table of Contents  

     Corporation typically has the ability to trigger the liquidation of that trust if the market value of the bonds held in the trust declines below a specified threshold. This arrangement is designed to limit market losses to an amount that is less than the customer s residual interest, effectively preventing the Corporation from absorbing losses incurred on assets held within that trust. 
  During   2011   and   2010  , the Corporation was the transferor of assets into unconsolidated municipal bond trusts and received cash proceeds from new securitizations of   $733 million   and   $1.2 billion  . At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the principal balance outstanding for unconsolidated municipal bond securitization trusts for which the Corporation was transferor was   $2.5 billion   and   $2.2 billion  . 
  The Corporation s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled   $3.5 billion   and   $4.0 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at   December 31, 2011   was   10.0   years. There were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during   2011  . 
  Automobile and Other Securitization Trusts 
  The Corporation transfers automobile and other loans into securitization trusts, typically to improve liquidity or manage credit risk. At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation serviced assets or otherwise had continuing involvement with automobile and other securitization trusts with outstanding balances of   $5.8 billion  , including trusts collateralized by automobile loans of   $3.9 billion  , student loans of   $1.2 billion  , and other loans and receivables of  

$668 million  . At   December 31, 2010  , the Corporation serviced assets or otherwise had continuing involvement with automobile and other securitization trusts with outstanding balances of   $10.5 billion  , including trusts collateralized by automobile loans of   $8.4 billion  , student loans of   $1.3 billion  , and other loans and receivables of   $774 million  . 
  Collateralized Debt Obligation Vehicles 
  CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which they fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. Synthetic CDOs enter into a portfolio of CDS to synthetically create exposure to fixed-income securities. CLOs are a subset of CDOs which hold pools of loans, typically corporate loans or commercial mortgages. CDOs are typically managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs, including a CDS counterparty for synthetic CDOs. The Corporation has also entered into total return swaps with certain CDOs whereby the Corporation absorbs the economic returns generated by specified assets held by the CDO. The Corporation receives fees for structuring CDOs and providing liquidity support for super senior tranches of securities issued by certain CDOs. No third parties provide a significant amount of similar commitments to these CDOs. 
  The table below summarizes select information related to CDO vehicles in which the Corporation held a variable interest at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

The Corporation s maximum loss exposure of   $4.0 billion   at   December 31, 2011   included   $336 million   of super senior CDO exposure,   $1.7 billion   of exposure to CDO financing facilities and   $2.0 billion   of other non-super senior exposure. This exposure is calculated on a gross basis and does not reflect any benefit from insurance purchased from third parties. Net of this insurance but including securities retained from liquidations of CDOs, the Corporation s net exposure to super senior CDO-related positions was   $152 million   at   December 31, 2011  . The CDO financing facilities, which are consolidated, obtain funding from third parties for CDO positions which are principally classified in trading account assets on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The CDO financing facilities  long-term debt at   December 31, 2011   totaled   $2.6 billion  , all of which has recourse to the general credit of the  

Corporation. The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss is significantly less than the total assets of the CDO vehicles in the table above because the Corporation typically has exposure to only a portion of the total assets. 
  At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation had   $2.4 billion   of aggregate liquidity exposure to CDOs. This amount included   $588 million   of commitments to CDOs to provide funding for super senior exposures and   $1.8 billion   notional amount of derivative contracts with unconsolidated VIEs, principally CDO vehicles, which hold non-super senior CDO debt securities or other debt securities on the Corporation s behalf. See   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies   for additional information. The Corporation s liquidity exposure to CDOs at   December 31, 2011   is included in the table above to the extent that the Corporation sponsored the  

Table of Contents  

     CDO vehicle or the liquidity exposure is more than insignificant compared to total assets of the CDO vehicle. Liquidity exposure included in the table is reported net of previously recorded losses. 
  Customer Vehicles 
  Customer vehicles include credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles, repackaging vehicles and asset acquisition vehicles,  

which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company or financial instrument. 
  The table below summarizes select information related to customer vehicles in which the Corporation held a variable interest at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

Credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles issue notes which pay a return that is linked to the credit or equity risk of a specified company or debt instrument. The vehicles purchase high-grade assets as collateral and enter into CDSs or equity derivatives to synthetically create the credit or equity risk to pay the specified return on the notes. The Corporation is typically the counterparty for some or all of the credit and equity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, it may invest in securities issued by the vehicles. The Corporation may also enter into interest rate or foreign currency derivatives with the vehicles. The Corporation also had approximately   $824 million   of other liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with unconsolidated credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles at   December 31, 2011  . 
  Repackaging vehicles issue notes that are designed to incorporate risk characteristics desired by customers. The vehicles hold debt instruments such as corporate bonds, convertible bonds or ABS with the desired credit risk profile. The Corporation enters into derivatives with the vehicles to change the interest rate or foreign currency profile of the debt instruments. If a vehicle holds convertible bonds and the Corporation retains the conversion option, the Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and consolidates the vehicle. 
  Asset acquisition vehicles acquire financial instruments, typically loans, at the direction of a single customer and obtain funding through the issuance of structured liabilities to the  

Corporation. At the time the vehicle acquires an asset, the Corporation enters into total return swaps with the customer such that the economic returns of the asset are passed through to the customer. The Corporation is exposed to counterparty credit risk if the asset declines in value and the customer defaults on its obligation to the Corporation under the total return swaps. The Corporation s risk may be mitigated by collateral or other arrangements. The Corporation consolidates these vehicles because it has the power to manage the assets in the vehicles and owns all of the structured liabilities issued by the vehicles. 
  The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss from customer vehicles includes the notional amount of the credit or equity derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation s investment, if any, in securities issued by the vehicles. It has not been reduced to reflect the benefit of offsetting swaps with the customers or collateral arrangements. 
  Other Variable Interest Entities 
  Other consolidated VIEs primarily include investment vehicles, leveraged lease trusts and, at   December 31, 2010  , a collective investment fund and asset acquisition conduits. Other unconsolidated VIEs primarily include investment vehicles and real estate vehicles. 

Table of Contents  

   The table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

Investment Vehicles 
  The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing to a variety of investment vehicles that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation s consolidated investment vehicles had total assets of   $2.6 billion   and   $5.6 billion  . The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated vehicles with total assets of   $5.5 billion   and   $7.9 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment vehicles totaled   $4.4 billion   and   $8.7 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities. 
  Collective Investment Funds 
  The Corporation is trustee for certain common and collective investment funds that provide investment opportunities for eligible clients of   GWIM  . These funds, which had total assets of   $11.1 billion   and   $21.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , hold a variety of cash, debt and equity investments. At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation did not have a variable interest in these funds. The Corporation consolidated a stable value collective investment fund with total assets of   $8.1 billion   at   December 31, 2010  , for which the Corporation had the unilateral ability to replace the fund s asset manager. The fund was liquidated during 2011.  
  Leveraged Lease Trusts 
  The Corporation s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled   $4.8 billion   and   $5.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial  

aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. The Corporation has no liquidity exposure to these leveraged lease trusts. 
  Asset Acquisition Conduits 
  The Corporation administered two asset acquisition conduits which acquired assets on behalf of the Corporation or its customers. These conduits had total assets of   $640 million   at   December 31, 2010  . The conduits were liquidated during 2011. Liquidation of the conduits did not impact the Corporation s results of operations.  
  Real Estate Vehicles 
  The Corporation held investments in unconsolidated real estate vehicles of   $5.4 billion   at both   December 31, 2011   and   2010   which consisted of investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner and has control over the significant activities of the partnership. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the affordable housing projects. The Corporation s risk of loss is mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.

     Other Asset-backed Financing Arrangements 
  The Corporation transferred pools of securities to certain independent third parties and provided financing for approximately   75 percent   of the purchase price under asset-backed financing arrangements. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation s maximum loss exposure under these financing arrangements was   $4.7 billion   and   $6.5 billion  , substantially all of which was classified as loans on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet. All principal and interest payments have been received when due in accordance with the contractual terms. These arrangements are not included in the Other VIEs table because the purchasers are not VIEs. 
    NOTE 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees 
  Background 
  The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans, generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monolines or financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities), or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. These representations and warranties, as set forth in the agreements, related to, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, the process used to select the loan for inclusion in a transaction, the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria, including underwriting standards, and the loan s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan buyers, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In such cases, the Corporation would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guaranty payments that it may receive. 
  Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable sales and securitization agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced by the GSEs, HUD, VA, the whole-loan buyer, the securitization trustee or others as governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien and home equity securitizations where monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers have insured all or some of the securities issued, by the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor. In the case of loans sold to parties other than the GSEs or GNMA, the contractual liability to repurchase typically arises only if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor, or investors, in the loan, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). Contracts with the GSEs do not contain equivalent language, while GNMA generally limits repurchases to loans that are not insured or guaranteed as required. The Corporation  

believes that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less likely it is that an alleged underwriting breach of representations and warranties had a material impact on the loan s performance. Historically, most demands for repurchase have occurred within the first several years after origination, generally after a loan has defaulted. However, the time horizon in which repurchase claims are typically brought has lengthened primarily due to a significant increase in GSE claims related to loans that had defaulted more than   18   months prior to the claim and to loans where the borrower made at least   25   payments. 
  The Corporation s credit loss would be reduced by any recourse it may have to organizations (e.g., correspondents) that, in turn, had sold such loans to the Corporation based upon its agreements with these organizations. When a loan is originated by a correspondent or other third party, the Corporation typically has the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from that originator. Many of the correspondent originators of loans in   2004   through   2008   are no longer in business, or are in a weakened condition, and the Corporation s ability to recover on valid claims is therefore impacted, or eliminated accordingly. In the event a loan is originated and underwritten by a correspondent who obtains FHA insurance, even if they are no longer in business, any breach of FHA guidelines is the direct obligation of the correspondent, not the Corporation. At   December 31, 2011  , approximately   28 percent   of the outstanding repurchase claims relate to loans purchased from correspondents or other parties compared to approximately   25 percent   at   December 31, 2010  . During   2011  , the Corporation experienced a decline in recoveries from correspondents and other parties; however, the actual recovery rate may vary from period to period based upon the underlying mix of correspondents and other parties. 
  The Corporation currently structures its operations to limit the risk of repurchase and accompanying credit exposure by seeking to ensure consistent production of mortgages in accordance with its underwriting procedures and by servicing those mortgages consistent with its contractual obligations. In addition, certain securitizations include guarantees written to protect certain purchasers of the loans from credit losses up to a specified amount. The fair value of the obligations to be absorbed under the representations and warranties and guarantees provided is recorded as an accrued liability when the loans are sold. This liability for probable losses is updated by accruing a representations and warranties provision in mortgage banking income. This is done throughout the life of the loan, as necessary when additional relevant information becomes available.  
  The methodology used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors, which include, depending on the counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that a repurchase claim will be received, including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased. The Corporation also considers bulk settlements when determining its estimated liability for representations and warranties. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of the liability and could have a material adverse impact  

Table of Contents  

     on the Corporation s results of operations for any particular period. Given that these factors vary by counterparty, the Corporation analyzes representations and warranties obligations based on the specific counterparty, or type of counterparty, with whom the sale was made. Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase claims from the FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed securities is not significant because the requests are limited in number and are typically resolved quickly. 
  Settlement Actions 
  The Corporation has vigorously contested any request for repurchase when it has concluded that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, the Corporation has reached bulk settlements, or agreements for bulk settlements, including settlement amounts which have been material, with counterparties in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process. The Corporation may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms it believes to be advantageous to the Corporation. The following provides a summary of the larger bulk settlement actions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 followed by details of the Corporation s representations and warranties liability, including claims status. 
  Settlement with the Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee 
  On   June 28, 2011  , the Corporation, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (BAC HLS, which was subsequently merged with and into BANA in July 2011), and its legacy Countrywide affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), as trustee (the Trustee), to resolve all outstanding and potential claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches (including repurchase claims), substantially all historical loan servicing claims and certain other historical claims with respect to   525   legacy Countrywide first-lien and   five   second-lien non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts (the Covered Trusts) containing loans principally originated between   2004   and   2008   for which BNY Mellon acts as trustee or indenture trustee (the BNY Mellon Settlement). The Covered Trusts had an original principal balance of approximately   $424 billion  , of which   $409 billion   was originated between   2004   and   2008  , and total outstanding principal and unpaid principal balance of loans that had defaulted (collectively unpaid principal balance) of approximately   $220 billion   at   June 28, 2011  , of which   $217 billion   was originated between   2004   and   2008  . The BNY Mellon Settlement is supported by a group of   22   institutional investors (the Investor Group) and is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions. 
  The BNY Mellon Settlement provides for a cash payment of   $8.5 billion   (the Settlement Payment) to the Trustee for distribution to the Covered Trusts after final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement. In addition to the Settlement Payment, the Corporation is obligated to pay attorneys  fees and costs to the Investor Group s counsel as well as all fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee related to obtaining final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement and certain tax rulings, which are currently estimated at   $100 million  .  
  The BNY Mellon Settlement does not cover a small number of legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE RMBS transactions with loans originated principally between   2004   and   2008   for various reasons, including for example,   six   legacy Countrywide- 

issued first-lien non-GSE RMBS transactions in which BNY Mellon is not the trustee. The BNY Mellon Settlement also does not cover legacy Countrywide-issued second-lien securitization transactions in which a monoline insurer or other financial guarantor provides financial guaranty insurance. In addition, because the settlement is with the Trustee on behalf of the Covered Trusts and releases rights under the governing agreements for the Covered Trusts, the settlement does not release investors  securities law or fraud claims based upon disclosures made in connection with their decision to purchase, sell or hold securities issued by the Covered Trusts. To date, various investors, including certain members of the Investor Group, are pursuing securities law or fraud claims related to one or more of the Covered Trusts. The Corporation is not able to determine whether any additional securities law or fraud claims will be made by investors in the Covered Trusts. For information about mortgage-related securities law or fraud claims, see Litigation and Regulatory Matters in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  . For those Covered Trusts where a monoline insurer or other financial guarantor has an independent right to assert repurchase claims directly, the BNY Mellon Settlement does not release such insurer s or guarantor s repurchase claims. 
  Under an order entered by the court in connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, potentially interested persons had the opportunity to give notice of intent to object to the settlement (including on the basis that more information was needed) until August 30, 2011. Approximately   44   groups or entities appeared prior to the deadline;   two   of those groups or entities have subsequently withdrawn from the proceeding and one motion to intervene was denied. Certain of these groups or entities filed notices of intent to object, made motions to intervene, or both filed notices of intent to object and made motions to intervene. The parties filing motions to intervene include the Attorneys General of the states of New York and Delaware, whose motions to intervene were granted. Parties who filed notices stating that they wished to obtain more information about the settlement include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Bank of America is not a party to the proceeding. 
  Certain of the motions to intervene and/or notices of intent to object allege various purported bases for opposition to the settlement, including challenges to the nature of the court proceeding and the lack of an opt-out mechanism, alleged conflicts of interest on the part of the Investor Group and/or the Trustee, the inadequacy of the settlement amount and the method of allocating the settlement amount among the Covered Trusts, while other motions do not make substantive objections but state that they need more information about the settlement. An investor opposed to the settlement removed the proceeding to federal court. On   October 19, 2011  , the federal court denied BNY Mellon s motion to remand the proceeding to state court. BNY Mellon, as well as the investors that have intervened in support of the BNY Mellon Settlement, petitioned to appeal the denial of this motion. On November 4, 2011, the district court entered a written order setting a discovery schedule, and discovery is ongoing. On   December 27, 2011  , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted the appeal and stated in an amended scheduling order that, pursuant to statute, it would rule on the appeal by   February 27, 2012  .  
  It is not currently possible to predict how many of the parties who have appeared in the court proceeding will ultimately object to the BNY Mellon Settlement, whether the objections will prevent receipt of final court approval or the ultimate outcome of the court

     approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. In particular, conduct of discovery and the resolution of the objections to the settlement and any appeals could take a substantial period of time and these factors could materially delay the timing of final court approval. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict when the court approval process will be completed. 
  If final court approval is not obtained by   December 31, 2015  , the Corporation and legacy Countrywide may withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement, if the Trustee consents. The BNY Mellon Settlement also provides that if Covered Trusts representing unpaid principal balance exceeding a specified amount are excluded from the final BNY Mellon Settlement, based on investor objections or otherwise, the Corporation and legacy Countrywide have the option to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement pursuant to the terms of the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement. 
  There can be no assurance that final court approval of the settlement will be obtained, that all conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied or, if certain conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, that the Corporation and legacy Countrywide will not determine to withdraw from the settlement. If final court approval is not obtained or if the Corporation and legacy Countrywide determine to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, the Corporation s future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different than existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals described under   Whole Loan Sales and Private-label Securitizations Experience   on page   212  . 
  Settlement with Assured Guaranty 
  On   April 14, 2011  , the Corporation, including its legacy Countrywide affiliates, entered into an agreement with Assured Guaranty, to resolve all of the monoline insurer s outstanding and potential repurchase claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches involving   29   first- and second-lien RMBS trusts where Assured Guaranty provided financial guarantee insurance (the Assured Guaranty Settlement). The agreement also resolves historical loan servicing issues and other potential liabilities with respect to these trusts. The agreement covers   21   first-lien RMBS trusts and   eight   second-lien RMBS trusts, which had an original principal balance of approximately   $35.8 billion   and total unpaid principal balance of approximately   $20.2 billion   as of   April 14, 2011  . The agreement included cash payments totaling approximately   $1.1 billion   to Assured Guaranty, as well as a loss-sharing reinsurance arrangement that had an expected value of approximately   $470 million   at the time of the settlement, and other terms, including termination of certain derivative contracts. During 2011, the Corporation made cash payments of   $1.0 billion   with the remaining   $57 million   payable on March 31, 2012. The total cost recognized for the Assured Guaranty Settlement as of   December 31, 2011   was approximately   $1.6 billion  . As a result of this agreement, the Corporation recorded   $2.2 billion   in consumer loans and the related trust debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2011  , due to the  

establishment of reinsurance contracts at the time of the Assured Guaranty Settlement. 
  Government-sponsored Enterprise Agreements 
  On   December 31, 2010  , the Corporation reached agreements with the GSEs, under which the Corporation paid   $2.8 billion   to resolve repurchase claims involving first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs by entities related to legacy Countrywide (the GSE Agreements). The agreement with FHLMC extinguished all outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to FHLMC through   2008  , subject to certain exceptions. The agreement with FNMA substantially resolved the existing pipeline of repurchase claims outstanding as of September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. The GSE Agreements did not cover outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to legacy Bank of America first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs or other loans sold directly to the GSEs other than described above, loan servicing obligations, other contractual obligations or loans contained in private-label securitizations. 
  Outstanding Claims 
  The Outstanding Claims by Counterparty and Product table presents outstanding representations and warranties claims by counterparty and product type at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . For additional information, see   Whole Loan Sales and Private-label Securitizations Experience   on page   212   of this Note and   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  . These repurchase claims include   $1.7 billion   in demands from investors in the Covered Trusts received in   2010  , but otherwise do not include any repurchase claims related to the Covered Trusts. During   2011  , the Corporation received   $17.5 billion   in new repurchase claims, including   $14.3 billion   in new repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs for both legacy Countrywide originations not covered by the GSE Agreements and legacy Bank of America originations, and   $3.2 billion   in repurchase claims related to non-GSE transactions. During   2011  ,   $14.1 billion   in claims were resolved primarily with the GSEs and through the Assured Guaranty Settlement. Of the claims resolved,   $7.5 billion   were resolved through rescissions and   $6.6 billion   were resolved through mortgage repurchase and make-whole payments. Claims outstanding from the monolines declined as a result of the Assured Guaranty Settlement, and new claims from other monolines declined significantly during 2011, which the Corporation believes was due in part to the monolines focusing recent efforts towards litigation. Outstanding claims from whole loan, private-label securitization and other investors increased during 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in repurchase claims received from trustees in non-GSE transactions.

    Excludes certain MI rescission notices. However, includes   $1.2 billion   of repurchase requests received from the GSEs that have resulted solely from MI rescission notices. For additional information, see   Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices   in this Note. 
               (2)   
    Amounts for   December 31, 2011   and   2010   included   $1.7 billion   in demands contained in correspondence from private-label securitizations investors in the Covered Trusts that do not have the right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files. For additional information, see   Settlement with Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee   in this Note. 
       
  The number of repurchase claims as a percentage of the number of loans purchased arising from loans sourced from brokers or purchased from third-party sellers is relatively consistent with the number of repurchase claims as a percentage of the number of loans originated by the Corporation or its subsidiaries or legacy companies. 
  Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices 
  In addition to repurchase claims, the Corporation receives notices from mortgage insurance companies of claim denials, cancellations, or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices) and the amount of such notices have remained elevated. When there is disagreement with the mortgage insurer as to the resolution of a MI rescission notice, meaningful dialogue and negotiation are generally necessary between the parties to reach a conclusion on an individual notice. The level of engagement of the mortgage insurance companies varies and on-going litigation involving some of the mortgage insurance companies over individual and bulk rescissions or claims for rescission limits the ability of the Corporation to engage in constructive dialogue leading to resolution. For loans sold to GSEs or private-label securitization trusts (including those wrapped by the monoline bond insurers), a MI rescission may give rise to a claim for breach of the applicable representations and warranties, depending on the governing sales contracts. In those cases where the governing contract contains a MI-related representation and warranty which upon rescission requires the Corporation to repurchase the affected loan or indemnify the investor for the related loss, the Corporation realizes the loss without the benefit of MI. If the Corporation is required to repurchase a loan or indemnify the investor as a result of a different breach of representations and warranties and there has been a MI rescission, or if the Corporation holds the loan for investment, it realizes the loss without the benefit of MI. In addition, mortgage insurance companies have in some cases asserted the ability to curtail MI payments, which in these cases would reduce the MI proceeds available to reduce the loss on the loan. While a legitimate MI rescission may constitute a valid basis for repurchase or other remedies under the GSE agreements and a  

small number of private-label MBS securitizations, and a MI rescission notice may result in a repurchase request, the Corporation believes MI rescission notices in and of themselves are not valid repurchase requests. 
  On June 30, 2011, FNMA issued an announcement requiring servicers to report, effective   October 1, 2011  , all MI rescissions, cancellations and claim denials (together, rescissions) with respect to loans sold to FNMA. The announcement also confirmed FNMA s view of its position that a mortgage insurance company s issuance of a MI rescission notice constitutes a breach of the lender s representations and warranties and permits FNMA to require the lender to repurchase the mortgage loan or promptly remit a make-whole payment covering FNMA s loss even if the lender is contesting the MI rescission notice. A related announcement included a ban on bulk settlements with mortgage insurers that provide for loss sharing in lieu of rescission. According to FNMA s announcement, through   June 30, 2012  , lenders have 90 days to appeal FNMA s repurchase request and 30 days (or such other time frame specified by FNMA) to appeal after that date. According to FNMA s announcement, in order to be successful in its appeal, a lender must provide documentation confirming reinstatement or continuation of coverage. This announcement could result in more repurchase requests from FNMA than the assumptions in the Corporation s estimated liability contemplate. The Corporation also expects that in many cases (particularly in the context of individual or bulk rescissions being contested through litigation), it will not be able to resolve MI rescission notices with the mortgage insurance companies before the expiration of the appeal period prescribed by the FNMA announcement. The Corporation has informed FNMA that it does not believe that the new policy is valid under its contracts with FNMA, and that it does not intend to repurchase loans under the terms set forth in the new policy. The Corporation s pipeline of outstanding repurchase claims from the GSEs resulting solely on MI rescission notices has increased during   2011   by   $935 million   to   $1.2 billion   at   December 31, 2011  . If it is required to abide by the terms of the new FNMA policy, the Corporation s representations and warranties liability will likely increase. 
  At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation had approximately   90,000   open MI rescission notices compared to   72,000   at   December 31, 2010  . Through   December 31, 2011  ,   26 percent   of the MI rescission notices received have been resolved. Of those resolved,   24 percent   were resolved through the Corporation s acceptance of the MI rescission,   46 percent   were resolved through reinstatement of coverage or payment of the claim by the mortgage insurance company, and   30 percent   were resolved on an aggregate basis through settlement, policy commutation or similar arrangement. As of   December 31, 2011  ,   74 percent   of the MI rescission notices the Corporation has received have not yet been resolved. Of those not yet resolved,   48 percent   are implicated by ongoing litigation where no loan-level review is currently contemplated (nor required to preserve the Corporation s legal rights). In this litigation, the litigating mortgage insurance companies are also seeking bulk rescission of certain policies, separate and apart from loan-by-loan denials or rescissions. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing   11 percent   of the remaining open MI rescission notices, and the Corporation has reviewed and is contesting the MI rescission with respect to   89 percent   of these remaining open MI rescission notices. Of the remaining open MI rescission notices,   29 percent   are also the

     subject of ongoing litigation although, at present, these MI rescissions are being processed in a manner generally consistent with those not affected by litigation.  
  Cash Settlements 
  As presented in the Loan Repurchases and Indemnification Payments table, during   2011   and   2010  , the Corporation paid   $5.2 billion   and   $5.2 billion   to resolve   $6.2 billion   and   $6.6 billion   of repurchase claims through repurchase or reimbursement to the investor or securitization trust for losses they incurred, resulting in a loss on the related loans at the time of repurchase or reimbursement of   $3.5 billion   and   $3.5 billion  . Cash paid for loan repurchases includes the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus past due interest. The amount of loss for loan repurchases is reduced by the fair value of the underlying loan collateral. The repurchase of loans and indemnification payments related to first-lien and home equity repurchase claims generally resulted from material breaches of representations and warranties related to  

the loans  material compliance with the applicable underwriting standards, including borrower misrepresentation, credit exceptions without sufficient compensating factors and non-compliance with underwriting procedures. The actual representations and warranties made in a sales transaction and the resulting repurchase and indemnification activity can vary by transaction or investor. A direct relationship between the type of defect that causes the breach of representations and warranties and the severity of the realized loss has not been observed. Transactions to repurchase or indemnification payments related to first-lien residential mortgages primarily involved the GSEs while transactions to repurchase or indemnification payments for home equity loans primarily involved the monoline insurers. In addition to the amounts previously discussed, the Corporation paid   $1.0 billion   during   2011   to Assured Guaranty as part of the Assured Guaranty Settlement. The table below presents first-lien and home equity loan repurchases and indemnification payments for   2011   and   2010  . 

Liability for Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees 
  The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income (loss). The Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees table presents a rollforward of the liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees. 

The liability for representations and warranties is established when those obligations are both probable and reasonably estimable. For   2011  , the provision for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees was   $15.6 billion   compared to   $6.8 billion   in   2010  . Of the   $15.6 billion   provision recorded in   2011  ,   $8.6 billion   was attributable to the BNY Mellon Settlement and   $7.0 billion   was related to other exposures. The BNY Mellon Settlement led to the determination that the Corporation has sufficient experience to record a liability related to its exposure on certain other private-label securitizations. This determination combined with higher estimated GSE repurchase rates were the primary drivers of the balance of the provision in   2011  . GSE repurchase rates increased driven by higher than expected claims during   2011  , including claims on loans that defaulted more than   18   months prior to the repurchase request and on loans where the borrower has made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least   25   payments), in each case in numbers that were not expected based on historical claims. 

Table of Contents  

     Estimated Range of Possible Loss 
  Government-sponsored Enterprises 
  The Corporation s estimated provision and liability at December 31, 2011, for obligations under representations and warranties given to the GSEs considers, among other things, and is necessarily dependent on and limited by, its historical claims experience with the GSEs. It includes the Corporation s understanding of its agreements with the GSEs and projections of future defaults as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. The Corporation s estimate of the liability for these obligations has been accounted for in the recorded liability for representations and warranties for these loans. In recent periods, the Corporation has been experiencing elevated levels of new claims from the GSEs, including claims on loans on which borrowers have made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least   25   payments) or on loans which had defaulted more than   18   months prior to the repurchase request, in each case in numbers that were not expected based on historical experience. The criteria by which the GSEs are ultimately willing to resolve claims have changed in ways that are unfavorable to the Corporation. While the Corporation is seeking to resolve its differences with the GSEs concerning each party s interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, whether it will be able to achieve a resolution of these differences on acceptable terms and timing thereof, is subject to significant uncertainty. The Corporation intends repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern its relationships with the GSEs. 
  The Corporation is not able to predict changes in the behavior of the GSEs based on the Corporation s past experiences. Therefore, it is not possible to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to any such potential impact in excess of current accrued liabilities. 
  Counterparties other than Government-sponsored Enterprises 
  The population of private-label securitizations included in the BNY Mellon Settlement encompasses almost all legacy Countrywide first-lien private-label securitizations including loans originated principally in the   2004   through   2008   vintage. For the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, the Corporation believes it is probable that other claimants in certain types of securitizations may come forward with claims that meet the requirements of the terms of the securitizations. The Corporation has seen an increased trend in requests for loan files from private-label securitization trustees and an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet required standards. The Corporation believes that the provisions recorded in connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement and the additional non-GSE representations and warranties provisions recorded in   2011   have provided for a substantial portion of the Corporation s non-GSE representations and warranties exposures. However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. In addition, as discussed below, the Corporation has not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential monoline exposures and certain potential whole-loan and other private-label securitization exposures. The Corporation currently estimates that the range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of   December 31, 2011  , could be up to   $5 billion   over existing accruals. This  

estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions, including those set forth below, that are subject to change. 
  The methodology used to estimate the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss considers a variety of factors including the Corporation s experience related to actual defaults, projected future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Among the factors that impact the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss are: (1) contractual material adverse effect requirements, (2) the representations and warranties provided and (3) the requirement to meet certain presentation thresholds. The first factor is based on the Corporation s belief that a non-GSE contractual liability to repurchase a loan generally arises only if the counterparties prove there is a breach of representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all investors, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable), in a securitization trust and, accordingly, the Corporation believes that the repurchase claimants must prove that the alleged representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss. The second factor is related to the fact that non-GSE securitizations include different types of representations and warranties than those provided to the GSEs. The Corporation believes the non-GSE securitizations  representations and warranties are less rigorous and actionable than the explicit provisions of comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs. The third factor is related to the fact that certain presentation thresholds need to be met in order for any repurchase claim to be asserted on the initiative of investors under the non-GSE agreements. A securitization trustee may investigate or demand repurchase on its own action, and most agreements contain a threshold, for example   25 percent   of the voting rights per trust, that allows investors to declare a servicing event of default under certain circumstances or to request certain action, such as requesting loan files, that the trustee may choose to accept and follow, exempt from liability, provided the trustee is acting in good faith. If there is an uncured servicing event of default and the trustee fails to bring suit during a   60  -day period, then, under most agreements, investors may file suit. In addition to this, most agreements also allow investors to direct the securitization trustee to investigate loan files or demand the repurchase of loans if security holders hold a specified percentage, for example   25 percent  , of the voting rights of each tranche of the outstanding securities. Although the Corporation continues to believe that presentation thresholds are a factor in the determination of probable loss, given the BNY Mellon Settlement, the estimated range of possible loss assumes that the presentation threshold can be met for all of the non-GSE securitization transactions. 
  In addition, in the case of private-label securitizations, the methodology used to estimate the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss considers the implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement are satisfied. Since the non-GSE transactions that were included in the BNY Mellon Settlement differ from those that were not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement, the Corporation adjusted the experience implied in the settlement in  

Table of Contents  

     order to determine the estimated non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss. The judgmental adjustments made include consideration of the differences in the mix of products in the securitizations, loan originator, likelihood of claims differences, the differences in the number of payments that the borrower has made prior to default and the sponsor of the securitization.  
  Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from the Corporation s assumptions in its predictive models, including, without limitation, those regarding the ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, economic conditions, home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, and a variety of judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of loss. For example, if courts were to disagree with the Corporation s interpretation that the underlying agreements require a claimant to prove that the representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss, it could significantly impact this estimated range of possible loss. For additional information, see   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  . Additionally, if recent court rulings related to monoline litigation, including one related to the Corporation, that have allowed sampling of loan files instead of requiring a loan-by-loan review to determine if a representations and warranties breach has occurred are followed generally by the courts, private-label securitization investors may view litigation as a more attractive alternative as compared to a loan-by-loan review. Finally, although the Corporation believes that the representations and warranties typically given in non-GSE transactions are less rigorous and actionable than those given in GSE transactions, the Corporation does not have significant loan-level experience in non-GSE transactions to measure the impact of these differences on the probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased. 
  The liability for obligations under representations and warranties with respect to GSE and non-GSE exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties exposures does not include any losses related to litigation matters disclosed in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  , nor do they include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs, assessments and compensatory fees or any possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations (except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon Settlement), potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against the Corporation, including claims related to loans insured by the FHA. The Corporation is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities law (except to the extent reflected in the aggregate range of possible loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  ), fraud or other claims against the Corporation; however, such loss could be material. 
  Government-sponsored Enterprises Experience 
  The Corporation and its subsidiaries have an established history of working with the GSEs on repurchase claims. However, the GSEs  repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase  

requests, and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with GSEs  prior conduct and the Corporation s interpretation of its contractual obligations. Notably, in recent periods, the Corporation has been experiencing elevated levels of new claims, including claims on loans on which borrowers have made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least   25   payments) or on loans which had defaulted more than   18   months prior to the repurchase request, in each case, in numbers that were not expected based on historical experience. Additionally, the criteria and the processes by which the GSEs are ultimately willing to resolve claims have changed in ways that are unfavorable to the Corporation. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. The Corporation intends to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern its relationship with the GSEs. For additional information, see   Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices   in this Note on page   208  .  
  Generally, the Corporation first becomes aware that a GSE is evaluating a particular loan for repurchase when the Corporation receives a request from a GSE to review the underlying loan file (file request). Upon completing its review, the GSE may submit a repurchase claim to the Corporation. As soon as practicable after receiving a repurchase claim from either of the GSEs, the Corporation evaluates the claim and takes appropriate action. Claim disputes are generally handled through loan-level negotiations with the GSEs and the Corporation seeks to resolve the repurchase claim within   90 to 120   days of the receipt of the claim although tolerances exist for claims that remain open beyond this timeframe. Disputes include reasonableness of stated income, occupancy, undisclosed liabilities, and the validity of MI claim rescissions in the vintages with the highest default rates. 
  Monoline Insurers Experience 
  Experience with most of the monoline insurers has been varied and the protocols and experience with these counterparties has not been predictable. The timetable for the loan file request, the repurchase claim, if any, response and resolution vary by monoline. Where a breach of representations and warranties given by the Corporation or subsidiaries or legacy companies is confirmed on a given loan, settlement is generally reached as to that loan within   60 to 90   days. 
  The Corporation generally reviews properly presented repurchase claims from the monolines on a loan-by-loan basis. As part of an ongoing claims process, if the Corporation does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally indicate the reason for the denial to facilitate meaningful dialogue with the counterparty although it is not contractually obligated to do so. When there is disagreement as to the resolution of a claim, meaningful dialogue and negotiation is generally necessary between the parties to reach conclusion on an individual claim. Although the Assured Guaranty Settlement does not cover all securitizations where Assured Guaranty and subsidiaries provided insurance, it covers the transactions that resulted in repurchase requests from this monoline. As a result, the on-going claims process with counterparties with a more consistent repurchase experience is substantially complete. 
  The remaining monolines have instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America. When claims from these counterparties are denied, the Corporation does not indicate its reason for denial as it is not contractually obligated to do so. In the Corporation s experience, the monolines have been generally  

Table of Contents  

     unwilling to withdraw repurchase claims, regardless of whether and what evidence was offered to refute a claim. 
  The pipeline of unresolved monoline claims where the Corporation believes a valid defect has not been identified which would constitute an actionable breach of representations and warranties decreased during   2011   as a result of the Assured Guaranty Settlement. Through   December 31, 2011  , approximately   30 percent   of monoline claims that the Corporation initially denied have subsequently been resolved through the Assured Guaranty Settlement,   10 percent   through repurchase or make-whole payments and   one percent   through rescission. When a claim has been denied and there has not been communication with the counterparty for six months, the Corporation views these claims as inactive; however, they remain in the outstanding claims balance until resolution. 
  To the extent there are repurchase claims based on valid identified loan defects and for repurchase claims that are in the process of review, a liability for representations and warranties is established. For repurchase claims in the process of review, the liability is based on historical repurchase experience with specific monoline insurers to the extent such experience provides a reasonable basis on which to estimate incurred losses from repurchase activity. In prior periods, a liability was established for Assured Guaranty related to repurchase claims subject to negotiation and unasserted claims to repurchase current and future defaulted loans. The Assured Guaranty Settlement resolved this representations and warranties liability with the liability for the related loss sharing reinsurance arrangement being recorded in other accrued liabilities. With respect to the other monoline insurers, the Corporation has had limited experience in the repurchase process as these monoline insurers have instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America, which limits the Corporation s ability to enter into constructive dialogue with these monolines to resolve the open claims. For these monolines, in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of those repurchase claims where a valid defect has not been identified or in predicting future claim requests and the related outcome in the case of unasserted claims to repurchase loans from the securitization trusts in which these monolines have insured all or some of the related bonds, the Corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome through the repurchase process. In addition, the timing of the ultimate resolution or the eventual loss through the repurchase process, if any, related to those repurchase claims cannot be reasonably estimated. Thus, with respect to these monolines, a liability for representations and warranties has not been established related to repurchase claims where a valid defect has not been identified, or in the case of any unasserted claims to repurchase loans from the securitization trusts in which such monolines have insured all or some of the related bonds. For additional information related to the monolines, see   Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  . 
  Monoline Outstanding Claims 
  At   December 31, 2011  , for loans originated between   2004   and   2008  , the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase claims was   $3.1 billion  , substantially all of which the Corporation has reviewed and declined to repurchase based on an assessment of whether a material breach exists. As noted above, a portion of the repurchase claims that are initially denied are ultimately resolved through bulk settlement, repurchase or make-whole payments, after additional dialogue and negotiation with the monoline insurer. At   December 31, 2011  , the  

unpaid principal balance of loans in these vintages for which the monolines had requested loan files for review but for which no repurchase claim had been received was   $6.1 billion  , excluding loans that had been paid in full and file requests for loans included in the trusts settled with Assured Guaranty. There will likely be additional requests for loan files in the future leading to repurchase claims. Such claims may relate to loans that are currently in securitization trusts or loans that have defaulted and are no longer included in the unpaid principal balance of the loans in the trusts. However, it is unlikely that a repurchase claim will be received for every loan in a securitization or every file requested or that a valid defect exists for every loan repurchase claim. In addition, amounts paid on repurchase claims from a monoline are paid to the securitization trust and are applied in accordance with the terms of the governing securitization documents which may include use by the securitization trust to repay any outstanding monoline advances or reduce future advances from the monolines. To the extent that a monoline has not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it will be required to advance funds to the securitization trust, the likelihood of receiving a repurchase claim from a monoline may be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no benefit from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some monolines are not currently performing their obligations under the financial guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims, although in those circumstances, investors may be able to bring claims if contractual thresholds are met. 
  Whole Loan Sales and Private-label Securitizations Experience 
  The majority of the repurchase claims that the Corporation has received outside of those from the GSEs and monolines are from third-party whole-loan investors. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation provided representations and warranties and the whole-loan investors may retain those rights even when the loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. The Corporation reviews properly presented repurchase claims for these whole loans on a loan-by-loan basis. If, after the Corporation s review, it does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally indicate a reason for the denial. When the counterparty agrees with the Corporation s denial of the claim, the counterparty may rescind the claim. When there is disagreement as to the resolution of the claim, meaningful dialogue and negotiation between the parties is generally necessary to reach conclusion on an individual claim. Generally, a whole-loan sale claimant is engaged in the repurchase process and the Corporation and the claimant reach resolution, either through loan-by-loan negotiation or at times, through a bulk settlement. Through   December 31, 2011  ,   25 percent   of the whole-loan claims that the Corporation initially denied have subsequently been resolved through repurchase or make-whole payments and   50 percent   have been resolved through rescission or repayment in full by the borrower. Although the timeline for resolution varies, once an actionable breach is identified on a given loan, settlement is generally reached as to that loan within   60 to 90   days. When a claim has been denied and the Corporation does not have communication with the counterparty for six months, the Corporation views these claims as inactive; however, they remain in the outstanding claims balance until resolution. 
  In private-label securitizations, certain presentation thresholds  

Table of Contents  

     need to be met in order for any repurchase claim to be asserted by investors. In   2011  , there was an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet the required standards. During   2011  , the Corporation received   $2.1 billion   of such repurchase claims. In addition, there has been an increase in requests for loan files from private-label securitization trustees, as well as requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statutes of limitation relating to representations and warranties claims, and the Corporation believes it is likely that these requests will lead to an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet required standards. The representations and warranties, as governed by the private-label securitization agreements, generally require that counterparties have the ability to both assert a claim and actually prove that a loan has an actionable defect under the applicable contracts. While the Corporation believes the agreements for private-label securitizations generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties and place higher burdens on investors seeking repurchases than the express provisions of comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs, the agreements generally include a representation that underwriting practices were prudent and customary. 
  During 2010, the Corporation received claim demands totaling   $1.7 billion   from private-label securitization investors in the Covered Trusts. Non-GSE investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of the loans directly or the right to access loan files. The inclusion of the   $1.7 billion   in outstanding claims, as reflected in the table on page   208  , does not mean that the Corporation believes these claims have satisfied the contractual thresholds required for the private-label securitization investors to direct the securitization trustee to take action or that these claims are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid. One of these claimants has filed litigation against the Corporation relating to certain of these claims; the claims in this litigation would be extinguished if there is final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement. 
    NOTE 10   Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill 
  The Goodwill table presents goodwill balances by business segment at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . The reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment tests are the business segments or one level below. The majority of the decline in goodwill during   2011   was due to goodwill impairment charges as described in this Note. 

International Consumer Card Businesses  
  In connection with the Corporation s announcement on August 15, 2011 of its intention to exit the international consumer card businesses, goodwill of approximately   $1.9 billion   was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, from   Card Services   to   All Other   as of September 30, 2011. Of the   $1.9 billion   of goodwill allocated to the international consumer card businesses,   $526 million   of goodwill was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, to the Canadian consumer card business which was sold on December 1, 2011. 
  During the three months ended December 31, 2011, a goodwill impairment test was performed for the European consumer card businesses reporting unit as it was likely that the carrying amount of the businesses exceeded the fair value due to a decrease in estimated future growth projections. The Corporation concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of   $581 million   for the European consumer card businesses. 
  Consumer Real Estate Services 
  In connection with the sale of Balboa Insurance Company s lender-placed insurance business on June 1, 2011, the Corporation allocated, on a relative fair value basis,   $193 million   of   CRES   goodwill to the business in determining the gain on the sale. 
  During the three months ended June 30, 2011, as a consequence of the BNY Mellon Settlement entered into by the Corporation on June 28, 2011, the adverse impact of the incremental mortgage-related charges, and the continued economic slowdown in the mortgage business, the Corporation performed a goodwill impairment test for the   CRES   reporting unit. The Corporation concluded that the remaining balance of goodwill of   $2.6 billion   was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in   CRES   to   zero  . 
  2011   Annual Impairment Test 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2011, the Corporation completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2011 for all reporting units. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Corporation determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment. 
  2010 Impairment Tests 
  In 2010, the Corporation performed a goodwill impairment test for   Card Services   due to the continued stress on the business and the uncertain debit card interchange provisions under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act). The Corporation concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of   $10.4 billion   to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in   Card Services  . 

Table of Contents  

     During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Corporation performed a goodwill impairment test for the   CRES   reporting unit as it was likely that there was a decline in its fair value as a result of increased uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation exposure and other related risks, higher servicing costs including those related to loss mitigation, foreclosure related issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources. The Corporation concluded that goodwill was  

impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of   $2.0 billion   in   CRES  . 
  Intangible Assets 
  The table below presents the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization related to intangible assets at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . 

Excluded from   2011   amounts are   $3.2 billion   of fully amortized intangible assets and   $396 million   of intangible assets sold as part of the consumer credit card portfolio sales that occurred during the year. 
  None of the intangible assets were impaired at   December 31, 2011   or   2010  . Amortization of intangibles expense was   $1.5  

billion  ,   $1.7 billion   and   $2.0 billion   in   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , respectively. The Corporation estimates aggregate amortization expense will be approximately   $1.3 billion  ,   $1.1 billion  ,   $1.0 billion  ,   $870 million   and   $770 million   for   2012   through   2016  , respectively. 

NOTE 11   Deposits 
  The Corporation had U.S. certificates of deposit and other U.S. time deposits of $100 thousand or more totaling   $50.8 billion   and   $60.5 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . Non-U.S. certificates of deposit and other non-U.S. time deposits of $100 thousand or more totaled   $34.0 billion   and   $40.6 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . The table below presents the contractual maturities for time deposits of $100 thousand or more at   December 31, 2011  . 

The scheduled contractual maturities for total time deposits at   December 31, 2011   are presented in the table below.

    Bank of America, N.A. maintains a global program to offer up to a maximum of   $75 billion   outstanding at any one time, of bank notes with fixed or floating rates and maturities of at least seven days from the date of issue. Short-term bank notes outstanding under this program totaled   $1.4 billion   and   $14.6 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . These short-term bank notes,  

along with Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and term federal funds purchased, are included in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See   Note 13   Long-term Debt   for information regarding the long-term notes that have been issued under the   $75 billion   bank note program.

   NOTE 13   Long-term Debt 
  Long-term debt consists of borrowings having an original maturity of one year or more. The table below presents the balance of long-term debt at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , and the related contractual rates and maturity dates at   December 31, 2011  . 

Bank of America Corporation, Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. and subsidiaries, and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various U.S. and non-U.S. debt programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the amount of foreign currency-denominated debt translated into U.S. dollars included in total long-term debt was   $117.0 billion   and   $145.9 billion  . Foreign currency contracts are used to convert certain  

foreign currency-denominated debt into U.S. dollars.  
  At   December 31, 2011  , long-term debt of consolidated VIEs included credit card, automobile, home equity and other VIEs of   $33.1 billion  ,   $2.9 billion  ,   $3.1 billion   and   $10.0 billion  , respectively. Long-term debt of VIEs is collateralized by the assets of the VIEs. For more information, see   Note 8   Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities  .   The majority of the floating rates are based on three- and six-month LIBOR. 

Table of Contents  

     At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , Bank of America Corporation had approximately   $69.8 billion   and   $88.4 billion   of authorized, but unissued corporate debt and other securities under its existing U.S. shelf registration statements. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , Bank of America, N.A. had approximately   $67.3 billion   and   $53.3 billion   of authorized, but unissued bank notes under its existing   $75 billion   bank note program. Long-term bank notes issued and outstanding under the program totaled   $6.3 billion   and   $7.1 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . At both   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , Bank of America, N.A. had approximately   $20.6 billion   of authorized, but unissued mortgage notes under its   $30.0 billion   mortgage bond program. 
  The weighted-average effective interest rates for total long-term debt (excluding senior structured notes), total fixed-rate debt and total floating-rate debt, were   4.35 percent  ,   5.17 percent   and   1.38 percent  , respectively, at   December 31, 2011   and   3.96 percent  ,   5.02 percent   and   1.09 percent  , respectively, at   December 31, 2010  . The Corporation s ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest  

rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The above weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions. 
  The weighted-average interest rate for debt, excluding senior structured notes, issued by Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. and subsidiaries was   4.74 percent   and   4.11 percent   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . As of   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation has not assumed or guaranteed the   $105.6 billion   of long-term debt that was issued or guaranteed by Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. or its subsidiaries prior to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by the Corporation. All existing Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. guarantees of securities issued by certain Merrill Lynch subsidiaries under various non-U.S. securities offering programs will remain in full force and effect as long as those securities are outstanding, and the Corporation has not assumed any of those prior Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. guarantees or otherwise guaranteed such securities. 
  Certain senior structured notes are accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on these senior structured notes, see   Note 23   Fair Value Option  . 
  The table below represents the carrying value for aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at   December 31, 2011  . 

Included in the above table are certain structured notes that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified dates prior to maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a referenced index or security. In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the above table as maturing at their earliest put or redemption date. 
  Trust Preferred and Hybrid Securities 
  Trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are primarily issued by trust companies (the Trusts) that are not consolidated. These Trust Securities are mandatorily redeemable preferred security obligations of the Trusts. The sole assets of the Trusts generally are junior subordinated deferrable interest notes of the Corporation or its subsidiaries (the Notes). The Trusts generally are 100 percent-owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation. Obligations associated with the Notes are included in the long-term debt table on page   216  .  
  Certain of the Trust Securities were issued at a discount and may be redeemed prior to maturity at the option of the Corporation. The Trusts generally have invested the proceeds of such Trust Securities in the Notes. Each issue of the Notes has an interest rate equal to the corresponding Trust Securities distribution rate.  

The Corporation has the right to defer payment of interest on the Notes at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding five years provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the relevant Notes. During any such extension period, distributions on the Trust Securities will also be deferred and the Corporation s ability to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock will be restricted. 
  The Trust Securities generally are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the related Notes at their stated maturity dates or their earlier redemption at a redemption price equal to their liquidation amount plus accrued distributions to the date fixed for redemption and the premium, if any, paid by the Corporation upon concurrent repayment of the related Notes. 
  Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or redemption with respect to Trust Securities are guaranteed by the Corporation or its subsidiaries to the extent of funds held by the Trusts (the Preferred Securities Guarantee). The Preferred Securities Guarantee, when taken together with the Corporation s other obligations including its obligations under the Notes, generally will constitute a full and unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, by the Corporation of payments due on the Trust Securities. 
  Hybrid Income Term Securities (HITS) totaling   $1.6 billion   were issued by the Trusts to institutional investors during 2007. The BAC Capital Trust XIII Floating-Rate Preferred HITS had a distribution rate of   three-month LIBOR   plus   40   bps and the BAC Capital Trust XIV Fixed-to-Floating Rate Preferred HITS had an initial distribution rate of   5.63 percent  . Both series of HITS represent  

Table of Contents  

     beneficial interests in the assets of the respective capital trust, which consist of a series of the Corporation s junior subordinated notes and a stock purchase contract for a specified series of the Corporation s preferred stock. The Corporation will remarket the junior subordinated notes underlying each series of HITS on or about the five-year anniversary of the issuance to obtain sufficient funds for the capital trusts to buy the Corporation s preferred stock under the stock purchase contracts. Following the successful remarketing of the notes and the subsequent purchase of the Corporation s preferred stock under the stock purchase contracts, the preferred stock will constitute the sole asset of the applicable trust. 
  In connection with the HITS, the Corporation entered into two replacement capital covenants for the benefit of investors in certain series of the Corporation s long-term indebtedness (Covered Debt). As of   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation s   6.625%   Junior Subordinated Notes due   2036   constitute the Covered Debt under the covenant corresponding to the Floating-Rate Preferred HITS and the Corporation s   5.625%   Junior Subordinated Notes due   2035   constitute the Covered Debt under the covenant corresponding to the Fixed-to-Floating Rate Preferred HITS. These covenants generally restrict the ability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to redeem or purchase the HITS and related securities unless the Corporation has obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if required under the Federal Reserve s capital guidelines, the redemption or purchase price of the HITS does not exceed the amount received by the Corporation from the sale of certain qualifying securities, and such replacement securities qualify as Tier 1 capital and are not  restricted core capital elements  under the Federal Reserve s guidelines. 
  In 2011, as part of the exchange agreements described in   Note 15   Shareholders  Equity  , the Corporation issued   282 million   shares of common stock valued at   $1.6 billion   and senior notes valued at   $1.5 billion   in exchange for   $3.8 billion   aggregate liquidation amount of previously issued Trust Securities. Upon the exchange, the Corporation immediately surrendered the Trust Securities to the unconsolidated Trusts for cancellation, resulting in the cancellation of an equal amount of junior subordinated notes that had a carrying value of   $4.3 billion  , resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $1.2 billion  . In addition, the Corporation issued   26 million   shares of common stock valued at   $138 million   and senior notes valued at   $505 million   in exchange for   $917 million   aggregate liquidation amount of HITS. Upon the exchange, the Corporation immediately surrendered the HITS to the unconsolidated Trusts for cancellation, resulting in the cancellation of an equal amount of junior subordinated notes that had a carrying value of   $915 million  , and the cancellation of a corresponding amount of the underlying stock purchase contract, resulting in a  

$12 million   loss on extinguishment of debt and an increase to additional paid-in capital of   $284 million  . For additional information regarding these exchanges, see   Note 15   Shareholders  Equity  . 
  The table below lists each series of Trust Securities or HITS, and the corresponding aggregate liquidation preference covered by the Exchange Agreements.

     NOTE 14   Commitments and Contingencies 
  In the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  Credit Extension Commitments 
  The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLC and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The table below includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated) to other financial institutions of   $27.1 billion   and   $23.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . At   December 31, 2011  , the  

carrying amount of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was   $741 million  , including deferred revenue of   $27 million   and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of   $714 million  . At   December 31, 2010  , the comparable amounts were   $1.2 billion  ,   $29 million   and   $1.2 billion  , respectively. The carrying amount of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments of   $25.7 billion   and   $27.3 billion   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table below excludes fair value adjustments of   $1.2 billion   and   $866 million   on these commitments, which are classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For information regarding the Corporation s loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see   Note 23   Fair Value Option  . 

(2)    
    Includes business card unused lines of credit. 
        Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower s ability to pay. 
  Other Commitments 
  Global Principal Investments and Other Equity Investments 
  At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of   $772 million   and   $1.5 billion  . In light of proposed Basel regulatory capital changes related to unfunded commitments over the past two years, the Corporation has actively reduced these commitments in a series of sale transactions involving its private equity fund investments.  

Other Commitments 
  At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of   $2.5 billion   and   $2.6 billion   which upon settlement will be included in loans or LHFS. 
  At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation had commitments to enter into forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of   $67.0 billion   and   $39.4 billion  . In addition, the Corporation had commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of   $42.0 billion   and   $33.5 billion  . All of these commitments expire within the next 12 months. 
  The Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of its premises and equipment. Commitments under these leases are approximately   $3.0 billion  ,   $2.6 billion  ,   $2.0 billion  ,   $1.6 billion   and   $1.3 billion   for   2012   through   2016  , respectively, and   $6.1 billion   in the aggregate for all years thereafter. 

Table of Contents  

     The Corporation has entered into agreements with providers of market data, communications, systems consulting and other office-related services. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the minimum fee commitments over the remaining terms of these agreements totaled   $1.9 billion   and   $2.1 billion  . 
  Other Guarantees 
  Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection 
  The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. The book value protection is provided on portfolios of intermediate investment-grade fixed-income securities and is intended to cover any shortfall in the event that policyholders surrender their policies and market value is below book value. To manage its exposure, the Corporation imposes significant restrictions on surrenders and the manner in which the portfolio is liquidated and the funds are accessed. In addition, investment parameters of the underlying portfolio are restricted. These constraints, combined with structural protections, including a cap on the amount of risk assumed on each policy, are designed to provide adequate buffers and guard against payments even under extreme stress scenarios. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At both   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the notional amount of these guarantees totaled   $15.8 billion   and the Corporation s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled   $5.1 billion   and   $5.0 billion   with estimated maturity dates between 2030 and 2040. As of   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation had not made a payment under these products. The possibility of surrender or other payment associated with these guarantees exists. The net fair value of the liability associated with these guarantees was   $48 million   and   $78 million   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010   and reflects the probability of surrender as well as the multiple structural protection features in the contracts.  
  Employee Retirement Protection 
  The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection primarily to plan sponsors of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governed pension plans, such as 401(k) plans and 457 plans. The book value protection is provided on portfolios of intermediate/short-term investment-grade fixed-income securities and is intended to cover any shortfall in the event that plan participants continue to withdraw funds after all securities have been liquidated and there is remaining book value. The Corporation retains the option to exit the contract at any time. If the Corporation exercises its option, the purchaser can require the Corporation to purchase high-quality fixed-income securities, typically government or government-backed agency securities, with the proceeds of the liquidated assets to assure the return of principal. To manage its exposure, the Corporation imposes significant restrictions and constraints on the timing of the withdrawals, the manner in which the portfolio is liquidated and the funds are accessed, and the investment parameters of the underlying portfolio. These constraints, combined with structural protections, are designed to provide adequate buffers and guard against payments even under extreme stress scenarios. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the notional amount of these guarantees totaled   $28.8 billion   and   $33.8 billion   with estimated maturity dates up to 2015 if the exit  

option is exercised on all deals. As of   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation had not made a payment under these products. 
  Indemnifications 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of the early termination clause. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote. 
  Merchant Services 
  During 2009, the Corporation contributed its merchant services business to a joint venture in exchange for a   46.5 percent   ownership interest in the joint venture. In 2010, the joint venture purchased the interest held by one of the three initial investors bringing the Corporation s ownership interest up to   49 percent  . For additional information on the joint venture agreement, see   Note 5   Securities  . 
  In accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants. In connection with these services, a liability may arise in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder s favor. If the merchant defaults on its obligation to reimburse the cardholder, the cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until six months after the date of the transaction to present a chargeback to the merchant processor, which is primarily liable for any losses on covered transactions. However, if the merchant processor fails to meet its obligation to reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the Corporation, as the sponsor, could be held liable for the disputed amount. In   2011   and   2010  , the sponsored entities processed and settled   $460.4 billion   and   $339.4 billion   of transactions and recorded losses of   $11 million   and   $17 million  . At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation held as collateral   $238 million   and   $25 million   of merchant escrow deposits which may be used to offset amounts due from the individual merchants.  
  The Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure. The Corporation believes the maximum potential exposure for chargebacks would not exceed the total amount of merchant transactions processed through Visa, MasterCard and Discover for the last six months, which represents the claim period for the cardholder, plus any outstanding delayed-delivery transactions. As of   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the maximum potential exposure for sponsored transactions totaled approximately   $236.0 billion

     and   $139.5 billion  . The Corporation does not expect to make material payments in connection with these guarantees. 
  Other Derivative Contracts 
  The Corporation funds selected assets, including securities issued by CDOs and CLOs, through derivative contracts, typically total return swaps, with third parties and VIEs that are not consolidated on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the total notional amount of these derivative contracts was approximately   $3.2 billion   and   $4.3 billion   with commercial banks and   $1.8 billion   and   $1.7 billion   with VIEs. The underlying securities are senior securities and substantially all of the Corporation s exposures are insured. Accordingly, the Corporation s exposure to loss consists principally of counterparty risk to the insurers. In certain circumstances, generally as a result of ratings downgrades, the Corporation may be required to purchase the underlying assets, which would not result in additional gain or loss to the Corporation as such exposure is already reflected in the fair value of the derivative contracts. 
  Other Guarantees 
  The Corporation sells products that guarantee the return of principal to investors at a preset future date. These guarantees cover a broad range of underlying asset classes and are designed to cover the shortfall between the market value of the underlying portfolio and the principal amount on the preset future date. To manage its exposure, the Corporation requires that these guarantees be backed by structural and investment constraints and certain pre-defined triggers that would require the underlying assets or portfolio to be liquidated and invested in zero-coupon bonds that mature at the preset future date. The Corporation is required to fund any shortfall between the proceeds of the liquidated assets and the purchase price of the zero-coupon bonds at the preset future date. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the notional amount of these guarantees totaled   $300 million   and   $666 million  . These guarantees have various maturities ranging from two to five years. As of   December 31, 2011 and 2010  , the Corporation had not made a payment under these products and has assessed the probability of payments under these guarantees as remote. 
  The Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, sold risk participation swaps, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these agreements was approximately   $3.7 billion   and   $3.4 billion   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2033. The Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees. 
  In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non ISDA-related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions. 

Payment Protection Insurance Claims Matter 
  In the U.K., the Corporation sells payment protection insurance (PPI) through its international card services business to credit card customers and has previously sold this insurance to consumer loan customers. PPI covers a consumer s loan for debt repayment if certain events occur such as loss of job or illness. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints of misleading sales tactics across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints relating to the sale of these insurance policies. In August 2010, the FSA issued a policy statement (the FSA Policy Statement) on the assessment and remediation of PPI claims that is applicable to the Corporation s U.K. consumer businesses and is intended to address concerns among consumers and regulators regarding the handling of PPI complaints across the industry. The FSA Policy Statement sets standards for the sale of PPI that apply to current and prior sales, and in the event a company does not or did not comply with the standards, it is alleged that the insurance was incorrectly sold, giving the customer rights to remedies. The FSA Policy Statement also requires companies to review their sales practices and to proactively remediate non-complaining customers if evidence of a systematic breach of the newly articulated sales standards is discovered, which could include refunding premiums paid. 
  In October 2010, the British Bankers  Association (BBA), on behalf of its members, including the Corporation, challenged the provisions of the FSA Policy Statement and its retroactive application to sales of PPI to U.K. consumers through a judicial review process against the FSA and the U.K. Financial Ombudsman Service. On April 20, 2011, the U.K. court issued a judgment upholding the FSA Policy Statement as promulgated and dismissing the BBA s challenge. The BBA did not appeal the decision. Following the conclusion of the judicial review and the subsequent completion of the detailed root cause analysis as required by the FSA Policy Statement, the Corporation reassessed its reserve for PPI claims during 2010. The total accrued liability was   $476 million   and   $700 million   at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . 
  Litigation and Regulatory Matters 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, environmental, banking, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations. Certain subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered broker/dealers or investment advisors and are subject to regulation by  

Table of Contents  

     the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the New York Stock Exchange, the FSA and other domestic, international and state securities regulators. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by those agencies, such subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities. 
  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be. 
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal or external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of   $5.6 billion   was recognized for   2011   compared to   $2.6 billion   for   2010  . 
  For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of possible loss is   $0   to   $3.6 billion   in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown  

uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, this estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation s maximum loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described herein, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation s results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 
  Auction Rate Securities Litigation 
  Since October 2007, the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have been named as defendants in a variety of lawsuits and other proceedings brought by customers and both individual and institutional investors regarding auction rate securities (ARS). These actions generally allege that defendants: (i) misled plaintiffs into believing that there was a deeply liquid market for ARS, and (ii) failed to adequately disclose their or their affiliates  practice of placing their own bids to support ARS auctions. Plaintiffs assert that ARS auctions started failing from August 2007 through February 2008 when defendants and other broker/dealers stopped placing those  support bids.  In addition to the matters described in more detail below, numerous arbitrations and individual lawsuits have been filed against the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates by parties who purchased ARS and are seeking relief that includes compensatory and punitive damages totaling in excess of   $1.2 billion  , as well as rescission, among other relief. 
  Securities Actions 
  The Corporation and Merrill Lynch face a number of civil actions relating to the sales of ARS and management of ARS auctions, including two putative class action lawsuits in which plaintiffs seek to recover the alleged losses in market value of ARS securities purportedly caused by defendants  actions. Plaintiffs also seek unspecified damages, including rescission, other compensatory and consequential damages, costs, fees and interest. The first action,   In Re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Securities Litigation  , is the result of the consolidation of two class action suits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. These suits were brought by two Merrill Lynch customers on behalf of all persons who purchased ARS in auctions managed by Merrill Lynch, against Merrill Lynch and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated (MLPF S). On March 31, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Merrill Lynch s motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs appealed and on November 14, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court s dismissal. Plaintiffs  time to seek a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court expired on February 13, 2012, and, as a result,  

Table of Contents  

     this action is now concluded. The second action,   Bondar v. Bank of America Corporation  , was brought by a putative class of ARS purchasers against the Corporation and Banc of America Securities, LLC (BAS). On February 24, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the amended complaint and directed plaintiffs to state whether they will file a further amended complaint or appeal the court s dismissal. Following the Second Circuit s decision in   In Re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Securities Litigation  , plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their action on January 4, 2012. The dismissal is subject to the district court s approval. 
  Antitrust Actions 
  The Corporation, Merrill Lynch and other financial institutions were also named in two putative antitrust class actions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs in both actions assert federal antitrust claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on allegations that defendants conspired to restrain trade in ARS by placing support bids in ARS auctions, only to collectively withdraw those bids in February 2008, which allegedly caused ARS auctions to fail. In the first action,   Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland v. Citigroup, Inc., et al.  , plaintiff seeks to represent a class of issuers of ARS that defendants underwrote between May 12, 2003 and February 13, 2008. This issuer action seeks to recover, among other relief, the alleged above-market interest payments that ARS issuers allegedly have had to make after defendants allegedly stopped placing  support bids  in ARS auctions. In the second action,   Mayfield, et al. v. Citigroup, Inc., et al.  , plaintiff seeks to represent a class of investors that purchased ARS from defendants and held those securities when ARS auctions failed on February 13, 2008. Plaintiff seeks to recover, among other relief, unspecified damages for losses in the ARS  market value, and rescission of the investors  ARS purchases. Both actions also seek treble damages and attorneys  fees under the Sherman Act s private civil remedy. On January 25, 2010, the court dismissed both actions with prejudice and plaintiffs  respective appeals are currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
  Checking Account Overdraft Litigation 
  Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) is currently a defendant in several consumer suits challenging certain deposit account-related business practices. Four suits are part of a multi-district litigation proceeding (the MDL) involving approximately 65 individual cases against 30 financial institutions assigned by the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation (JPML) to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The four cases:   Tornes v. Bank of America, N.A.; Yourke, et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., et al.  ;   Knighten v. Bank of America, N.A.;   and   Phillips, et al. v. Bank of America, N.A.;   allege that BANA improperly and unfairly increased the number of overdraft fees it assessed on consumer deposit accounts by various means. The cases challenge the practice of reordering debit card transactions to post high-to-low and BANA s failure to notify customers at the point of sale that the transaction may result in an overdraft charge. The cases also allege that BANA s disclosures and advertising regarding the posting of debit card transactions are false, deceptive and misleading. These cases assert claims including breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, unjust enrichment and violation of the unfair and deceptive practices statutes of various states. Plaintiffs generally seek restitution of all overdraft fees paid to  

BANA as a result of BANA s allegedly wrongful business practices, as well as disgorgement, punitive damages, injunctive relief, pre-judgment interest and attorneys  fees. Omnibus motions to dismiss many of the complaints involved in the MDL, including   Tornes, Yourke   and   Knighten  , were denied on March 12, 2010. 
  Knighten   was dismissed without prejudice on February 4, 2011. On November 22, 2011, the MDL court granted final approval of a settlement of all the remaining class matters in the MDL (including   Tornes, Yourke and Phillips  ), providing for a payment by the Corporation of   $410 million   (which amount was fully accrued by the Corporation, as of   December 31, 2011  ) in exchange for a complete release of claims asserted against the Corporation in the MDL. Several MDL settlement class members have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit from the judgment granting final approval to the settlement. 
  Countrywide Bond Insurance Litigation  
  The Corporation, Countrywide Financial Corporation (CFC) and other Countrywide entities are subject to claims from several monoline bond insurance companies. These claims generally relate to bond insurance policies provided by the insurers on securitized pools of home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. Plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that they have paid claims as a result of defaults in the underlying loans and assert that these defaults are the result of improper underwriting by defendants. 
  Ambac 
  The Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in an action filed by Ambac Assurance Corporation (Ambac) entitled   Ambac Assurance Corporation and The Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., et al.   This action, currently pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to bond insurance policies provided by Ambac on certain securitized pools of HELOC and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. On September 8, 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which asserts claims involving five additional securitizations of first- and second-lien mortgage loans and alleges fraudulent inducement, breach of contract as well as other claims set forth in the initial complaint. The amended complaint also reasserts a claim that the Corporation is jointly and severally liable as the successor to Countrywide. The amended complaint seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages and equitable relief.  
  FGIC 
  The Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in an action filed by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC) entitled   Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc  . This action, currently pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to bond insurance policies provided by FGIC on securitized pools of HELOC and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. In June 2010, the court entered an order that granted in part and denied in part the Countrywide defendants  motion to dismiss. On April 30, 2010, FGIC filed an amended complaint reasserting claims set forth in the initial complaint and asserting a claim that the Corporation is jointly and severally liable as the successor to Countrywide. In October 2011, following the appellate court s June 30, 2011 order on the cross-appeals in   MBIA Insurance Corporation, Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, et al.  , the parties entered a joint stipulated order  

Table of Contents  

     withdrawing cross-appeals from the court s June 2010 order. 
  On March 24, 2010, CFC and other Countrywide entities filed a separate but related action against FGIC in New York Supreme Court seeking monetary damages of at least   $100 million   against FGIC in connection with FGIC s failure to pay claims under certain bond insurance policies. The same day, CFC and the other Countrywide entities filed an action to enjoin the instruction of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) to FGIC to suspend payments claimed under various insurance agreements or its approval of FGIC s plan to do so. This action is currently being voluntarily deferred at the request of the NYSDFS. 
  MBIA 
  The Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in two actions filed by MBIA Insurance Corporation (MBIA). The first action,   MBIA Insurance Corporation, Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, et al.  , is pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County. In April 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part the Countrywide defendants  motion to dismiss and denied the Corporation s motion to dismiss. The parties filed cross-appeals. On December 22, 2010, the court issued an order on MBIA s motion for use of sampling at trial, in which the court held that MBIA may attempt to prove its breach of contract and fraudulent inducement claims through examination of statistically significant samples of the securitizations at issue. In its order, the court did not endorse any of MBIA s specific sampling proposals and stated that defendants have  significant valid challenges  to MBIA s methodology that they may present at trial, together with defendants  own views and evidence. On June 30, 2011, the appellate court issued a decision on the parties  cross-appeals. The appellate court dismissed MBIA s breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, which reversed the trial court ruling on that claim, and otherwise affirmed the trial court s decisions.  
  On May 25, 2011, MBIA moved for partial summary judgment, seeking rulings that: (i) MBIA does not have to show that Countrywide s alleged fraud and breaches of contract proximately caused MBIA s losses; and (ii) the term  materially and adversely affects  in the transaction documents does not limit the repurchase remedy to defaulted loans, or require MBIA to show that Countrywide s breaches of the representations and warranties caused the loans to default. On January 3, 2012, the court issued an order that granted in part and denied in part MBIA s motion. The court ruled that under New York insurance law, MBIA does not need to prove a causal link between Countrywide s alleged misrepresentations and the payments made pursuant to the policies. The court also held that plaintiff could recover  rescissory damages  (the amounts it has been required to pay pursuant to the policies less premiums received) on such claims, but must prove that it was damaged as a direct result of Countrywide s alleged material misrepresentations. The court denied the motion in its entirety on the issue of the interpretation of the  materially and adversely affects  language. On January 25, 2012, Countrywide appealed the court s decision and order to the extent it granted MBIA s motion. On February 6, 2012, MBIA filed a cross-appeal of the court s decision and order to the extent it denied MBIA s motion. 
  The second MBIA action,   MBIA Insurance Corporation, Inc. v. Bank of America Corporation, Countrywide Financial Corporation, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., Countrywide Securities Corporation,  

et al.  , is pending in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. MBIA purports to bring this action as subrogee to the note holders for certain securitized pools of HELOC and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans and seeks unspecified damages and declaratory relief. On May 17, 2010, the court dismissed the claims against the Countrywide defendants with leave to amend, but denied the request to dismiss MBIA s successor liability claims against the Corporation. On June 21, 2010, MBIA filed an amended complaint re-asserting its previously dismissed claims against the Countrywide defendants, re-asserting the successor liability claim against the Corporation and adding Countrywide Capital Markets, LLC as a defendant. The Countrywide defendants filed a demurrer to the amended complaint, but the court declined to rule on the demurrer and instead entered an order staying the case until August 2011. On August 18, 2011, the court ordered a partial lifting of the stay to permit certain limited discovery to proceed. The stay otherwise remains in effect.  
    
  Syncora 
  The Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in an action filed by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (Syncora) entitled   Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., et al.   This action, currently pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to bond insurance policies provided by Syncora on certain securitized pools of HELOC. In March 2010, the court issued an order that granted in part and denied in part the Countrywide defendants  motion to dismiss. Syncora and the Countrywide defendants filed cross-appeals from this order. In May 2010, Syncora amended its complaint. Defendants filed an answer to Syncora s amended complaint on July 9, 2010, as well as a counterclaim for breach of contract and declaratory judgment. The parties subsequently stipulated to the dismissal of defendants  counterclaim without prejudice. Following the appellate court s June 30, 2011 order on the cross-appeals in   MBIA Insurance Corporation, Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, et al.  , the parties entered a joint stipulated order withdrawing their cross-appeals. 
  On August 16, 2011, Syncora moved for partial summary judgment, seeking rulings that: (i) Syncora does not have to show that Countrywide s alleged fraud and breaches of contract proximately caused Syncora s losses; and (ii) the term  materially and adversely affects  in the transaction documents does not limit the repurchase remedy to defaulted loans, or require Syncora to show that Countrywide s breaches of the representations and warranties caused the loans to default. On January 3, 2012, the court issued a decision and order that granted in part and denied in part Syncora s motion. The court ruled that under New York insurance law, Syncora does not need to prove a causal link between Countrywide s alleged misrepresentations and the payments made pursuant to the policies. The Court also held plaintiff could recover  rescissory damages  (the amounts it has been required to pay pursuant to the polices less premiums received) on such claims, but must prove that it was damaged as a direct result of Countrywide s alleged material misrepresentations. The court denied the motion in its entirety on the issue of the interpretation of the  materially and adversely affects  language. On January 6, 2012, Syncora appealed the decision and order to the extent it denied Syncora s motion. On January 25, 2012, Countrywide filed a cross-appeal of the court s decision and order to the extent it granted Syncora s motion.

     Fair Lending Investigation 
  On December 21, 2011, CFC, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (CHL), and Countrywide Bank (which was merged into BANA effective July 1, 2011) entered into a consent order to resolve an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into legacy lending practices of Countrywide. The investigation concerned alleged discriminatory lending practices by Countrywide in the extension of residential credit and in residential real estate-related transactions. The investigation and resulting consent order did not relate to the current lending practices of the Corporation or of its affiliates. The consent order does not require any injunctive provisions against the Corporation or BANA concerning its lending practices. The consent order requires the establishment of a restitution fund of   $335 million   to be paid to allegedly aggrieved borrowers. This amount was fully accrued by the Corporation as of   December 31, 2011  . The consent order was entered by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on December 28, 2011. 
    
  Fontainebleau Las Vegas Litigation 
  On June 9, 2009, Fontainebleau Las Vegas, LLC (FBLV), then a Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession, commenced an adversary proceeding, entitled   Fontainebleau Las Vegas, LLC v. Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, et al  . (FBLV action), against a group of lenders, including BANA and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation (MLCC). The action was originally filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Florida, but is now before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On April 12, 2010, FBLV s Chapter 11 case was converted to a Chapter 7 case and a trustee was appointed (the Bankruptcy Trustee). The complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants breached an agreement to lend their respective committed amounts under an   $800 million   revolving loan facility, of which BANA and MLCC had each committed   $100 million  , in connection with the construction of a resort and casino development. The complaint seeks damages in excess of   $3 billion   and a  turnover  order under Section 542 of the Bankruptcy Code requiring the lenders to fund their respective commitments. On September 21, 2010, the court dismissed the breach of contract and turnover claims to allow the Bankruptcy Trustee, as plaintiff, to pursue an immediate appeal of the court s August 2009 decision denying partial summary judgment of certain of FBLV s claims. The Bankruptcy Trustee filed a notice of appeal on October 18, 2010 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
  On June 9, 2009, a related lawsuit,   Avenue CLO Fund Ltd., et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, et al  . (the Avenue action), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada by certain project lenders. On September 21, 2009, another related lawsuit,   ACP Master, Ltd., et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, et al  . (the ACP action), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by the purported successors-in-interest to certain project lenders. These two actions were subsequently transferred by the JPML to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for coordinated pretrial proceedings with the FBLV action. Plaintiffs in the Avenue and ACP actions (the Term Lenders) repeat FBLV s allegations that BANA, MLCC and the other defendants breached their revolving loan facility commitments to FBLV. In addition, they allege that BANA breached its duties as disbursement agent under a separate agreement governing the disbursement of loaned funds to FBLV. The Term Lenders seek unspecified money damages on their claims. On May 28, 2010,  

the district court granted defendants  motion to dismiss the revolving loan facility commitment claims, but denied BANA s motion to dismiss the disbursement agent claims. On January 13, 2011, the district court granted the Term Lenders  motion for entry of a partial final judgment on their revolving loan facility commitment claims. The Term Lenders filed a notice of appeal with respect to those claims on January 19, 2011. 
  On April 19, 2011, the district court dismissed the disbursement agent claims against BANA in the ACP action after the Avenue action plaintiffs represented that they had acquired the claims belonging to the ACP action plaintiffs and would be pursuing those claims in the Avenue action. On September 27, 2011, the Avenue action parties submitted their respective motions for summary judgment on the disbursement agent claims. 
  In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation 
  BAS, Merrill Lynch   Co., MLPF S, and certain of their subsidiaries, along with other underwriters, and various issuers and others, were named as defendants in a number of putative class action lawsuits that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York as   In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation.   Plaintiffs contend, among other things, that defendants failed to make certain required disclosures in the registration statements and prospectuses for applicable offerings regarding alleged agreements with institutional investors that tied allocations in certain offerings to the purchase orders by those investors in the aftermarket. Plaintiffs allege that such agreements allowed defendants to manipulate the price of the securities sold in these offerings in violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. The parties agreed to settle the matter, for which the court granted final approval. Certain putative class members filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking reversal of the final approval. On August 25, 2011, the district court, on remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, dismissed the objection by the last remaining putative class member, concluding that he was not a class member. On January 9, 2012, that objector dismissed with prejudice an appeal of the court s dismissal pursuant to a settlement agreement. On November 28, 2011, an objector whose appeals were dismissed by the Second Circuit filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court that was rejected as procedurally defective. On January 17, 2012, the Supreme Court advised the objector that the petition was untimely and should not be resubmitted to the Supreme Court. 
  Interchange and Related Litigation 
  A group of merchants have filed a series of putative class actions and individual actions with regard to interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. These actions, which have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption   In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Anti-Trust Litigation   (  Interchange  ), name Visa, MasterCard and several banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation, as defendants. Plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to fix the level of default interchange rates, which represent the fee an issuing bank charges an acquiring bank on every transaction. Plaintiffs also challenge as unreasonable restraints of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act certain rules of Visa and MasterCard related to merchant acceptance of payment cards at the point of sale.  

Table of Contents  

     Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief based on their assertion that interchange would be lower or eliminated absent the alleged conduct. On January 8, 2008, the court granted defendants  motion to dismiss all claims for pre-2004 damages. Motions to dismiss the remainder of the complaint and plaintiffs  motion for class certification are pending. In February 2011, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. 
  In addition, plaintiffs filed supplemental complaints against certain defendants, including the Corporation, relating to initial public offerings (the IPOs) of MasterCard and Visa. Plaintiffs allege that the IPOs violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs also assert that the MasterCard IPO was a fraudulent conveyance. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and to undo the IPOs. Motions to dismiss both supplemental complaints, as well as summary judgment motions challenging both supplemental complaints, remain pending. 
  The Corporation and certain affiliates have entered into loss-sharing agreements with Visa, Mastercard and other financial institutions in connection with certain antitrust litigation, including   Interchange  . Collectively, the loss-sharing agreements require the Corporation and/or certain affiliates to pay   11.6 percent   of the monetary portion of any comprehensive   Interchange   settlement. In the event of an adverse judgment, the agreements require the Corporation and/or certain affiliates to pay   12.8 percent   of any damages associated with Visa-related claims (Visa-related damages),   9.1 percent   of any damages associated with MasterCard-related claims, and   11.6 percent   of any damages associated with internetwork claims (internetwork damages) or not associated specifically with Visa or MasterCard-related claims (unassigned damages). 
  Pursuant to Visa s publicly-disclosed Retrospective Responsibility Plan (the RRP), Visa placed certain proceeds from its IPO into an escrow fund (the Escrow). Under the RRP, funds in the Escrow may be accessed by Visa and its members, including Bank of America, to pay monetary damages in   Interchange  , with the Corporation s payments from the Escrow capped at   12.81 percent   of the funds that Visa places therein. Subject to that cap, the Corporation may use Escrow funds to cover   73.9 percent   of its monetary payment towards a comprehensive   Interchange   settlement,   100 percent   of its payment for any Visa-related damages and   73.9 percent   of its payment for any internetwork and unassigned damages. 
  Two actions,   Watson v. Bank of America Corp.  , filed on March 28, 2011 in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, and   Bancroft-Snell v. Visa Canada Corp.  , filed on May 16, 2011 in Ontario Superior Court, were filed by purported nationwide classes of merchants that accept Visa and/or MasterCard credit cards in Canada. The actions name as defendants Visa, MasterCard, and a number of other banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation. Plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to fix the merchant discount fees that merchants pay to acquiring banks on credit card transactions. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants conspired to impose certain rules relating to merchant acceptance of credit cards at the point of sale. The actions assert claims under section 45 of the Competition Act and other common law claims, and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief based on their assertion that merchant discount fees would be lower absent the challenged conduct. These actions are not covered by the RRP or loss-sharing agreements previously entered into in connection with certain antitrust litigation, including   Interchange  .  

Merrill Lynch Acquisition-related Matters 
  Since January 2009, the Corporation and certain of its current and former officers and directors, among others, have been named as defendants in a variety of actions filed in state and federal courts relating to the Corporation s acquisition of Merrill Lynch (the Acquisition). These Acquisition-related cases consist of securities actions, derivative actions and actions under ERISA. The claims in these actions generally concern: (i) the Acquisition; (ii) the financial condition and 2008 fourth-quarter losses experienced by the Corporation and Merrill Lynch; (iii) due diligence conducted in connection with the Acquisition; (iv) the Acquisition agreements  terms regarding Merrill Lynch s ability to pay bonuses to Merrill Lynch employees up to   $5.8 billion  ; (v) the Corporation s discussions with government officials in December 2008 regarding the Corporation s consideration of invoking the material adverse change clause in the Acquisition agreement and the possibility of obtaining government assistance in completing the Acquisition; and/or (vi) alleged material misrepresentations and/or material omissions in the proxy statement and related materials for the Acquisition. 
  Securities Actions 
  Plaintiffs in   In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation   (Securities Plaintiffs), a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, represent all: (i) purchasers of the Corporation s common and preferred securities between September 15, 2008 and January 21, 2009 and its January 2011 options; (ii) holders of the Corporation s common stock as of October 10, 2008; and (iii) purchasers of the Corporation s common stock issued in the offering that occurred on or about October 7, 2008. During the purported class period, the Corporation had between   4,560,112,687   and   5,017,579,321   common shares outstanding and the price of those shares declined from   $33.74   on September 12, 2008 to   $6.68   on January 21, 2009. Securities Plaintiffs claim violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Securities Plaintiffs  amended complaint also alleges violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 related to the offering of the Corporation s common stock that occurred on or about October 7, 2008, and names BAS and MLPF S, among others, as defendants on certain claims. The Corporation and its co-defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the court granted in part in August 2010 by dismissing certain of the Securities Plaintiffs  claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Securities Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint which repleaded some of the dismissed claims as well as added claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of holders of certain debt, preferred securities and option securities. In July 2011, the court granted in part defendants  motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. As a result of the court s July 2011 ruling, the Securities Plaintiffs were (in addition to the claims sustained in the court s August 2010 ruling) permitted to pursue a claim under Section 10(b) asserting that defendants should have made additional disclosures in connection with the Acquisition about the financial condition and 2008 fourth-quarter losses experienced by Merrill Lynch. Securities Plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, legal costs and attorneys  fees. On February 6, 2012, the court granted Securities Plaintiffs   

Table of Contents  

     motion for class certification. On February 21, 2012, the Corporation filed a petition requesting that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit review the district court s order granting Securities Plaintiffs  motion for class certification. 
  Several individual plaintiffs have opted to pursue claims apart from the   In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative, and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation   and, accordingly, have initiated individual actions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York relying on substantially the same facts and claims as the Securities Plaintiffs.  
  On January 13, 2010, the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and certain of the Corporation s current and former officers and directors were named in a purported class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entitled   Dornfest v. Bank of America Corp., et al  . The action is purportedly brought on behalf of investors in Corporation option contracts between September 15, 2008 and January 22, 2009 and alleges that during the class period approximately   9.5 million   Corporation call option contracts and approximately   eight million   Corporation put option contracts were traded on seven of the Options Clearing Corporation exchanges. The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, legal costs and attorneys  fees. On April 9, 2010, the court consolidated this action with the consolidated securities action in the   In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation  , and ruled that plaintiffs may pursue the action as an individual action. In August 2011, plaintiff again asked the court for permission to pursue claims on a class basis, which the court again denied in an order issued in September 2011. Plaintiffs have attempted to appeal that ruling. 
  Derivative Actions 
  The Corporation and certain current and former directors are named as defendants in several putative class and derivative actions in the Delaware Court of Chancery, including:   Rothbaum v. Lewis  ;   Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v. Lewis; Tremont Partners LLC v. Lewis; Kovacs v. Lewis; Stern v. Lewis  ; and   Houx v. Lewis  , brought by shareholders alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and waste of corporate assets in connection with the Acquisition. On April 27, 2009, the Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated the derivative actions under the caption   In re Bank of America Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation  . The consolidated derivative complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On April 30, 2009, the putative class claims in the   Stern v. Lewis   and   Houx v. Lewis   actions were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Trial is scheduled for October 2012. 
  In addition, the JPML ordered the transfer of actions related to the Acquisition that had been pending in various federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. These actions have been separately consolidated and are now pending under the caption   In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation. 
  On October 9, 2009, plaintiffs in the derivative actions in the   In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation   (the Derivative Plaintiffs) filed a consolidated amended derivative and class action complaint. The amended complaint names as defendants certain of the Corporation s current and former directors, officers and  

financial advisors, and certain of Merrill Lynch s current and former directors and officers. The Corporation is named as a nominal defendant with respect to the derivative claims. The amended complaint asserts claims for, among other things: (i) violation of federal securities laws; (ii) breach of fiduciary duties; (iii) the return of incentive compensation that is alleged to be inappropriate in view of the work performed and the results achieved by certain of the defendants; and (iv) contribution in connection with the Corporation s exposure to significant liability under state and federal law. The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On February 8, 2010, the Derivative Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against each of the former Merrill Lynch officers and directors without prejudice. The Corporation and its co-defendants filed motions to dismiss, which were granted in part on August 27, 2010. On October 18, 2010, the Corporation and its co-defendants answered the remaining allegations asserted by the Derivative Plaintiffs. 
  ERISA Actions 
  On October 9, 2009, plaintiffs in the ERISA actions in the   In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation   (the ERISA Plaintiffs) filed a consolidated amended complaint for breaches of duty under ERISA. The amended complaint is brought on behalf of a purported class that consists of participants in the Corporation s 401(k) Plan, the Corporation s 401(k) Plan for Legacy Companies, the CFC 401(k) Plan (collectively, the 401(k) Plans) and the Corporation s Pension Plan. The amended complaint alleges violations of ERISA, based on, among other things: (i) an alleged failure to prudently and loyally manage the 401(k) Plans and Pension Plan by continuing to offer the Corporation s common stock as an investment option or measure for participant contributions; (ii) an alleged failure to monitor the fiduciaries of the 401(k) Plans and Pension Plan; (iii) an alleged failure to provide complete and accurate information to the 401(k) Plans and Pension Plan participants with respect to the Merrill Lynch and Countrywide acquisitions and related matters; and (iv) alleged co-fiduciary liability for these purported fiduciary breaches. The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On August 27, 2010, the court dismissed the complaint brought by plaintiffs in the consolidated ERISA action in its entirety. The ERISA Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the court s dismissal of their actions. The parties then stipulated to the dismissal of the appeal with the agreement that the ERISA Plaintiffs can reinstate their appeal at any time up until July 27, 2012. 
  NYAG Action 
  On February 4, 2010, the New York Attorney General (NYAG) filed a civil complaint in New York Supreme Court entitled   People of the State of New York v. Bank of America, et al  . The complaint names as defendants the Corporation and the Corporation s former CEO and CFO, and alleges violations of Sections 352, 352-c(1)(a), 352-c(1)(c) and 353 of the New York General Business Law, commonly known as the Martin Act, and Section 63(12) of the New York Executive Law. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount in disgorgement, penalties, restitution, and damages and other equitable relief.

     Montgomery 
  The Corporation, several current and former officers and directors, BAS, MLPF S and other unaffiliated underwriters have been named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entitled   Montgomery v. Bank of America, et al  . Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on January 14, 2011. Plaintiff seeks to sue on behalf of all persons who acquired certain series of preferred stock offered by the Corporation pursuant to a shelf registration statement dated May 5, 2006. Plaintiff s claims arise from three offerings dated January 24, 2008, January 28, 2008 and May 20, 2008, from which the Corporation allegedly received proceeds of   $15.8 billion  . The amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and alleges that the prospectus supplements associated with the offerings: (i) failed to disclose that the Corporation s loans, leases, CDOs and commercial MBS were impaired to a greater extent than disclosed; (ii) misrepresented the extent of the impaired assets by failing to establish adequate reserves or properly record losses for its impaired assets; (iii) misrepresented the adequacy of the Corporation s internal controls in light of the alleged impairment of its assets; (iv) misrepresented the Corporation s capital base and Tier 1 leverage ratio for risk-based capital in light of the allegedly impaired assets; and (v) misrepresented the thoroughness and adequacy of the Corporation s due diligence in connection with its acquisition of Countrywide. The amended complaint seeks rescission, compensatory and other damages. Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On February 9, 2012, the magistrate judge (to whom dispositive motions were referred for a report and recommendation) concluded that the amended complaint does not adequately plead claims under the Securities Act of 1933 and recommended that the district court dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety and deny plaintiffs  request to amend the complaint without prejudice, which the district court will consider. 
  Mortgage-backed Securities Litigation 
  The Corporation and its affiliates, Countrywide entities and their affiliates, and Merrill Lynch entities and their affiliates have been named as defendants in a number of cases relating to their various roles as issuer, originator, seller, depositor, sponsor, underwriter and/or controlling entity in MBS offerings, pursuant to which the MBS investors were entitled to a portion of the cash flow from the underlying pools of mortgages. These cases generally include purported class action suits and actions by individual MBS purchasers. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these cases generally allege that the registration statements, prospectuses and prospectus supplements for securities issued by securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and omissions, in violation of Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and/or state securities laws and other state statutory and common laws. 
  These cases generally involve allegations of false and misleading statements regarding: (i) the process by which the properties that served as collateral for the mortgage loans underlying the MBS were appraised; (ii) the percentage of equity that mortgage borrowers had in their homes; (iii) the borrowers  ability to repay their mortgage loans; (iv) the underwriting practices by which those mortgage loans were originated; (v) the ratings  

given to the different tranches of MBS by rating agencies; and (vi) the validity of each issuing trust s title to the mortgage loans comprising the pool for that securitization (collectively, MBS Claims). Plaintiffs in these cases generally seek unspecified compensatory damages, unspecified costs and legal fees and, in some instances, seek rescission. A number of other entities (including the National Credit Union Administration) have threatened legal actions against the Corporation and its affiliates, Countrywide entities and their affiliates, and Merrill Lynch entities and their affiliates concerning MBS offerings. 
  On August 15, 2011, the JPML ordered multiple federal court cases involving Countrywide MBS consolidated for pretrial purposes in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, in a multi-district litigation entitled   In re Countrywide Financial Corp. Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation   (the Countrywide RMBS MDL). 
  AIG Litigation 
  On August 8, 2011, American International Group, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, AIG) filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court, New York County, in a case entitled   American International Group, Inc. et al. v. Bank of America Corporation et al.   AIG has named the Corporation, Merrill Lynch, CHL and a number of related entities as defendants. AIG s complaint asserts certain MBS Claims pertaining to   347   MBS offerings and two private placements in which it alleges that it purchased securities between 2005 and 2007. AIG seeks rescission of its purchases or a rescissory measure of damages or, in the alternative, compensatory damages of no less than   $10 billion  ; punitive damages; and other unspecified relief. Defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and filed a notice with the JMDL seeking to add the case to the Countrywide RMBS MDL. The district court denied AIG s motion to remand the case to state court. Plaintiffs are seeking an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit following the district court s certification. On December 21, 2011, the JMDL transferred the Countrywide MBS claims to the Countrywide RMBS MDL. The non-Countrywide MBS claims will be heard in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  
  Dexia Litigation 
  Dexia Holdings, Inc. and others filed an action on January 24, 2011 against CFC, the Corporation, several related entities, and former directors and officers of Countrywide in New York Supreme Court, New York County entitled   Dexia Holdings, Inc., et al., v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al.   The complaint asserts certain MBS Claims relating to plaintiffs  alleged purchases of MBS issued by CFC-related entities in 142 MBS offerings and six private placements between April 2004 and August 2007 and seeks unspecified compensatory and/or rescissory damages, punitive damages and other unspecified relief. Defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and on August 15, 2011, the JMDL transferred the case to the Countrywide RMBS MDL. On November 8, 2011, the Countrywide RMBS MDL denied plaintiffs  motion to remand the case to New York Supreme Court. On February 17, 2012, the Countrywide RMBS MDL granted in substantial part defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice all federal law claims

  The FHFA, as conservator for FNMA and FHLMC, filed an action on September 2, 2011 against the Corporation and related entities, CFC and related entities, certain former officers of these entities, and NB Holdings Corporation in New York Supreme Court, New York County, entitled   Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al.   (the FHFA Countrywide Litigation). FHFA s complaint asserts certain MBS Claims in connection with allegations that FNMA and FHLMC purchased MBS issued by CFC-related entities in 86 MBS offerings between 2005 and 2008. The FHFA seeks among other relief, rescission of the consideration paid for the securities or alternatively damages allegedly incurred by FNMA and FHLMC.

  Luther Litigation and Related Actions 
  On November 14, 2007, David H. Luther and various pension funds (collectively, the Luther Plaintiffs) commenced a putative class action against CFC, several of its affiliates, MLPF S and certain former officers of these in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County, entitled   Luther v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al.   (the Luther Action). The Luther Plaintiffs  complaint asserts certain MBS Claims in connection with MBS issued by subsidiaries of CFC in 429 offerings between 2005 and 2007. The Luther Plaintiffs certified that they collectively purchased securities in 63 of 429 offerings for approximately   $216 million  . The Luther Plaintiffs seek compensatory and/or rescissory damages and other unspecified relief. On January 6, 2010, the court granted CFC s motion to dismiss with prejudice due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On May 18, 2011, the California Court of Appeal reversed the dismissal and remanded to the Superior Court. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.  
  Following the previous dismissal of the Luther Action on January 6, 2010, the Maine State Retirement System filed a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, entitled   Maine State Retirement System v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al.   (the Maine Action). The Maine Action names the same defendants as the Luther Action, as well as the Corporation and NB Holdings Corporation, and asserts substantially the same allegations regarding 427 of the MBS offerings that were at issue in the Luther Action. Plaintiffs in the Maine Action (Maine Plaintiffs) seek compensatory and/or rescissory damages and other unspecified relief. 
  On November 4, 2010, the court granted CFC s motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety and held that the Maine Plaintiffs only have standing to sue over the 81 offerings in which they actually purchased MBS. The court also held that the applicable statute of limitations could be tolled by the filing of the Luther Action only with respect to the offerings in which the Luther Plaintiffs actually purchased MBS. As a result of these standing and tolling rulings, the number of offerings at issue in the Maine Action was reduced from 427 to 14. On December 6, 2010, the Maine Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that relates to 14 MBS offerings. On April 21, 2011, the court dismissed with prejudice the successor liability claims against the Corporation and NB Holdings Corporation.     On May 6, 2011, the court held that the Maine Plaintiffs only have standing to sue over the specific MBS tranches that they purchased, and that the applicable statute of limitations could be tolled by the filing of the Luther Action only  

Table of Contents  

     with respect to the specific tranches of MBS that the Luther Plaintiffs purchased. As a result of these tranche-specific standing and tolling rulings, the Maine Action was further reduced from 14 offerings to eight tranches. On June 6, 2011, the Maine Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that related to eight MBS tranches. On June 15, 2011, the court denied the Maine Plaintiffs  motion to permit immediate interlocutory appeal of the court s orders on standing, tolling of the statute of limitations and successor liability. On October 12, 2011, upon stipulation by the parties, the court certified a class consisting of eight subclasses, one for each of the eight MBS tranches at issue.  
  On November 17, 2010, Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund (Western Teamsters) filed a putative class action against the same defendants named in the Maine Action in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County, entitled   Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al  . Western Teamsters  complaint asserts that Western Teamsters and other unspecified investors purchased MBS issued in the 428 offerings that were also at issue in the Luther Action and asserts substantially the same allegations as the Luther Action. The Western Teamsters action has been coordinated with the Luther Action. Western Teamsters seek unspecified compensatory and/or rescissory damages and other unspecified relief. 
  On January 27, 2011, Putnam Bank filed a putative class action lawsuit against CFC, the Corporation and several related entities, among others, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, entitled   Putnam Bank v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al  . Putnam Bank s complaint asserts certain MBS Claims in connection with alleged purchases in eight MBS offerings issued by CFC subsidiaries between 2005 and 2007.

On August 15, 2011, the case was transferred to the Countrywide RMBS MDL. 
  Sealink Litigation 
  On September 29, 2011, Sealink Funding Limited filed a complaint against the Corporation and related entities, Countrywide entities, NB Holdings Corporation and certain former officers of Countrywide.

System of Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch   Co. Inc  . Plaintiffs assert certain MBS Claims in connection with their purchase of MBS. In March 2010, the court dismissed claims related to 65 of 84 offerings with prejudice due  

to lack of standing as no named plaintiff purchased securities in those offerings. On November 8, 2010, the court dismissed claims related to one additional offering on separate grounds. On December 14, 2011, the court granted preliminary approval of a settlement providing for a payment by the Corporation in an amount not material to the Corporation s results of operations (which amount was fully accrued by the Corporation as of December 31, 2011).

ABP seeks unspecified compensatory damages, interest and legal fees, or alternatively, rescission.   
  Regulatory Investigations 
  The Corporation has received a number of subpoenas and other requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities regarding MBS and other mortgage-related matters, including inquiries and investigations related to a number of transactions involving the Corporation s underwriting and issuance of MBS and its participation in certain CDO offerings. These inquiries and investigations include, among others, an investigation by the SEC related to Merrill Lynch s risk control, valuation, structuring, marketing and purchase of CDOs. The Corporation has provided documents and testimony and continues to cooperate fully with these inquiries and investigations. 
  Countrywide may also be subject to contractual indemnification for the benefit of certain individuals involved in the MBS matters discussed above. 
  Mortgage Repurchase Litigation 
  Walnut Place Litigation 
  On February 23, 2011, 11 entities with the common name Walnut Place (including Walnut Place LLC, and Walnut Place II LLC through Walnut Place XI LLC) filed a lawsuit, entitled   Walnut Place LLC, et al. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. et al.,   in New York Supreme Court, New York County, against CHL and several unaffiliated defendants (collectively, Sellers), as well as the Corporation and the Bank of New York Mellon in its capacity as trustee. The initial complaint was a purported derivative action for alleged breaches of a pooling and servicing agreement under which the Sellers sold residential mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Plaintiffs are alleged holders of certificates in several classes of the securitization trust who purport to sue derivatively in the place of the trustee. Plaintiffs allege that Sellers breached representations and warranties in the pooling and servicing agreement regarding mortgage loans. Plaintiffs seek a court order requiring Sellers to repurchase the mortgage loans at issue, or alternatively, damages for breach of contract, and allege that the Corporation is a successor in liability to CHL. On April 12, 2011, plaintiffs amended  

Table of Contents  

     their complaint to add similar allegations with respect to an additional securitization trust. On May 17, 2011, the Corporation and Sellers jointly moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  
  On August 2, 2011, plaintiffs filed a separate action entitled   Walnut Place LLC, et al. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. et al  ., in New York Supreme Court, New York County, against the Corporation and Sellers, and The Bank of New York Mellon in its capacity as trustee. This action makes allegations similar to those in the prior   Walnut Place LLC, et al. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. et al  . lawsuit with respect to an additional securitization trust. On October 7, 2011, the Corporation and Sellers jointly moved to dismiss the complaint.  
  TMST, Inc. Litigation 
  On April 29, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for TMST, Inc. (formerly known as Thornburg Mortgage, Inc.) and for certain affiliated entities (collectively, Thornburg), along with Zuni Investors, LLC (ZI), filed an adversary proceeding in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland entitled   In Re TMST, Inc., f/k/a Thornburg Mortgage, Inc.   against CHL and the Corporation. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 29, 2011, in which they allege, among other things, that CHL sold residential mortgage loans to Thornburg pursuant to two agreements, and that CHL allegedly breached certain representations and warranties contained in those agreements concerning property appraisals, prudent and customary loan origination practices, accuracy of mortgage loan schedules, and occupancy status. The complaint further alleges that those loans were deposited by Thornburg into a securitization trust, that ZI purchased certificates issued by that trust, and that the securitization trustee subsequently assigned to ZI and the bankruptcy trustee the right to pursue representation and warranty claims. Plaintiffs seek a court order requiring CHL to repurchase the mortgage loans at issue, or alternatively, unspecified damages for alleged breach of contract. CHL and the Corporation have filed motions to dismiss the case, to withdraw the reference to the Bankruptcy Court, and for transfer of venue to the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  
  U.S. Bank Litigation 
  On August 29, 2011, U.S. Bank, National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee for the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10 (the Trust), a mortgage pool backed by loans originated by CHL, filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court, New York County, in a case entitled   U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust, Series 2005-10 v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (dba Bank of America Home Loans), Bank of America Corporation, Countrywide Financial Corporation, Bank of America, N.A., and NB Holdings Corporation.   U.S. Bank seeks a declaration that, as a result of alleged misrepresentations by CHL in connection with its sale of the loans, defendants must repurchase the loans. U.S. Bank further asserts that defendants are liable for breach of contract for the alleged failure to repurchase a subset of those loans. Defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. U.S. Bank filed a motion to remand which is currently pending. On February 7, 2012, the JPML issued an order transferring the case to the Countrywide RMBS MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. 

Mortgage Servicing Investigations and Litigation 
  The Corporation entered into a consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on April 13, 2011, which requires servicers to make several enhancements to their servicing operations, including implementation of a single point of contact model for borrowers throughout the loss mitigation and foreclosure processes, adoption of measures designed to ensure that foreclosure activity is halted once a borrower has been approved for a modification unless the borrower fails to make payments under the modified loan and implementation of enhanced controls over third-party vendors that provide default servicing support services. In addition, the consent order required that servicers retain an independent consultant, approved by the OCC, to conduct a review of all foreclosure actions pending, or foreclosure sales that occurred between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010 and submit a plan to the OCC to remediate all financial injury to borrowers caused by any deficiencies identified through the review. The review is comprised of two parts: a sample file review conducted by the independent consultant, which began in October 2011, and file reviews by the independent consultant based upon requests for review from customers with in-scope foreclosures. The Corporation began outreach to those customers in November 2011 and additional outreach efforts are underway. Because the review process is available to a large number of potentially eligible borrowers and involves an examination of many details and documents, each review could take several months to complete. The Corporation cannot yet accurately determine how many borrowers will request a review, how many borrowers will meet the eligibility requirements or how much in compensation might ultimately be paid to eligible borrower. 
  On February 9, 2012, the Corporation reached agreements in principle (collectively, the Servicing Resolution Agreements) with (i) the DOJ, various federal regulatory agencies and 49 attorneys general to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination, servicing and foreclosure practices (the Global AIP), (ii) the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA) to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily by Countrywide prior to and for a period following the acquisition of that lender (the FHA AIP) and (iii) each of the Federal Reserve and the OCC regarding civil monetary penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011 (the Consent Order AIPs). 
  The Servicing Resolution Agreements are subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and completion and execution of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. The Global AIP is subject to, among other things, Federal court approval in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia and regulatory approvals of the United States Department of the Treasury and other federal agencies. The Consent Order AIPs are subject to, among other things, the finalization of the Global AIP.  
  The Global AIP calls for the establishment of certain uniform servicing standards, upfront cash payments of approximately   $1.9 billion   to the state and federal governments and for borrower restitution, approximately   $7.6 billion   in borrower assistance in the form of, among other things, principal reduction, short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and approximately   $1.0 billion   of refinancing assistance. The Corporation could be required to make additional payments if it fails to meet its borrower assistance and  

Table of Contents  

     refinancing assistance commitments over a three-year period. In addition, the Corporation could be required to pay an additional   $350 million   if the Corporation fails to meet certain first-lien principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period. The Corporation also entered into agreements with several states under which it committed to perform certain minimum levels of principal reduction and related activities within those states as part of the Global AIP, and under which it could be required to make additional payments if it fails to meet such minimum levels. The Corporation may also incur additional operating costs (e.g., servicing costs) to implement certain terms of the Global AIP in future periods. The FHA AIP provides for an upfront cash payment by the Corporation of   $500 million  . The FHA would release the Corporation from all claims arising from loans originated prior to April 30, 2009 that were submitted for FHA insurance claim payments prior to January 1, 2012, and from multiple damages and penalties for loans that were originated on or before April 30, 2009, but had not been submitted for FHA insurance claim payment. The Corporation would have the obligation to pay an additional   $500 million   if the Corporation fails to meet certain principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period.  
  Pursuant to an agreement in principle, the OCC agreed to hold in abeyance the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of   $164 million  . Pursuant to a separate agreement in principle, the Federal Reserve will assess a civil monetary penalty in the amount of   $176 million   against the Corporation. Satisfying its payment, borrower assistance and remediation obligations under the Global AIP will satisfy any civil monetary penalty obligations arising under these agreements in principle. If, however, the Corporation does not make certain required payments or undertake certain required actions under the Global AIP, the OCC will assess, and the Federal Reserve will require the Corporation to pay the difference between the aggregate value of the payments and actions under these agreements in principle and the penalty amounts.  
  Under the terms of the Global AIP, the federal and participating state governments would release the Corporation from further liability for certain alleged residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure deficiencies. In settling origination issues related to FHA guaranteed loans originated on or before April 30  ,   2009, the FHA would provide the Corporation and its affiliates a release for all claims with respect to such loans if an insurance claim had been submitted to the FHA prior to January 1, 2012 and a release of multiple damages and penalties (but not single damages) if no such claim had been submitted. 
  The Servicing Resolution Agreements do not cover claims arising out of securitization, including representations made to investors respecting MBS, criminal claims, private claims by borrowers, claims by certain states for injunctive relief or actual economic damages to borrowers related to the Mortgage Electronic Registration System, and claims by the GSEs (including repurchase demands), among other items.  
  The Corporation continues to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to its past and current servicing and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the Servicing Resolution Agreements. This scrutiny may extend beyond the Corporation s pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny may subject the Corporation to inquiries or investigations. 

Ocala Litigation 
  BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation and Deutsche Bank AG each filed claims (the 2009 Actions) against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entitled   BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation v. Bank of America, N.A.   and   Deutsche Bank AG v. Bank of America, N.A  . Plaintiffs allege that BANA failed to properly perform its duties as indenture trustee, collateral agent, custodian and depositary for Ocala Funding, LLC (Ocala), a home mortgage warehousing facility, resulting in the loss of plaintiffs  investment in Ocala. Ocala was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Taylor, Bean   Whitaker Mortgage Corp. (TBW), a home mortgage originator and servicer which is alleged to have committed fraud that led to its eventual bankruptcy. Ocala provided funding for TBW s mortgage origination activities by issuing notes, the proceeds of which were to be used by TBW to originate home mortgages. Such mortgages and other Ocala assets in turn were pledged to BANA, as collateral agent, to secure the notes. Plaintiffs lost most or all of their investment in Ocala when, as the result of the alleged fraud committed by TBW, Ocala was unable to repay the notes purchased by plaintiffs and there was insufficient collateral to satisfy Ocala s debt obligations. Plaintiffs allege that BANA breached its contractual, fiduciary and other duties to Ocala, thereby permitting TBW s alleged fraud to go undetected. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other relief from BANA, including interest and attorneys  fees, in an unspecified amount, but which plaintiffs allege exceeds   $1.6 billion  .  
  On March 23, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order granting in part and denying in part BANA s motions to dismiss the 2009 Actions. The court dismissed plaintiffs  claims against BANA in its capacity as custodian and depositary, as well as plaintiffs  claims for contractual indemnification and other claims. The court retained the claims questioning BANA s performance as indenture trustee and collateral agent. Finally, the court agreed with BANA that plaintiffs may not pursue claims for any breach that arose prior to July 20, 2009 (the date on which plaintiffs purchased the last issuance of Ocala notes). On December 29, 2011, plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaints to include additional contractual, tort and equitable claims. 
  On June 22, 2011, BANA filed third-party complaints in the 2009 Actions against BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (BNP Securities) and Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (Deutsche Securities) seeking contribution for damages sustained by BANA in the underlying actions. BNP Securities and Deutsche Securities (collectively, the Note Dealers) served as note dealers and private placement agents for the Ocala notes that are the subject of the underlying actions. On September 15, 2011, the Note Dealers moved to dismiss the third-party complaints.  
  On August 30, 2010, plaintiffs each filed new lawsuits (the 2010 Actions) against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entitled   BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation v. Bank of America, N.A.   and   Deutsche Bank AG v. Bank of America, N.A.  , which the parties agreed to transfer to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York as related to the 2009 Actions. On December 29, 2011, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the 2010 Actions without prejudice and moved for leave to amend their complaints in the 2009 Actions, as discussed above. 
  On October 1, 2010, BANA, on behalf of Ocala s investors, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDIC as receiver of Colonial Bank, TBW s primary bank, and Platinum Community Bank (Platinum, a wholly-owned subsidiary  

Table of Contents  

     of TBW) entitled   Bank of America, National Association as indenture trustee, custodian and collateral agent for Ocala Funding, LLC v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  . The suit seeks judicial review of the FDIC s denial of the administrative claims brought by BANA in the FDIC s Colonial and Platinum receivership proceedings. BANA s claims allege that Ocala s losses were in whole or in part the result of Colonial and Platinum s participation in TBW s alleged fraud. BANA seeks a court order requiring the FDIC to allow BANA s claims in an amount equal to Ocala s losses and, accordingly, to permit BANA, as trustee, collateral agent, custodian and depositary for Ocala, to share appropriately in distributions of any receivership assets that the FDIC makes to creditors of the two failed banks. 
  On March 14, 2011, the FDIC moved to dismiss BANA s action, primarily on the ground that Ocala Funding had not exhausted its administrative remedies. BANA filed an amended complaint alleging that it had exhausted its administrative remedies. On August 5, 2011, the FDIC answered and moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and asserted counterclaims against BANA in its individual capacity seeking approximately   $900 million   in damages. The counterclaims allege that Colonial sent   4,808   loans to BANA as bailee; that BANA converted the loans into Ocala collateral without first ensuring that Colonial was paid; and that Colonial was never paid for these loans. BANA filed an opposition to the FDIC s motion to dismiss on October 21, 2011, along with a motion to dismiss the FDIC s counterclaims. 
    NOTE 15   Shareholders  Equity 
  Common Stock 
  In November 2011, August 2011, May 2011 and January 2011, the Corporation s Board of Directors (the Board) declared the fourth, third, second and first quarter cash dividends of   $0.01   per common share, which were paid on   December 23, 2011  ,   September 23, 2011  ,   June 24, 2011   and   March 25, 2011   to common shareholders of record on   December 2, 2011  ,   September 2, 2011  ,   June 3, 2011   and   March 4, 2011  , respectively. In addition, in January 2012, the Board declared a first quarter cash dividend of   $0.01   per common share payable on   March 23, 2012   to common shareholders of record on   March 2, 2012  . 
  In connection with the exchanges described below in Preferred Stock, the Corporation issued   400 million   shares of common stock.  
  On September 1, 2011, the Corporation closed the sale to Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire) of   50,000   shares of the Series T Preferred Stock and a warrant (the Warrant) to purchase   700 million   shares of the Corporation s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $5.0 billion   in cash. Of the   $5.0 billion   in cash proceeds,   $2.9 billion   was allocated to preferred stock and   $2.1 billion   to the Warrant on a relative fair value basis. The discount on the Series T Preferred Stock is not subject to accretion. The portion of proceeds allocated to the Warrant was recorded as additional paid-in capital. The Warrant is exercisable at the holder s option at any time, in whole or in part until September 1, 2021, at an exercise price of   $7.142857   per share of common stock. The Warrant may be settled in cash or by exchanging all or a portion of the Series T Preferred Stock. For additional information on the Berkshire investment and Series T Preferred Stock, see Preferred Stock in this Note.  

On February 23, 2010, the Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders at which it obtained shareholder approval of an amendment to the Corporation s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from   10.0 billion   to   11.3 billion  . On April 28, 2010, at the Corporation s 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, the Corporation obtained shareholder approval of an amendment to the Corporation s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from   11.3 billion   to   12.8 billion  . 
  In January 2009, the Corporation issued   1.4 billion   shares of common stock in connection with its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. During   2009   and   2008  , in connection with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. government under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Corporation issued warrants to purchase   121.8 million   shares of common stock at an exercise price of   $30.79   per share and   150.4 million   shares of common stock at an exercise price of   $13.30   per share. The U.S. Treasury auctioned these warrants in March 2010. 
  In May 2009, the Corporation issued   1.3 billion   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $10.77   per share through an at-the-market issuance program resulting in gross proceeds of approximately   $13.5 billion  . 
  In connection with employee stock plans in   2011  , the Corporation issued approximately   51 million   shares and repurchased approximately   28 million   shares of its common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation had reserved   2.2 billion   unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, common stock warrants, convertible notes and preferred stock.  
  There is no existing Board authorized share repurchase program.  
  Preferred Stock 
  During both   2011   and   2010  , the dividends declared on preferred stock were   $1.4 billion  , and   $4.5 billion   for   2009  . 
  In   2011  , the Corporation entered into separate agreements with certain institutional preferred and Trust Security holders (the Exchange Agreements) pursuant to which the Corporation and each security holder agreed to exchange shares, or depository shares representing fractional interests in shares, of various series of the Corporation s preferred stock, par value   $0.01   per share, or Trust Securities for an aggregate of   400 million   shares of the Corporation s common stock valued at   $2.2 billion   and   $2.3 billion   aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The exchanges, in the aggregate, increased Tier 1 common capital by   $3.9 billion  , or approximately   29 bps  . The Exchange Agreements related to Trust Securities are described in   Note 13   Long-term Debt   and the Exchange Agreements related to preferred stock are described below. 
  As part of the Exchange Agreements, the Corporation exchanged non-convertible preferred stock, with an aggregate liquidation preference of   $815 million   and carrying value of   $814 million  , for   72 million   shares of common stock valued at   $399 million   and senior notes valued at   $231 million  . The   $184 million   difference between the carrying value of the non-convertible preferred stock and the fair value of the consideration issued to the holders of the non-convertible preferred stock was recorded in retained earnings as a non-cash reduction to preferred stock dividends. 

Table of Contents  

     Additionally, as a part of the Exchange Agreements, a portion of the Series L   7.25%   Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (Series L Preferred Stock) with an aggregate liquidation preference and carrying value of   $269 million   was exchanged for   20 million   common shares valued at   $123 million   and senior notes valued at   $129 million  . The   $17 million   difference between the carrying value of the Series L Preferred Stock and the fair value of the consideration issued to holders of the Series L Preferred Stock was reclassified from preferred stock to common stock and additional paid-in capital. Because the number of common shares issued to the Series L Preferred Stock holders was in excess of the number of common shares issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms, the   $220 million   fair value of consideration transferred to the Series L Preferred Stock holders in excess of the   $32 million   fair value of securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms was recorded as a non-cash preferred stock dividend. The dividend did not impact total shareholders  equity as it reduced retained earnings and increased common stock and additional paid-in capital by the same amount.  
  The table below lists the aggregate liquidation value of each series of preferred stock exchanged. 

(1)   
    Amounts shown are before third-party issuance costs. 
               (2)    
    Carrying value of preferred stock exchanged was   $1,083 million  . 
       
  The Series T Preferred Stock issued as part of the Berkshire investment has a liquidation value of   $100,000   per share and dividends on the Series T Preferred Stock accrue on the liquidation value at a rate per annum of   six percent   but will be paid only when and if declared by the Board out of legally available funds. Subject to the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Series T Preferred Stock may be redeemed by the Corporation at any time at a redemption price of   $105,000   per share plus any accrued, unpaid dividends. The Series T Preferred Stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to the outstanding common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions in liquidation. At any time when dividends on the Series T Preferred Stock have not been paid in full, the unpaid amounts will accrue dividends at a rate per annum of   eight percent   and the Corporation will not be permitted to pay dividends or other distributions on, or to repurchase, any outstanding common stock or any of the Corporation s outstanding preferred stock of any series. Following payment in full of accrued but unpaid dividends  

on the Series T Preferred Stock, the dividend rate remains at   eight percent   per annum.  
  In connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition, Merrill Lynch non-convertible preferred shareholders received Bank of America Corporation preferred stock having substantially identical terms. On October 15, 2010, all of the outstanding shares of the mandatory convertible preferred stock of Merrill Lynch automatically converted into an aggregate of   50 million   shares of the Corporation s common stock in accordance with the terms of these preferred securities. 
  In January 2009, in connection with TARP and the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation issued to the U.S. Treasury non-voting perpetual preferred stock for   $30.0 billion  . 
  In December 2009, the Corporation repurchased the non-voting perpetual preferred stock previously issued to the U.S. Treasury (TARP Preferred Stock) in 2009 and 2008 through the use of   $25.7 billion   in excess liquidity and   $19.3 billion   in proceeds from the sale of   1.3 billion   Common Equivalent Securities (CES) valued at   $15.00   per unit. The CES consisted of depositary shares representing interests in shares of Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) and contingent warrants to purchase an aggregate of   60 million   shares of the Corporation s common stock. On February 23, 2010, the Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders at which it obtained shareholder approval of an amendment to the Corporation s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. Accordingly, the Common Equivalent Stock automatically converted in full into   1.286 billion   shares of common stock on February 24, 2010. In addition, as a result, the contingent warrants expired without having become exercisable and the CES ceased to exist. 
  During   2009  , the Corporation entered into agreements with certain holders of non-government perpetual preferred stock to exchange their holdings of approximately   $7.3 billion   aggregate liquidation preference, before third-party issuance costs, of   323 million   shares of perpetual preferred stock for   545 million   shares of common stock with a fair value of   $6.1 billion  . In addition, the Corporation exchanged   $3.9 billion   aggregate liquidation preference, before third-party issuance costs, of   144 million   shares of non-government preferred stock for   200 million   shares of common stock in an exchange offer with a fair value of stock issued of   $2.5 billion  . In total, these exchanges resulted in the exchange of   $11.3 billion   aggregate liquidation preference, before third-party issuance costs, or   467 million   shares of preferred stock into   745 million   shares of common stock with a fair value of   $8.6 billion  . 
  In addition, during   2009  , the Corporation exchanged   3.6 million   shares, or   $3.6 billion   aggregate liquidation preference of Series L Preferred Stock into   255 million   shares of common stock with a fair value of   $2.8 billion  , which was accounted for as an induced conversion of preferred stock. 
  As a result of these 2009 exchanges, the Corporation recorded an increase to retained earnings and net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders of   $576 million  . This represents the net of a   $2.62 billion   benefit due to the excess of the carrying value of the Corporation s non-convertible preferred stock over the fair value of the common stock exchanged, partially offset by a   $2.04 billion   inducement representing the excess of the fair value of the common stock exchanged over the fair value of the common stock that would have been issued under the original conversion terms.

     Series L Preferred Stock listed in the Preferred Stock Summary table does not have early redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into   20   shares of the Corporation s common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. On or after January 30, 2013, the Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for   20   trading days during any period of   30   consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds   130 percent   of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If the Corporation exercises its rights to cause the automatic conversion of Series L Preferred Stock on January 30, 2013, it will still pay any accrued dividends payable on January 30, 2013 to the applicable holders of record. 
  All series of preferred stock in the Preferred Stock Summary table have a par value of   $0.01   per share, are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund, have no participation rights, and with the exception of the Series L Preferred Stock, are not convertible.  

The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series 1 through 8 Preferred Stock have general voting rights, and the holders of the other series included in the table have no general voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporation s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation s assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. With the exception of the Series T Preferred Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for   three   or more semi-annual or   six   or more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether consecutive or not), the holders of these series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a single class), will be entitled to vote for the election of   two   additional directors. These voting rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full dividends on these series for at least   two   semi-annual or   four   quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage.

   NOTE 17   Earnings Per Common Share 
  The calculation of EPS and diluted EPS for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009   is presented below. See   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles   for additional information on the calculation of EPS. 

(1)   
    Includes incremental shares from RSUs, restricted stock shares, stock options and warrants. 
       
    Due to the net loss applicable to common shareholders for   2010   and   2009  , no dilutive potential common shares were included in the calculation of diluted EPS because they would have been antidilutive. 
  For   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , average options to purchase   217 million  ,   271 million   and   315 million   shares, respectively, of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because they were antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For both   2011   and   2010  , average warrants to purchase   272 million   shares of common stock and   265 million   for 2009, were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because they were antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For   2011  ,   66 million   average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series L Preferred Stock were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the  if-converted  method. For   2010   and   2009  ,   107 million   and   147 million   average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series L Preferred Stock, and the mandatory convertible Preferred Stock Series 2 and Series 3 of Merrill Lynch were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the  if-converted  method. For   2009  ,   81 million   average dilutive potential common shares associated with the CES were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the  if-converted  method. For   2011  ,   234 million   average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series T Preferred Stock issued in 2011 were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the  if-converted  method.  
  For purposes of computing basic EPS, CES were considered to be participating securities prior to February 24, 2010, however, due to a net loss for   2010  , earnings were not allocated to the CES. The two-class method prohibits allocation of an undistributed loss to participating securities. For purposes of computing diluted EPS, there was no dilutive effect of the CES, which were outstanding prior to February 24, 2010, due to a net loss for   2010  . 

In   2011  , in connection with the exchanges described in   Note 15   Shareholders  Equity  , the Corporation recorded a net   $36 million   non-cash preferred stock dividend which is included in the calculation of net income allocated to common shareholders. 
  For   2009  , as a result of repurchasing the TARP Preferred Stock, the Corporation accelerated the remaining accretion of the issuance discount on the TARP Preferred Stock of   $4.0 billion   and recorded a corresponding charge to retained earnings and income (loss) applicable to common shareholders in the calculation of diluted EPS. In addition, in   2009  , the Corporation recorded an increase to retained earnings and net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders of   $576 million   related to the Corporation s preferred stock exchange for common stock. 
    NOTE 18   Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions 
  The Federal Reserve requires the Corporation s banking subsidiaries to maintain reserve balances based on a percentage of certain deposits. Average daily reserve balances required by the Federal Reserve were   $14.6 billion   and   $12.9 billion   for   2011   and   2010  . Currency and coin residing in branches and cash vaults (vault cash) are used to partially satisfy the reserve requirement. The average daily reserve balances, in excess of vault cash, held with the Federal Reserve amounted to   $6.5 billion   and   $5.5 billion   for   2011   and   2010  . 
  The primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the Corporation to its shareholders are dividends received from its banking subsidiaries, Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. In   2011  , the Corporation received   $9.8 billion   in dividends from Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A., returned capital of   $7.0 billion   to the Corporation. In 2012, Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. can declare and pay dividends to the Corporation of   $4.5 billion   and   $0   plus an additional amount equal to their net profits for   2012  , as defined by statute, up to the date of any such dividend declaration. The other subsidiary national banks can pay dividends in aggregate of   $1.0 billion   in   2012   plus an additional amount equal to their net profits for   2012  , as defined by statute, up to the date of any such dividend  

Table of Contents  

     declaration. The amount of dividends that each subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without approval by the OCC is the subsidiary bank s net profits for that year combined with its net retained profits, as defined, for the preceding two years. 
  The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC (collectively, joint agencies) have in place regulatory capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Failure to meet the capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Corporation s financial position. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to the credit and market risks of both on- and off-balance sheet items using various risk weights. Under the regulatory capital guidelines, Total capital consists of three tiers of capital. Tier 1 capital includes qualifying common shareholders  equity, qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, qualifying Trust Securities, hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interests, less goodwill and other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, a portion of net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities and other adjustments. Tier 3 capital includes subordinated debt that is unsecured, fully paid, has an original maturity of at least two years, is not redeemable before maturity without prior approval by the Federal Reserve and includes a lock-in clause precluding payment of either interest or principal if the payment would cause the issuing bank s risk-based capital ratio to fall or remain below the required minimum. Tier 3 capital can only be used to satisfy the Corporation s market risk capital requirement and may not be used to support its credit risk requirement. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation had   no   subordinated debt that qualified as Tier 3 capital. 
  Certain corporate-sponsored trust companies which issue Trust Securities are not consolidated. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance, Trust Securities continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits effective March 31, 2011. As a result, the Corporation includes Trust Securities in Tier 1 capital. The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which the Corporation s previously issued and outstanding Trust Securities in the aggregate amount of   $16.1 billion   (approximately   125   bps of Tier 1 capital) at   December 31, 2011  , will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital effective January 1, 2013. This amount excludes   $633 million   of hybrid Trust Securities that are expected to be converted to preferred stock prior to the date of implementation. The exclusion of Trust Securities from Tier 1 capital will be phased in incrementally over a three-year phase-in period. The treatment of Trust Securities during the phase-in period remains unclear and is subject to future rulemaking. 
  Current limits restrict core capital elements to   15   percent of  

total core capital elements for internationally active bank holding companies. Internationally active bank holding companies are those that have significant activities in non-U.S. markets with consolidated assets greater than   $250 billion   or on-balance sheet non-U.S. exposure greater than   $10 billion  . In addition, the Federal Reserve revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital. At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation s restricted core capital elements comprised   9.1 percent   of total core capital elements. The Corporation is and expects to remain compliant with the revised limits. 
  To meet minimum, adequately capitalized regulatory requirements, an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of   four percent   and a Total capital ratio of   eight percent  . A  well-capitalized  institution must generally maintain capital ratios   200   bps higher than the minimum guidelines. The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments.  Well-capitalized  bank holding companies must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of   four percent  . National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least   five percent   to be classified as  well-capitalized.  At   December 31, 2011  , the Corporation s Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios were   12.40 percent  ,   16.75 percent   and   7.53 percent  , respectively. This classifies the Corporation as  well-capitalized  for regulatory purposes, the highest classification. 
  Net unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities and marketable equity securities, net unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, and employee benefit plan adjustments in shareholders  equity are excluded from the calculations of Tier 1 common capital as discussed below, Tier 1 capital and leverage ratios. The Total capital ratio excludes all of the above with the exception of up to   45 percent   of the pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities. 
  The Corporation calculates Tier 1 common capital as Tier 1 capital including any CES less preferred stock, qualifying Trust Securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. CES was included in Tier 1 common capital based upon applicable regulatory guidance and the expectation at December 31, 2009 that the underlying Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S would convert into common stock following shareholder approval of additional authorized shares. Shareholders approved the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock and the Common Equivalent Stock converted into common stock on February 24, 2010. Tier 1 common capital was   $126.7 billion   and   $125.1 billion   and the Tier 1 common capital ratio was   9.86 percent   and   8.60 percent   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  .

    Regulatory Capital Developments 
  The Corporation manages regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy based on current understanding of the rules and the application of such rules to the Corporation s business as currently conducted. The regulatory capital rules as written by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) continue to evolve. 
  U.S. banking regulators published a final Basel II rule (Basel II) in December 2007, which requires the Corporation to implement Basel II at the holding company level as well as at certain U.S. bank subsidiaries, establishes requirements for the U.S. implementation and provides detailed requirements for a new regulatory capital framework related to credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). The Corporation is currently in the Basel II parallel period. 
  On December 15, 2010, U.S. regulators announced a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on the Risk-based Capital Guidelines for Market Risk. On December 29, 2011, U.S. regulators issued an NPR that would amend the December 2010 NPR. This amended NPR is expected to increase the capital requirements for the Corporation s trading assets and liabilities. The Corporation continues to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules and currently anticipates it will be in compliance with any final rules by the projected implementation date in late 2012.  
   In addition, the Basel Committee issued capital standards entitled  Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems,  together with liquidity standards discussed below (Basel III) in December 2010. The Corporation expects to be in compliance with the Basel III capital standards within the regulatory timelines. If implemented by U.S. banking regulators as proposed, Basel III could significantly increase the Corporation s capital requirements. Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of Trust Securities from Tier 1 capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing that the  

disqualification be phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets, MSRs, investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others, within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of accumulated OCI in capital, increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements. For additional information on deferred tax assets and MSRs, see   Note 21   Income Taxes   and   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights  .   The phase-in period for the capital deductions is proposed to occur in   20 percent   increments from 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by December 31, 2018. An increase in capital requirements for counterparty credit is proposed to be effective January 2013. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur between 2013 and 2019. U.S. banking regulators have indicated a goal to adopt final rules in 2012.  
  Preparing for the implementation of the new capital rules is a top strategic priority for the Corporation. The Corporation intends to continue to build capital through retaining earnings, actively reducing legacy asset portfolios and implementing other capital related initiatives, including focusing on reducing both higher risk-weighted assets and assets currently deducted, or expected to be deducted under Basel III, from capital.  
  On June 17, 2011, U.S. banking regulators proposed rules requiring all large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit a comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The proposed regulations require BHCs to demonstrate adequate capital to support planned capital actions, such as dividends, share repurchases or other forms of distributing capital. CCAR submissions are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may require BHCs to provide prior notice under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution. On January 5, 2012, the Corporation submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve consistent with the proposed rules. 

Table of Contents  

     On July 19, 2011, the Basel Committee published the consultative document  Globally systemic important banks: Assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement  which sets out measures for global, systemically important financial institutions including the methodology for measuring systemic importance, the additional capital required (the SIFI buffer) and the arrangements by which they will be phased in. As proposed, the SIFI buffer would be met with additional Tier 1 common equity ranging from   one percent   to   2.5 percent  , and in certain circumstances,   3.5 percent  . This will be phased in from 2016 through 2018. U.S. banking regulators have not yet provided similar rules for U.S. implementation of a SIFI buffer. 
  Given that the U.S. regulatory agencies have issued neither proposed rulemaking nor supervisory guidance on Basel III, significant uncertainty exists regarding the eventual impacts of Basel III on U.S. financial institutions, including the Corporation. These regulatory changes also require approval by the U.S. regulatory agencies of analytical models used as part of the Corporation s capital measurement and assessment, especially in the case of more complex models. If these more complex models are not approved, it could require financial institutions to hold additional capital, which in some cases could be significant. 
  On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements and the early remediation requirements established under the Financial Reform Act. The enhanced standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, single-counterparty credit limits, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for certain companies determined to pose a threat to financial stability. Comments on the proposed rules are due by March 31, 2012. The final rules are likely to influence the Corporation s regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation. 
    NOTE 19   Employee Benefit Plans 
  Pension and Postretirement Plans 
  The Corporation sponsors noncontributory trusteed pension plans that cover substantially all officers and employees, a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans, and postretirement health and life plans. The plans provide defined benefits based on an employee s compensation and years of service. The Bank of America Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) provides participants with compensation credits, generally based on years of service. For account balances based on compensation credits prior to January 1, 2008, the Pension Plan allows participants to select from various earnings measures, which are based on the returns of certain funds or common stock of the Corporation. The participant-selected earnings measures determine the earnings rate on the individual participant account balances in the Pension Plan. Participants may elect to modify earnings measure allocations on a periodic basis subject to the provisions of the Pension Plan. For account balances based on compensation credits subsequent to December 31, 2007, the account balance earnings rate is based on a benchmark rate. For eligible employees  

in the Pension Plan on or after January 1, 2008, the benefits become vested upon completion of three years of service. It is the policy of the Corporation to fund not less than the minimum funding amount required by ERISA. 
  The Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-selected earnings, applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively provides principal protection for participant balances transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature. 
  As a result of acquisitions, the Corporation assumed the obligations related to the pension plans of certain legacy companies. These acquired pension plans have been merged into a separate defined benefit pension plan which, together with the Pension Plan, are referred to as the Qualified Pension Plans. The benefit structures under these acquired plans have not changed and remain intact in the merged plan. Certain benefit structures are substantially similar to the Pension Plan discussed above; however, certain of these structures do not allow participants to select various earnings measures; rather the earnings rate is based on a benchmark rate. In addition, these benefit structures include participants with benefits determined under formulas based on average or career compensation and years of service rather than by reference to a pension account. Certain of the other benefit structures provide a participant s retirement benefits based on the number of years of benefit service and a percentage of the participant s average annual compensation during the five highest paid consecutive years of the last ten years of employment. 
  In connection with a redesign of the Corporation s retirement plans, after the end of   2011  , the Corporation announced that it will freeze the benefits earned in the Qualified Pension Plans effective June 30, 2012. The Corporation will continue to offer retirement benefits through its defined contribution plans and will increase its contributions to certain of these plans. 
  As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation assumed the obligations related to the plans of Merrill Lynch. These plans include a terminated U.S. pension plan, non-U.S. pension plans, nonqualified pension plans and postretirement plans. The non-U.S. pension plans vary based on the country and local practices. The terminated U.S. pension plan is referred to as the Other Pension Plan.  
  In 1988, Merrill Lynch purchased a group annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits vested under the terminated U.S. pension plan. The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for, or benefit from actual experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The Corporation made no contribution under this agreement in   2011   or   2010  . Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement. 
  The Corporation sponsors a number of noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans (the Nonqualified Pension Plans). As a result of acquisitions, the Corporation assumed the obligations related to the noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans of certain legacy companies including Merrill Lynch. These plans, which are unfunded, provide defined pension benefits to certain employees. 

Table of Contents  

     In addition to retirement pension benefits, full-time, salaried employees and certain part-time employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. Based on the other provisions of the individual plans, certain retirees may also have the cost of these benefits partially paid by the Corporation. The obligations assumed as a result of acquisitions are substantially similar to the Corporation s postretirement health and life plans, except for Countrywide which did not have a postretirement health and life plan. Collectively, these plans are referred to as the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. 
  The Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  . Amounts recognized at   December  

31, 2011 and 2010   are reflected in other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The discount rate assumption is based on a cash flow matching technique and is subject to change each year. This technique utilizes yield curves that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the plans to produce the discount rate assumptions. The asset valuation method for the Qualified Pension Plans recognizes   60 percent   of the prior year s market gains or losses at the next measurement date with the remaining   40 percent   spread equally over the subsequent four years. 
  The Corporation s best estimate of its contributions to be made to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans in   2012   is   $98 million  ,   $124 million   and   $115 million  , respectively. The Corporation does not expect to make a contribution to the Qualified Pension plans in   2012  .

    The measurement date for the Qualified Pension Plans, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans was   December 31   of each year reported.

   Net periodic benefit cost for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009   included the following components. 

n/a = not applicable 
    
    Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was determined using the  projected unit credit  actuarial method. Gains and losses for all benefits except postretirement health care are recognized in accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable accounting guidance. For the Postretirement Health Care Plans,   50 percent   of the unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the fiscal year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis during the year. 
  The discount rate and expected return on plan assets impact the net periodic benefit cost recorded for the plans. With all other assumptions held constant, a 25-basis point decline in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately   $55 million   and   $27 million   for the Qualified Pension Plans. For the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health  

and Life Plans, the 25-basis point decline in rates would not have a significant impact. 
  Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans was   8.00 percent   for   2012  , reducing in steps to   5.00 percent   in 2019 and later years. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased the service and interest costs, and the benefit obligation by   $4 million   and   $59 million   in   2011  . A one-percentage-point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have lowered the service and interest costs, and the benefit obligation by   $3 million   and   $52 million   in   2011  .

    Plan Assets 
  The Qualified Pension Plans have been established as retirement vehicles for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits promised under the Qualified Pension Plans. The Corporation s policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The Corporation s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used  

to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the equity exposure of participant-selected earnings measures. For example, the common stock of the Corporation held in the trust is maintained as an offset to the exposure related to participants who elected to receive an earnings measure based on the return performance of common stock of the Corporation. No plan assets are expected to be returned to the Corporation during   2012  . 
  The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan s assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plan s liabilities. The current planned investment strategy was set following an asset-liability study and advice from the trustee s investment advisors. The selected asset allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy while maintaining a prudent approach to meeting the plan s liabilities. 

Table of Contents  

     The Expected Return on Asset assumption (EROA assumption) was developed through analysis of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds  past experience, and expectations on potential future market returns. The EROA assumption is determined using the calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension Plans and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The EROA assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plans, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar  

year. Some of the building blocks used to arrive at the long-term return assumption include an implied return from equity securities of   8.75 percent  , debt securities of   5.75 percent   and real estate of   7.00 percent   for the Qualified Pension Plans, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The terminated U.S. pension plan is solely invested in a group annuity contract which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration of the plan s obligations. 
  The target allocations for   2012   by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plans, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans are presented in the table below. 

Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plans include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of   $82 million   (  0.55 percent   of total plan assets) and   $189 million   (  1.21 percent   of total plan assets) at   December 31, 2011 and 2010  .

     Defined Contribution Plans 
  The Corporation maintains qualified defined contribution retirement plans and nonqualified defined contribution retirement plans. As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation also maintains the defined contribution plans of Merrill Lynch which include the 401(k) Savings   Investment Plan, the Retirement and Accumulation Plan (RAP) and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The Corporation contributed approximately   $723 million  ,   $670 million   and   $605 million   in   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , respectively, in cash to the qualified defined contribution plans. At   December 31, 2011 and 2010  ,   232 million   shares and   208 million   shares of the Corporation s common stock were held by these plans. Payments to the plans for dividends on common stock were   $9 million  ,   $8 million   and   $8 million   in   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , respectively. 
  In addition, certain non-U.S. employees within the Corporation are covered under defined contribution pension plans that are separately administered in accordance with local laws. 
    NOTE 20   Stock-based Compensation Plans 
  The Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, including the Key Employee Stock Plan, the Key Associate Stock Plan and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan. Descriptions of the significant features of the equity compensation plans are below. Under these plans, the Corporation grants stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock shares and RSUs. For grants in   2011  , restricted stock awards generally vest in   three   equal annual installments beginning one year from the grant date. 
  For most awards, expense is generally recognized ratably over the vesting period net of estimated forfeitures, unless the employee meets certain retirement eligibility criteria. For awards to employees that meet retirement eligibility criteria, the Corporation records the expense upon grant. For employees that become retirement eligible during the vesting period, the Corporation recognizes expense from the grant date to the date on which the employee becomes retirement eligible, net of estimated forfeitures. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was   $2.6 billion  ,   $2.0 billion   and   $2.4 billion   in   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , respectively. The related income tax benefit was   $969 million  ,   $727 million   and   $892 million   for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , respectively. 
  For capital purposes, the Corporation issued approximately   122 million   of immediately tradable shares of common stock, or approximately   $1.0 billion   (after-tax) to certain employees in February 2012 in lieu of a portion of their   2011   year-end cash incentive. 
  Key Employee Stock Plan 
  The Key Employee Stock Plan, as amended and restated, provided for different types of awards including stock options, restricted stock shares and RSUs. Under the plan, 10-year options to purchase approximately   260 million   shares of common stock were granted through   December 31, 2002   to certain employees at the closing market price on the respective grant dates. At   December 31, 2011  , approximately   21 million   fully vested options were outstanding under this plan. No further awards may be granted. 

Key Associate Stock Plan 
  The Key Associate Stock Plan became effective   January 1, 2003  . It provides for different types of awards, including stock options, restricted stock shares and RSUs. As of   December 31, 2011  , the shareholders had authorized approximately   1.1 billion   shares for grant under this plan. Additionally, any shares covered by awards under the Key Employee Stock Plan or certain legacy company plans that cancel, terminate, expire, lapse or settle in cash after a specified date may be re-granted under the Key Associate Stock Plan. 
  During   2011  , the Corporation issued approximately   193 million   RSUs to certain employees under the Key Associate Stock Plan. Certain awards are earned based on the achievement of specified performance criteria. Vested RSUs may be settled in cash or in shares of common stock depending on the terms of the applicable award. In   2011  , approximately   126 million   of these RSUs were authorized to be settled in shares of common stock. Certain awards contain clawback provisions which permit the Corporation to cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. The compensation     cost for cash-settled awards and awards subject to certain clawback provisions is accrued over the vesting period and is adjusted to fair value based upon changes in the share price of the Corporation s common stock. The compensation cost for the remaining awards is fixed and based on the share price of the Corporation s common stock on the date of grant. The Corporation hedges a portion of its exposure to variability in the expected cash flows for certain unvested awards using a combination of economic and cash flow hedges as described in   Note 4   Derivatives  . 
  At   December 31, 2011  , approximately   135 million   options were outstanding under this plan. There were   no   options granted under this plan during   2011   or   2010  . 
  Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan 
  The Corporation assumed the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Approximately   8 million   RSUs were granted in   2011   which generally vest in   three   equal annual installments beginning one year from the grant date. There were   no   shares granted under this plan during   2010  . Awards granted in 2009 generally vest in   three   equal annual installments beginning one year from the grant date, and awards granted prior to 2009 generally vest in   four   equal annual installments beginning one year from the grant date. At   December 31, 2011  , there were approximately   20 million   shares outstanding. 
  Other Stock Plans 
  As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation assumed the obligations of outstanding awards granted under the Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Capital Accumulation Award Plan (FACAAP) and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The FACAAP is no longer an active plan and no awards were granted in   2011   or   2010  . Awards granted in 2003 and thereafter are generally payable   eight   years from the grant date in a fixed number of the Corporation s common shares. For outstanding awards granted prior to 2003, payment is generally made   ten   years from the grant date in a fixed number of the Corporation s common shares unless the fair value of such shares is less than a specified minimum value, in which case the minimum value is paid in cash. At   December 31, 2011  , there were   12 million   shares outstanding under this plan. 

Table of Contents  

     The ESPP allows eligible employees to invest from   one percent   to   10 percent   of eligible compensation to purchase the Corporation s common stock, subject to legal limits. Purchases were made at a discount of   five percent   of the average high and low market price on the relevant purchase date and the maximum annual contribution per employee was   $23,750   in   2011  . Approximately   107 million   shares were authorized for issuance under the ESPP in 2009. There were   6 million   shares available at   December 31, 2011  . 
  The weighted-average fair value of the ESPP stock purchase rights representing the   five percent   discount on the Corporation s common stock purchases exercised by employees in   2011   was   $0.54   per stock purchase right. 
  Restricted Stock/Unit Details 
  The table below presents the status of the share-settled restricted stock/units at   December 31, 2011   and changes during   2011  . 

At   December 31, 2011  , there was   $1.2 billion   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements for all awards and it is expected to be recognized over a period up to   seven   years, with a weighted  

average period of   1.4   years. The total fair value of restricted stock vested in   2011   was   $1.7 billion  . In   2011  , the amount of cash paid to settle equity-based awards was   $489 million  , which included cash-settled RSUs not reflected in the Restricted Stock/Unit Details table.  
  Stock Options 
  The table below presents the status of all option plans at   December 31, 2011   and changes during   2011  . Outstanding options at   December 31, 2011   include   21 million   options under the Key Employee Stock Plan,   135 million   options under the Key Associate Stock Plan and   52 million   options to employees of predecessor company plans assumed in mergers.

    Includes vested shares and nonvested shares after a forfeiture rate is applied. 
       
  At   December 31, 2011  , there was   no   aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of options outstanding was   2.7   years, options exercisable was   2.6   years, and options vested and expected to vest was   2.6   years at   December 31, 2011  . These remaining contractual terms are similar because options have not been granted since 2008 and they generally vest over   three   years.

     NOTE 21   Income Taxes 
  The components of income tax expense (benefit) for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009   were as presented in the table below.  

Total income tax expense (benefit) does not reflect the deferred tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, derivatives and employee benefit plan adjustments that are included in accumulated OCI. As a result of these tax effects, accumulated OCI increased   $3.0 billion   in   2011   and decreased   $3.2 billion   and   $1.6 billion   in   2010   and   2009  . In addition, total income tax expense (benefit) does not reflect tax effects associated with the Corporation s employee stock plans which increased common stock and additional paid-in capital   $19 million   in   2011   and decreased common stock and additional paid-in capital   $98 million   and   $295 million   in   2010   and   2009  . 
  Income tax expense (benefit) for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009   varied from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes. A reconciliation between the expected U.S. federal income tax expense using the federal statutory tax rate of   35 percent   to the Corporation s actual income tax expense (benefit) and resulting effective tax rate for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009   is presented in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense (Benefit) table. 

n/m = not meaningful 
    
  The reconciliation of the beginning unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) balance to the ending balance is presented in the table below.

    The sum per year of positions taken during prior years differs from the   $(239) million  ,   $(349) million   and   $87 million   in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense (Benefit) table due to temporary items and jurisdictional offsets, as well as the inclusion of interest in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense (Benefit) table. 

Table of Contents  

     At   December 31, 2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , the balance of the Corporation s UTBs which would, if recognized, affect the Corporation s effective tax rate was   $3.3 billion  ,   $3.4 billion   and   $4.0 billion  , respectively. Included in the UTB balance are some items the recognition of which would not affect the effective tax rate, such as the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated federal deduction and the portion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that would be offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions. 
  The Corporation files income tax returns in more than   100   state and non-U.S. jurisdictions each year. The IRS and other tax authorities in countries and states in which it has significant business operations examine tax returns periodically (continuously in some jurisdictions). The Tax Examination Status table summarizes the status of significant examinations (U.S. federal unless otherwise noted) for the Corporation and various acquired subsidiaries as of   December 31, 2011  . 

(1)   
    All tax years subsequent to the years shown remain open to examination. 
       
  During   2011  , the Corporation and IRS made significant progress toward resolving all federal income tax examinations for Bank of America Corporation tax years through   2009   and Merrill Lynch tax years through   2008  . While subject to final agreement, including review by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress for certain years, the Corporation believes that all federal examinations in the Tax Examination Status table may be concluded during   2012  . 
  Considering all examinations, it is reasonably possible the UTB balance may decrease by as much as   $2.6 billion   during the next twelve months, since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or recognition. If such decrease were to occur, it likely would primarily result from outcomes consistent with management expectations. 
  During   2011   and   2010  , the Corporation recognized in income tax expense a benefit of   $168 million   and expense of   $99 million   for interest and penalties net-of-tax. At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , the Corporation s accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes, net of taxes and remittances, was   $787 million   and   $1.1 billion  . 

Significant components of the Corporation s net deferred tax assets and liabilities at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   are presented in the Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities table. 

The   2010   U.S. federal deferred tax asset excludes   $56 million   related to certain employee stock plan deductions that was recognized and increased additional paid-in capital in   2011  . 
  The table below summarizes the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances recognized for the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at   December 31, 2011  .   

            (1)   
    The U.K. NOLs may be carried forward indefinitely. 
               (2)   
    The NOLs and related valuation allowances for U.S. states before considering the benefit of federal deductions were   $2.9 billion   and   $1.4 billion  . 

Table of Contents  

     The Corporation concluded that no valuation allowance is necessary to reduce the U.K. NOLs, U.S. NOL and general business credit carryforwards since estimated future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their expiration. During 2011, the valuation allowance decreased due to the utilization of the remaining acquired capital loss carryforward and increased primarily against net operating loss carryforwards in non-U.S. and state jurisdictions. 
  At   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , U.S. federal income taxes had not been provided on   $18.5 billion   and   $17.9 billion   of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries earned prior to 1987 and after 1997 that have been reinvested for an indefinite period of time. If the earnings were distributed, an additional   $2.5 billion   and   $2.6 billion   of tax expense, net of credits for non-U.S. taxes paid on such earnings and for the related non-U.S. withholding taxes, would have resulted as of   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 
    NOTE 22   Fair Value Measurements 
  Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Principles  . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see   Note 23   Fair Value Option  . 
  Level 1, 2 and 3 Valuation Techniques 
  Financial instruments are considered Level 1 when the valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 financial instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
  Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 
  The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of AFS debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets  

and liabilities and AFS debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market s perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies. 
  Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
  The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions used are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation s own credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data. 
  Loans and Loan Commitments 
  The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow calculations may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower. 

Table of Contents  

     Mortgage Servicing Rights 
  The fair values of MSRs are determined using models that rely on estimates of prepayment rates, the resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs and the OAS levels. For more information on MSRs, see   Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights  . 
  Loans Held-for-Sale 
  The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. 
  Other Assets 
  The fair values of AFS marketable equity securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. However, non-public investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted when evidence is available to support such adjustments. 
  Securities Financing Agreements 
  The fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. 

Deposits and Other Short-term Borrowings 
  The fair values of deposits and other short-term borrowings are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spreads in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market. 
  Long-term Debt 
  The Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using valuation models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations between these inputs. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spreads in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary bond market. 
  Asset-backed Secured Financings 
  The fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.

   Recurring Fair Value

    Other assets is primarily comprised of net monoline exposure to a single counterparty and private equity investments. 
       During   2011  , the transfers into Level 3 included   $1.9 billion   of trading account assets,   $1.2 billion   of net derivative assets and   $2.1 billion   of long-term debt accounted for under the fair value option. Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets were primarily certain CLOs, corporate loans and bonds which were transferred due to decreased market activity. Transfers into Level 3 for net derivative assets were the result of changes in the valuation methodology for certain total return swaps, in addition to increases in certain equity derivatives with significant unobservable inputs. Transfers into Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities. Transfers occur on a regular basis for these long-term debt instruments based on the fair value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.  
  During   2011  , the transfers out of Level 3 included   $1.6 billion   of trading account assets,   $6.3 billion   of AFS debt securities,   $4.4 billion   of loans and leases,   $2.0 billion   of other assets and   $1.6  

billion   of long-term debt. Transfers out of Level 3 for trading account assets were primarily driven by increased price observability on certain RMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities and consumer ABS portfolios as well as certain corporate bond positions due to increased trading volume. Transfers out of Level 3 for AFS debt securities primarily related to auto, credit card and student loan ABS portfolios due to increased trading volume in the secondary market for similar securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for loans and leases were driven by increased observable inputs, primarily market comparables, for certain corporate loans accounted for under the fair value option. Transfers out of Level 3 for other assets were primarily the result of an initial public offering of an equity investment. Transfers out of Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities. Transfers occur on a regular basis for these long-term debt instruments based on the fair value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.

Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by reduced price transparency as a result of lower levels of trading activity for certain municipal auction rate securities and corporate debt securities as well as a change in valuation methodology for certain ABS to a discounted cash flow model. Transfers into Level 3 for AFS debt securities were due to an increase in the number of non-agency RMBS and other taxable securities priced using a discounted cash flow model. Transfers into Level 3 for net derivative contracts were primarily related to a lack of price  

observability for certain credit default and total return swaps. Transfers into Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities. 
  During   2010  , the transfers out of Level 3 included   $3.4 billion   of trading account assets and   $1.8 billion   of long-term debt. Transfers out of Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by increased price verification of certain MBS, corporate debt and non-U.S. government and agency securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities.

Nonrecurring Fair Value 
  The Corporation held certain assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are not included in the previous tables in this Note. These assets primarily include LHFS, certain loans and leases, and foreclosed properties. The amounts below represent only balances measured at fair value during   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , and still held as of the reporting date.

    Amounts are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent fair value and related losses on foreclosed properties that were written down subsequent to their initial classification as foreclosed properties. 
               (2)   
    Gains (losses) represent charge-offs on real estate-secured loans. 

NOTE 23   Fair Value Option 
  Loans and Loan Commitments 
  The Corporation elected to account for certain consumer and commercial loans and loan commitments that exceeded the Corporation s single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation s public side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as accounting hedges and therefore are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss). Electing the fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management s view of the underlying economics and the manner in which they are managed. In addition, election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair value. An immaterial portion of the changes in fair value for these loans was attributable to changes in borrower-specific credit risk.  

Table of Contents  

     Loans Held-for-Sale 
  The Corporation elected to account for residential mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and other LHFS under the fair value option with interest income on these LHFS recorded in other interest income. The changes in fair value are largely offset by hedging activities. An immaterial portion of the changes in fair value for these loans was attributable to changes in borrower-specific credit risk. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account for other LHFS under the fair value option primarily because these loans are floating-rate loans that are not economically hedged using derivative instruments.  
  Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets 
  The Corporation elected to account for certain loans that are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option. An immaterial portion of the changes in fair value for these loans was attributable to changes in borrower-specific credit risk. 
  Other Assets 
  The Corporation elected to account for certain private equity investments that are not in an investment company under the fair value option as this measurement basis is consistent with applicable accounting guidance for similar investments that are in an investment company. 
  Securities Financing Agreements 
  The Corporation elected to account for certain securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option based on the tenor of the agreements, which reflects the magnitude of the interest rate risk. The majority of securities financing agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not accounted for under the fair value option as these contracts are generally short-dated and therefore the interest rate risk is not significant. 

Long-term Deposits 
  The Corporation elected to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits that are economically hedged with derivatives under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair value. The Corporation did not elect to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they were not economically hedged using derivatives. 
  Other Short-term Borrowings 
  The Corporation elected to account for certain other short-term borrowings under the fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis. 
  Long-term Debt 
  The Corporation elected to account for certain long-term debt, primarily structured liabilities, under the fair value option. This long-term debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for these financial instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair value. 
  Asset-backed Secured Financings 
  The Corporation elected to account for certain asset-backed secured financings, which are classified in other short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value. 

Table of Contents  

   The table below provides information about the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  . 

(1)   
    The majority of the difference between the fair value carrying amount and contractual principal outstanding at   December 31, 2011   relates to the impact of widening of the Corporation s credit spreads, as well as the fair value of the embedded derivative, where applicable. 
     n/a = not applicable 

Table of Contents  

   The following tables provide information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  . 

(2)    
    Balances in other income (loss) for long-term debt relate to changes in fair value that were attributable to changes in the Corporation s credit spreads. 

NOTE 24   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The fair values of financial instruments have been derived using methodologies described in   Note 22   Fair Value Measurements  . The following disclosures include financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   was carried at fair value on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  Short-term Financial Instruments 
  The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, time deposits placed, federal funds sold and purchased, resale and certain repurchase agreements, and other short-term investments and borrowings approximates the fair value of these instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to limited credit risk and have  

no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market. The Corporation elected to account for certain repurchase agreements under the fair value option. 
  Loans 
  Fair values were generally determined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that the Corporation believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value. The Corporation estimates the cash flows expected to be collected using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate the Corporation s best estimate of current key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds for the life of the loan. The  

Table of Contents  

     carrying value of loans is presented net of the applicable allowance for loan losses and excludes leases. The Corporation elected to account for certain large corporate loans that exceeded the Corporation s single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. 
  Deposits 
  The fair value for certain deposits with stated maturities was determined by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities. The carrying value of non-U.S. time deposits approximates fair value. For deposits with no stated maturities, the carrying value was considered to approximate fair value and does not take into account the significant value of the cost advantage and stability of the Corporation s long-term relationships with depositors. The Corporation accounts for certain long-term fixed-rate deposits that are economically hedged with derivatives under the fair value option. 
  Long-term Debt 
  The Corporation uses quoted market prices, when available, to estimate fair value for its long-term debt. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with similar terms and maturities. The Corporation accounts for certain structured liabilities under the fair value option. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   was carried at fair value are presented in the table below. 

NOTE 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights 
  The Corporation accounts for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income (loss). The Corporation economically hedges these MSRs with certain derivatives and securities including MBS and U.S. Treasuries. The securities that economically hedge the MSRs are classified in other assets with changes in the fair value of the securities and the related interest income recorded in mortgage banking income (loss). 
  The table below presents activity for residential first-lien MSRs for   2011   and   2010  . Commercial and residential reverse MSRs, which are carried at the lower of carrying or market value and accounted for using the amortization method, totaled   $132 million   and   $277 million   at   December 31, 2011   and   2010  , and are not included in the tables in this Note. 

(1)   
    Represents the change in the market value of the MSR asset due to the impact of customer payments received during the period. 
               (2)   
    These amounts reflect changes in the modeled MSR fair value largely due to observed changes in interest rates, volatility, spreads and the shape of the forward swap curve. 
               (3)   
    These amounts reflect periodic adjustments to the valuation model as well as changes in certain cash flow assumptions such as costs to service and ancillary income per loan. 
       
  The Corporation uses an OAS valuation approach which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. The significant economic assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   are presented below. 

Table of Contents  

     The table below presents the sensitivity of the weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the amounts indicate, changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs that continue to be held by the Corporation is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The below sensitivities do not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk.

    NOTE 26   Business Segment Information 
  The Corporation reports the results of its operations through six business segments:   Deposits, Card Services, Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES),   formerly   Home Loans   Insurance, Global Commercial Banking, Global Banking   Markets (GBAM)   and   Global Wealth   Investment Management (GWIM)  , with the remaining operations recorded in   All Other  . The Corporation may periodically reclassify business segment results based on modifications to its management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 
  Deposits 
  Deposits   includes the results of consumer deposits activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. These products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. The Corporation earns net interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using a funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and implied maturity of the deposits.   Deposits   also generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. In addition,   Deposits   includes the net  

impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between   Deposits   and other client-managed businesses. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, service charges and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which deposits were transferred. 
  Card Services 
  Card Services   is one of the leading issuers of credit and debit cards in the U.S. to consumers and small businesses providing a broad offering of lending products including co-branded and affinity products. During 2011, the Corporation sold its Canadian consumer card business and is evaluating its remaining international consumer card operations. In light of these actions, the international consumer card business results were moved to   All Other   effective July 1, 2011, prior periods have been reclassified and the   Global Card Services   business segment was renamed   Card Services  .  
  The Corporation reports its   Card Services   results in accordance with new consolidation guidance that was effective on January 1, 2010. Under this new consolidation guidance, the Corporation consolidated all previously unconsolidated credit card trusts. Accordingly, 2011 and 2010 results are comparable to 2009 results that were presented on a managed basis, which was consistent with the way that management evaluated the results of the business. Managed basis assumed that securitized loans were not sold and presented earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold are presented.  
  Consumer Real Estate Services 
  CRES   provides an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide.   CRES   products include fixed- and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, HELOC and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet in   All Other   for ALM purposes  .   HELOC and home equity loans are retained on the   CRES   balance sheet.   CRES   services mortgage loans, including those loans it owns, loans owned by other business segments and   All Other  , and loans owned by outside investors.  
  The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the business segment that owns the loans or   All Other  .   CRES   is not impacted by the Corporation s first mortgage production retention decisions as   CRES   is compensated for loans held for ALM purposes on a management accounting basis, with a corresponding offset recorded in   All Other  , and for servicing loans owned by other business segments and   All Other  .     CRES   also includes the impact of transferring customers and their related loan balances between   GWIM   and   CRES   based on client segmentation thresholds. Subsequent to the date of transfer, the associated net interest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business segment to which loans were transferred. 
  Global Commercial Banking 
  Global Commercial Banking   provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through the Corporation s network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners. Clients include business banking and middle-market companies, commercial real estate  

Table of Contents  

     firms and governments, and are generally defined as companies with sales up to $2 billion. Lending products and services include commercial loans and commitment facilities, real estate lending, asset-based lending and indirect consumer loans. Capital management and treasury solutions include treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options. In 2011, management responsibility for the merchant services joint venture was moved from   GBAM   to   Global Commercial Banking  . Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the change. 
  Global Banking   Markets 
  GBAM   provides advisory services, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities.   GBAM   also works with commercial and corporate clients to provide debt and equity underwriting and distribution capabilities, merger-related and other advisory services, and risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of the Corporation s market-making activities in these products, it may be required to manage positions in government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, MBS and ABS. Corporate banking services provide a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through the Corporation s network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners. Corporate clients are generally defined as companies with annual sales greater than $2 billion. 
  Global Wealth   Investment Management 
  GWIM   provides comprehensive wealth management capabilities to a broad base of clients from emerging affluent to the ultra-high-net-worth. These services include investment and brokerage services, estate and financial planning, fiduciary portfolio management, cash and liability management and specialty asset management.   GWIM   also provides retirement and benefit plan services, philanthropic management and asset management to individual and institutional clients.   GWIM   results are impacted by the migration of clients and their related deposit and loan balances to or from   Deposits  ,   CRES   and the ALM portfolio. Migration in the current year includes the additional movement of balances to Merrill Edge, which is in   Deposits  . Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the clients migrated.  
  All Other 
  All Other   consists of equity investment activities including Global Principal Investments, Strategic and other investments, and Corporate Investments.   All Other   also includes liquidating businesses, merger and restructuring charges, ALM functions such as residential mortgage portfolio and investment securities and  

related activities, including economic hedges and gains/losses on structured liabilities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally,   All Other   includes certain residential mortgage and discontinued real estate loans that are managed by   CRES  . During 2011, the Corporation sold its Canadian consumer card business and is evaluating its remaining international consumer card operations. As a result of these actions, the international consumer card business results were moved to   All Other   from   Card Services   and prior periods have been reclassified  . 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. 
  Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. For presentation purposes, in segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by the Corporation s ALM activities. 
  The Corporation s ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The majority of the Corporation s ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on performance. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation s internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities. 
  Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.

   The following tables present total revenue, net of interest expense, on a FTE basis and net income (loss) for   2011  ,   2010   and   2009  , and total assets at   December 31, 2011   and   2010   for each business segment, as well as   All Other  .

NOTE 28   Performance by Geographical Area 
  Since the Corporation s operations are highly integrated, certain asset, liability, income and expense amounts must be allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net of interest expense, income (loss) before income taxes and net income (loss) by geographic area. The Corporation identifies its geographic performance based on the business unit structure used to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region as applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the allocation of revenue so that revenue can be appropriately matched with the related expense or capital deployed in the region.

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report and pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange  

Act), Bank of America s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness and design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, Bank of America s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Bank of America s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    To the Board of Directors of Bank of America Corporation: 
  We have examined, based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, Bank of America Corporation s (the  Corporation ) assertion, included under Item 9A, that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   December 31, 2011   ( Management s Assertion ). Disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and for Management s Assertion of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Management s Assertion based on our examination. 
  There are inherent limitations to disclosure controls and procedures. Because of these inherent limitations, effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the intended objectives. Disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent, or detect and correct, material misstatements, and they may not identify all information relating to the Corporation to be accumulated and communicated to the Corporation s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Also, projections of any evaluation  

of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  We conducted our examination in accordance with attestation standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective disclosure controls and procedures were maintained in all material respects. Our examination included obtaining an understanding of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures based on the assessed risk. Our examination also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination was not conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion, and accordingly we express no opinion, on the accuracy or completeness of the Corporation s disclosures in its reports, or whether such disclosures comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  In our opinion, Management s Assertion that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   December 31, 2011   is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

(1)   
    This table does not include outstanding options to purchase 4,297,762 shares of the Corporation s common stock that were assumed by the Corporation in connection with prior acquisitions, under whose plans the options were originally granted. The weighted-average option price of these assumed options was $90.83 at December 31, 2011. Also, at December 31, 2011 there were 178,052 vested deferred restricted stock units associated with these plans. No additional awards were granted under these plans following the respective dates of acquisition. 
               (2)   
    This table does not include outstanding options to purchase 6,929,892 shares of the Corporation s common stock that were assumed by the Corporation in connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition, which were originally issued under certain Merrill Lynch plans. The weighted-average option price of these assumed options was $48.28 at December 31, 2011. Also, at December 31, 2011 there were 12,268,366 outstanding restricted stock units and 1,598,151 vested deferred restricted stock units and stock option gain deferrals associated with such plans. These Merrill Lynch plans were frozen at the time of the acquisition and no additional awards may be granted under these plans. However, as previously approved by the Corporation s shareholders, if any of the outstanding awards under these frozen plans subsequently are canceled, forfeited or settled in cash, the shares relating to such awards thereafter will be available for future awards issued under the Corporation s Key Associate Stock Plan (KASP). 
               (3)   
    Includes 220,749,862 outstanding restricted stock units under plans approved by the Corporation s shareholders and 20,827,283 outstanding restricted stock units under plans not approved by the Corporation s shareholders. 
               (4)   
    Does not reflect restricted stock units included in the first column, which do not have an exercise price. 
               (5)   
    Includes 432,578,282 shares of common stock available for future issuance under the KASP (including 26,499,396 shares originally subject to awards outstanding under frozen Merrill Lynch plans at the time of the acquisition which subsequently have been canceled, forfeited or settled in cash and become available for issuance under the KASP, as described in footnote (2) above) and 585,977 shares of common stock which are available for future issuance under the Corporation s Directors  Stock Plan. 
               (6)   
    In connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation assumed and has continued to issue awards in accordance with applicable NYSE listing standards under the following plans, which were not approved by the Corporation s shareholders: the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan (ESCP) and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), both of which were approved by Merrill Lynch s shareholders prior to the acquisition. The material features of these plans are described below under the heading  Description of Plans Not Approved by the Corporation s Shareholders.  
        Description of Plans Not Approved by the Corporation s Shareholders 
  Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan   (ESCP). The ESCP covers employees who were salaried key employees of Merrill Lynch or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective date of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, other than executive officers. Under the ESCP, the Corporation may award restricted shares, restricted units, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and stock appreciation rights. Awards of restricted shares and restricted units are subject to a vesting schedule specified in the grant documentation. Restricted shares and restricted units under the ESCP may generally be canceled prior to the vesting date in the event of (i) violation of covenants specified in the grant documentation (including, but not limited to, non-competition, non-solicitation, nondisparagement and confidentiality covenants) or (ii) termination of employment prior to the end of the vesting period (except in certain limited circumstances, such as death, disability and retirement). Options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the ESCP expire not more than 10 years from the date of grant, and the applicable grant documentation specifies the extent to which options may be exercised during their respective terms, including in the event of an employee s death, disability or termination of employment. Shares that are canceled, forfeited or settled in cash from an additional frozen Merrill Lynch plan also will become available for grant under the ESCP. 
  Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Purchase Plan   (ESPP). The purpose of the ESPP is to give employees employed by Merrill Lynch or an eligible subsidiary an opportunity to purchase the Corporation s common stock through payroll deductions (an  

employee can elect either payroll deductions of one percent to 10 percent of current compensation or an annual dollar amount equal to a maximum of 10 percent of current eligible compensation). Shares are purchased quarterly at 95 percent of the fair market value (average of the highest and lowest share prices) on the date of the purchase and the maximum annual contribution is $23,750. An employee is eligible to participate if he or she was employed by Merrill Lynch or any participating subsidiary for at least 12 months prior to the start of the new plan year.

  This Performance Contingent Restricted Stock Units Award Agreement and all Exhibits hereto (the  Agreement ) is made between Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( Bank of America ), and you, an employee of Bank of America or one of its Subsidiaries. 
    
  Bank of America sponsors the Bank of America Corporation 2003 Key Associate Stock Plan (the  Stock Plan ). A Prospectus describing the Stock Plan has been delivered to you. The Stock Plan itself is available upon request, and its terms and provisions are incorporated herein by reference. When used herein, the terms which are defined in the Stock Plan shall have the meanings given to them in the Stock Plan, as modified herein (if applicable).  
    
  The Restricted Stock Units covered by this Agreement are being awarded to you with respect to Performance Year 2011, subject to the following terms and provisions. 
    
    2012 Performance Contingent Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement 

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement, Bank of America awards to you the number of Restricted Stock Units shown above. Each Restricted Stock Unit shall have a value equal to the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Bank of America common stock. 
    
  2. You acknowledge having read the Prospectus and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement. 
    
  3. The Restricted Stock Units covered by this Award shall become earned by, and payable to, you in the amounts and on the dates shown on the enclosed Exhibit A. 
    
  4. If a cash dividend is paid with respect to Bank of America common stock, a cash dividend equivalent equal to the total cash dividend you would have received had your Restricted Stock Units been actual shares of Bank of America common stock will be accumulated and paid in cash through payroll when the Restricted Stock Units become earned and payable. Dividend equivalents are credited with interest at the three-year constant maturity Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant until the payment date. 
    
  5. You agree that you shall comply with (or provide adequate assurance as to future compliance with) all applicable securities laws as determined by Bank of America as a condition precedent to the delivery of any shares of Bank of America common stock pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, you agree that, upon request, you will furnish a letter agreement providing that (i) you will not distribute or resell any of said shares in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (ii) you will indemnify and hold Bank of America harmless against all liability for any such violation and (iii) you will accept all liability for any such violation. 
    
  6. You agree that the Award covered by this Agreement is subject to the Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy set forth in the Bank of America Corporate Governance Guidelines. To the extent allowed by and consistent with applicable law and any applicable limitations period, if it is determined at any time that you have engaged in Detrimental Conduct or engaged in any hedging or derivative transactions involving Bank of America common stock in violation of the Bank of America Corporation Code of Ethics that would undermine the long-term performance incentives created by the Award, Bank of America will be entitled to recover from you in its sole discretion some or all of the shares of Bank of America common stock (and any related dividend equivalents) paid to you pursuant to this Agreement. You recognize that if you engage in Detrimental Conduct or any hedging or derivative transactions involving Bank of America common stock, the losses to Bank of America and/or its Subsidiaries may amount to the full value of any shares of Bank of America common stock (and any related dividend equivalents) paid to you pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, Awards are subject to the requirements of (i) Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (regarding recovery of erroneously awarded compensation) and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) similar rules under the laws of any other jurisdiction and (iii) any policies adopted by Bank of America to implement such requirements, all to the extent determined by Bank of America in its discretion to be applicable to you.

If you do not designate a beneficiary or if your designated beneficiary does not survive you, then your beneficiary will be your estate.

  10. Regardless of any action Bank of America or your employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding ( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items owed by you is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Bank of America or your employer. You further acknowledge that Bank of America and/or your employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the grant of Restricted Stock Units, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units and the receipt of any dividends and/or dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items. Further, if you have become subject to the Tax-Related Items in connection with the Award in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Bank of America or your employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
    
  In the event Bank of America determines that it and/or your employer must withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of your participation in the Stock Plan, you agree as a condition of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units to make arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America and/or your employer to enable it to satisfy all withholding requirements, including, but not limited to, withholding any applicable Tax-Related Items from the pay-out of the Restricted Stock Units.

    14

If such Participant is eligible for Early Retirement on the date such Participant is deemed to have separated from Service, then subject to the provisions of Section 4.7 and Article VI such Participant shall become entitled to such Participant's Early Retirement Benefit determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 and Section 4.5(b).

    17 

(ii)    sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the deceased Participant's Target Retirement Benefit, reduced in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(b)(17) as though the Participant had retired on the date of the Participant's death, minus the sum of (A) the monthly life annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the benefits payable to such Eligible Spouse from the Retirement Plan and the ERISA Supplemental Plan and (B) sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the deceased Participant's Social Security Benefit. 
  In the event that the Eligible Spouse dies prior to the time the last Child of the deceased Participant attains age twenty-one (21), then in addition to the foregoing benefit, the Family Death Benefit shall be paid after the death of the Eligible Spouse until the Family Death Benefit Termination Date in the manner set forth in Section 4.6(c)(1)(A).

  (e)      Article VI Controlling  . The provisions of this Section 4.6 shall be subject to the provisions of Article VI. 
    18 

Section 4.7.      Adjustment in Benefits  . 
  (a)      Reduction in Benefits Based on Spouse's Age  . In the event (i) a married Participant's spouse is more than ten (10) years younger than such Participant at the time such Participant becomes entitled to commence receiving such Participant's Normal Retirement Benefit provided for in Section 4.2, Early Retirement Benefit provided for in Section 4.3 or Delayed Retirement Benefit provided for in Section 4.4, as applicable, or (ii) an Eligible Spouse entitled to receive a Family Death Benefit provided for in Section 4.6(c) is more than ten (10) years younger than the deceased Participant at the time of such deceased Participant's death, the benefit which such Participant is otherwise entitled to receive (and the survivor annuity of such Participant's spouse), or the benefit to which such Eligible Spouse is entitled, as applicable, shall be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying such benefit by the percentage amount determined from the table attached hereto as Exhibit A based on the age difference between such Participant and such Participant's spouse. 
  (b)      Recalculation of Benefits  . A Participant's Assumed Retirement Benefit, Retirement Plan Death Benefit and Long Term Disability Plan Benefit can vary from time to time under the terms of the Retirement Plan, ERISA Supplemental Plan and Long Term Disability Plan or because of possible future amendments to such Plans at the election of the Participating Employers or as may be required by applicable law. As of each date on which any benefit payable to a Participant (or his spouse or Beneficiary) under the Retirement Plan, ERISA Supplemental Plan or Long Term Disability Plan changes for any reason, there shall be a recalculation of the benefits, if any, payable under this Plan (based on the assumptions contained herein) to such Participant (or his spouse or Beneficiary) using the benefits then payable under the Retirement Plan, ERISA Supplemental Plan and Long Term Disability Plan as a result of such changes. Such increased or decreased benefits payable under this Plan shall become effective at the same time as the change in benefits under the Retirement Plan, the ERISA Supplemental Plan and the Long Term Disability Plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.7(b), once a Participant's Social Security Benefit is determined for purposes of determining benefits payable under this Plan, such benefits shall not be subject to recalculation after benefits commence under the terms of this Plan due to increases or decreases in benefits payable from time to time under the Federal Social Security Act. 
    19 

Section 4.8.      Special Benefit  . The Participating Employers sponsor the Deferred Compensation Plan for the benefit of their key employees. In the event an Employee of the Participating Employers who has been designated as eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan elects to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan by deferring Compensation pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, any Compensation which is deferred pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan is ineligible to be taken into consideration as  compensation  under the terms of the Thrift Plan for purposes of determining the maximum amount of a Participant's salary reduction contributions under the terms of the Thrift Plan. Under the terms of the Thrift Plan, salary reduction contributions up to six percent (6%) of  compensation  as defined in the Thrift Plan are eligible for a fifty percent (50%)  matching contribution  by the Participating Employers, that is, a  matching contribution  of three percent (3%) of such Participant's  compensation.  To the extent (i) a Participant in this Plan also participates in the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Thrift Plan and (ii) such Participant is contributing at least six percent (6%) of  compensation  as a salary reduction contribution to the Thrift Plan, then any  matching contribution  by the Participating Employers which such Participant would have received under the terms of the Thrift Plan (after applying the terms of the Thrift Plan related to limitations on salary reduction and matching contributions under Sections 402(g) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) had such Participant contributed six percent (6%) of the  Compensation  deferred pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan to the Thrift Plan shall be credited to a reserve account on the books and records of the Participating Employers as of the last day of the calendar year in which such  matching contribution  would have been made by the Participating Employers under the Thrift Plan. The amount credited to such account each year shall bear interest from the first day of such calendar year at the rate of thirteen percent (13%) compounded annually. Upon a Participant's separation from Service for any reason or upon a Participant becoming Disabled, the amount of such reserve account (including any addition for the year in which separation from Service or Disability occurs) shall be paid to such Participant (or in the event of such Participant's death, to such Participant's Beneficiary) in such manner as the Plan Committee shall determine in its sole and exclusive discretion over a period of five (5) years following such Participant's separation from Service or such Participant becoming Disabled. Interest shall accrue with respect to the unpaid balance of such reserve account during such payment period  
    
    20 

through the last day of the month preceding the month in which the unpaid balance is paid in full. In addition to the foregoing, a Participant who separates from Service after attaining age sixty (60) and completing three hundred (300) months of Creditable Service shall receive a supplemental monthly benefit equal to such Participant's monthly Social Security Benefit until such Participant attains age sixty-two (62). 
  Section 4.9.      Beneficiary or Beneficiaries  . 
  (a)      Designation or Change of Beneficiary by a Participant  . Each Participant may from time to time designate the person(s) or entity(ies) to whom the death benefits provided for in Section 4.6(c)(1)(B), Section 4.6(c)(2)(B) and Section 4.8 are to be paid. A Participant may from time to time change such Participant's said designation of Beneficiary and upon any such change, any previously designated Beneficiary's right to receive any benefits under the Plan shall terminate. In order to be effective, any designation or change of designation of a Beneficiary must be made on a form furnished by the Plan Committee and signed by the Participant and received by the Plan Committee while the Participant is alive. If a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant shall survive the deceased Participant but die prior to the receipt of all benefits payable to said Beneficiary under the Plan, then such benefits as would have been payable to said deceased Beneficiary shall be paid to such Beneficiary's estate at the same time and in the same manner as such benefits would have been payable to said deceased Beneficiary. 
  (b)      Beneficiary Designated by the Plan  . In the event that a Participant shall die without having designated a Beneficiary, or in the event that a Participant shall die having revoked an earlier Beneficiary Designation without having effectively designated another Beneficiary, or in the event that a Participant shall die but the Beneficiary designated by such Participant shall fail to survive such Participant, then and in any such event, the person(s) who shall constitute the Beneficiary of such deceased Participant shall be determined as follows: 
  (i)    In the event said deceased Participant is survived by a Child, Children or by issue of a deceased Child or Children, such surviving Children and surviving issue of such deceased Children shall share as Beneficiaries on a per stirpes basis, the issue of a deceased Child of the deceased Participant to take per stirpes the same share their parent would have taken if living. 
  (ii)    In the event said deceased Participant is not survived by any person described in subparagraph (i), then said deceased Participant's estate shall be such deceased Participant's Beneficiary. 
    21 

Section 4.10.        Benefits Payable After Change of Control and Special Single Sum Benefit  . In the event of a Change of Control, 
  (i)        benefit accruals (except as provided below) and payments under the Plan, respectively, shall cease for each Participant or, if a Participant is deceased, such deceased Participant's Beneficiary, spouse or Eligible Spouse, as the case may be, who is then receiving, or is entitled to receive, benefits under the Plan at such date; 
  (ii)        the Commuted Payment Amount on the date of such Change of Control shall be determined in accordance with the provisions set forth in   Exhibit B   hereto with respect to each such party; 
  (iii)        such Commuted Payment Amount (plus interest on such amount at that GATT Rate (as defined in   Exhibit B   hereto) compounded annually from the date of the Change of Control to the date of payment) shall be paid in a single sum cash payment to such party within the sixty (60) day period immediately following either (A) the date the Participant separates from Service in the event the Participant has not separated from Service at the date of such Change of Control or (B) the date of such Change of Control in the event the Participant has separated from Service at the date of such Change of Control; and 
  (iv)        the Plan shall terminate as of the date all such payments have been made. 
  Further, whether or not a Change of Control has occurred, upon or after Participant's separation from Service, the Compensation Committee, in its sole and exclusive discretion, may pay in a single sum cash payment to that Participant (or if the Participant is deceased, such deceased Participant's Beneficiary, spouse or Eligible Spouse, as the case may be, who is then receiving, or is entitled to receive, benefits under the Plan) on a determination date specified by the Compensation Committee the Commuted Payment Amount that such party would have been entitled to receive had a Change of Control occurred on such determination date, in which event such party's participation in the Plan shall terminate as of such date. 
    Section 4.11.        Certain Reduction of Payments  .  
    (a)        It is the intention of the Participating Employers and the Participants to reduce the amounts payable or distributable to a Participant hereunder if the aggregate Net After Tax  
    22 

Receipts (as defined below) to the Participant would thereby be increased, as a result of the application of the excise tax provisions of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and valid Treasury regulations thereunder (the  Code ). Accordingly, anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the certified public accountants regularly employed by Bank of America Corporation immediately prior to any  change  described below (the  Accounting Firm ) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below) would subject the Participant to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether some amount of Payments would meet the definition of a  Reduced Amount  (as defined below). If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph (c) below. 
  (b)    For purposes of this Section 4.11 (i) a  Payment  shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation to or for the benefit of a Participant who is a  disqualified individual  within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and which is contingent on a  change  described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code with respect to the Corporation, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or otherwise; (ii)  Plan Payment  shall mean a Payment paid or payable pursuant to this Plan (disregarding this Section 4.11); (iii)  Net After Tax Receipt  shall mean the Present Value of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on the Participant with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code which applied to the Participant's federal taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year; (iv)  Present Value  shall mean such value determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code; and (v)  Reduced Amount  shall mean the smallest aggregate amount of Payments which (a) is less than the sum of all Payments and (b) results in aggregate Net After Tax Receipts which are equal to or greater than the Net After Tax Receipts which would result if all Payments were paid to or for the benefit of the Participant. 
  (c)    If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Compensation Committee shall promptly give the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof, and the Participant may then elect, in the Participant's sole discretion, which and how much of the Payments, including without limitation Plan Payments, shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the present value of the aggregate Payments is equal to the Reduced Amount), and shall advise the  
    
    23 

Compensation Committee in writing of such election within ten (10) days of the Participant's receipt of notice. If no such election is made by the Participant within such ten (10) day period, the Compensation Committee may elect which of the Payments, including without limitation Plan Payments, shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Present Value of the aggregate Payments is equal to the Reduced Amount) and shall notify the Participant promptly of such election. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 4.11 shall be binding upon the Participating Employers and the Participant and shall be made within sixty (60) days immediately following that event constituting the  change  referred to above. As promptly as practicable following such determination, the Participating Employers shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Participant such Payments as are then due to the Participant under this Plan. 
  (d)    At the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Participating Employers to or for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan which should not have been so paid or distributed ( Overpayment ) or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Participating Employers to or for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or distributed ( Underpayment ), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based either upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against a Participating Employer or the Participant which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success or controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Participating Employers to or for the benefit of the Participant shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio to the Participant which the Participant shall repay to the Participating Employer together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Participant to the Participating Employer if and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Participating  
    24 

Employer to or for the benefit of the Participant together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 
  Section 4.12.      Special Election of Single Lump Sum or Installment Payments  . 
  (a)      Alternative Methods of Payment  . Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, a Participant may elect from time to time pursuant to this Section 4.12 to have the single sum value (the  Lump Sum Benefit Amount ) of the benefits payable under Section 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4 upon the Participant's Retirement or the benefits payable under Section 4.6 upon the Participant's death while in Service [or, to the extent provided in Section 4.6(b), while Disabled] paid in accordance with one of the following methods of payment, in lieu of the method otherwise applicable under the provisions of this Article IV: 
  (i)    single lump sum payment; 
  (ii)    five (5) annual installments; or 
  (iii)    ten (10) annual installments. 
  Unless deferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.12(c), the payment(s) to be made to a Participant pursuant to the Participant's alternative method of payment election under this Section shall commence immediately upon the Participant's Retirement or death while in Service.  
  (b)      Determination of Lump Sum Benefit Amount and Amount of Installment Payments  . The Lump Sum Benefit Amount shall be equal to (i) in the event of a Participant's Retirement, the Commuted Payment Amount determined for the Participant as of the date of the Participant's Retirement or (ii) in the event of a Participant's death while in Service [or, to the extent provided in Section 4.6(b), while Disabled], the actuarially equivalent single sum value of the benefits (if any) provided for in Section 4.6(c) determined as of the date of the Participant's death using assumptions consistent with those set forth in   Exhibit B   to the Plan. The amount of each annual installment payment payable under Section 4.12(a) shall be the amount necessary to amortize the Participant's Lump Sum Benefit Amount in equal annual installments over the selected period using the GATT Rate (as defined in   Exhibit B   hereto) in effect for the calendar year of the Participant's Retirement or death. 
  (c)      Deferral of Lump Sum Payment Date  .  
    
    25 

(i)      Elective Deferral  . Any Participant who elects payment of the Participant's benefit in a single lump sum may also elect to defer receipt of such payment until March 31 of the year following the Participant's Retirement or death (as the case may be). 
  (ii)      Deferral Period Interest  . The amount of any single lump sum payment that is deferred under this Section 4.12(c) shall be the Participant's Lump Sum Benefit Amount determined under Section 4.12(b) plus interest at the GATT Rate (as defined in   Exhibit B   hereto) in effect for the calendar year of the Participant's Retirement or death compounded annually to the date of payment. 
  (d)      Timing of Elections and Effective Date  . An alternative method of payment election under Section 4.12(a) and any deferral election under Section 4.12(c)(i) may be made at any time and from time to time after the date the Participant attains age fifty-four (54). Any such election shall be made on such form and pursuant to such procedures as are adopted by the Plan Committee for such purpose and shall become effective upon the first anniversary of the date such election is made. Any change in such an election shall not become effective until the first anniversary of the date the new election is made. 
  Section 4.13.      Coordination with Texas SERP  . In the event a Participant is to receive a benefit under this Plan and a benefit under the NationsBank of Texas, N.A. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the  Texas SERP ), the Participant's benefits under this Plan shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the benefits payable under the Texas SERP. For purposes of determining this dollar for dollar reduction, the Texas SERP benefit shall be converted to the normal form of payment under this Plan.

  (a)    any Participant who commenced receiving benefits under the Plan prior to the amendment or termination date and is alive on the amendment or termination date and the spouse or Beneficiary of such Participant; or 
  (b)    any spouse or Beneficiary who commenced receiving benefits under the Plan prior to the amendment and termination date. 
  In addition, with respect to all other Participants in the Plan on such amendment or termination who have not commenced receiving benefits under the Plan prior to the amendment or termination date, any such amendment or termination shall not result in such Participant receiving benefits under the Plan upon such Participant's separation from Service which are less than the benefits such Participant would have received under the Plan but for such amendment or termination multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is such Participant's Creditable Service at the time of such amendment or termination and the denominator of which is the Creditable Service such Participant would have accumulated as a Participant if such Participant had continued as a Participant until such Participant had attained age sixty-two (62). Except as hereinabove expressly provided to the contrary in this Section 6.4, the Plan may be amended or terminated so that no benefits or (if such amendment or termination so provides) reduced benefits shall be payable to any Participant, spouse or Beneficiary after the effective date of such amendment or termination.

  Single Sum Value ( AESSV ) 
    
  In accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(b)(47) and, Section 4.10, the following procedures shall be used to determine the AESSV of the benefit rights of each subject Participant, Beneficiary, spouse or Eligible Spouse under the Plan. 
    
  I.    Individuals Not in Payment Status 
  A.    Participants under Age 55 
  The AESSV shall be determined as follows: 
           1. 
    Determine the Participant's Target Benefit as of the date of the Change of Control or other determination date (hereinafter collectively referred to as the  Determination Date ) based on such Participant's Creditable Service as of the Determination Date; 
              2. 
    Determine the Participant's Assumed Retirement Benefit as of the Determination Date on the basis of the Participant's Accrued Benefit payable at age 55 under the Retirement Plan and the ERISA Supplemental Plan; 
              3. 
    Determine the Participant's projected Early Retirement Benefit at age 55 using the Target Benefit and the Assumed Retirement Benefit obtained in A.(1) and (2) above determined without regard to the age and service requirements to Early Retirement under the Plan; 
              4. 
    Determine the projected AESSV at age 55 of the Early Retirement Benefit obtained in A.(3) above in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3, and in the case of a Participant who is married on the Determination Date, using the age of the Participant's spouse on the date that the Participant would have attained age 55; and 
              5. 
    Determine the AESSV by discounting the projected AESSV obtained in A.(4) above at the  GATT Rate  (as hereinafter defined) compounded annually from the date the Participant would have attained age 55 to the Determination Date. For purposes of this   Exhibit B  , the  GATT Rate  means the  applicable interest rate  as defined in Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, as amended by the Retirement Protection Act of 1994. The  lookback month  (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation   1.417(e)-IT(d)(4)(iii)) for the determination of the applicable interest rate for benefit payments commencing during a calendar year shall be the immediately preceding September. The  stability period  (within the  

meaning of Treasury Regulation   1.417(e)-IT(d)(4)(ii)) during which the applicable interest rate remains constant shall be the calendar year immediately succeeding the lookback month. 
           6. 
    With respect to a Disabled Participant, assume for purposes of the above determination that such Participant returned to active service on the Determination Date. 
     B.    Participants Age 55 or Over 
  The AESSV shall be determined as follows: 
           1. 
    Determine the Participant's Target Benefit as of the Determination Date based on such Participant's Creditable Service as of the Determination Date; 
              2. 
    Determine the Participant's Early Retirement Benefit payable as of the Determination Date using the Target Benefit obtained in B.(1) above determined without regard to the service requirement applicable to Early Retirement under the Plan; and 
              3. 
    Determine the AESSV at the Determination Date of the Early Retirement Benefit obtained in B.(2) above in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3. 
              4. 
    With respect to a Disabled Participant, assume for purposes of the above determination that such Participant returned to active service on the Determination Date. 
     II.        Individuals in Payment Status 
  Determine the AESSV in accordance with the amount and terms of payment of current and prospective benefits to the subject Participant, Beneficiary, spouse, or Eligible Spouse. 
  III.        Other Assumptions 
  All AESSVs shall be determined on the basis of the GATT Rate (as defined in I.A.(5) above) compounded annually. To the extent that benefits are payable over the lifetime(s) of one or more individuals, the AESSV shall also be based on the  applicable mortality table,  as defined in Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, as amended by the Retirement Protection Act of 1994.

    The amount of all retirement benefits considered as part of the Assumed Retirement Benefit under the Plan (including without limitation any Assumed Retirement Benefit related to the Boatmen's SERP for any Affected Participant's with benefits accrued under that plan) shall be determined without regard to any compensation or service for periods beginning after December 31, 2002; provided, however, that for purposes of determining the amount of an Affected Participant's  Pension Account  under the Retirement Plan and  Restoration Account  under the ERISA Supplemental Plan as of December 31, 2002, the balances in those accounts shall be determined as of November 22, 2002 and shall be increased for (A) compensation credits to be received under those plans during the period from November 23, 2002 through December 31, 2002 plus (B) interest at the rate specified in Section 6 of this Exhibit for the period from November 23, 2002 through December 31, 2002.

  Adjustments for Early Commencement  . If an Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit is to commence before the Affected Participant's Normal Retirement Date, then the  

2 

      amount of the Frozen Plan Benefit shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the early commencement of such benefits. 
    
  Adjustments for Late Commencement  . If an Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit is to commence after the Affected Participant's Normal Retirement Date, then the amount of the Frozen Plan Benefit shall be actuarially increased to reflect the delayed commencement of such benefits. 
    
    (c)        Optional Forms of Payment  . An Affected Participant may elect in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph (c) one of the following optional forms of payment for the Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit: 
    
           (i) 
    a single lump sum payment;

    five (5) annual installments; or 
       
           (iii)

If the Affected Participant separates from Service on or after the Affected Participant's Normal Retirement Date, the amount of the lump sum payment shall be equal to the actuarially equivalent present value of the Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit determined as of the date of separation from Service assuming the Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit is payable in the form of an immediate annuity. 
    
  The amount of installment payments shall be based on the lump sum amount of the Frozen Plan Benefit as set forth above amortized as equal annual payments over the applicable payment period using for such purpose the interest rate specified in Section 6 of this Exhibit. 
    
  The single cash payment or initial installment payment, as applicable, shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after the Affected Participant's date of separation from Service, and each subsequent installment payment (if applicable) shall be made on or around the anniversary of the first payment date. 

3 

      An election for an optional form of payment under this subparagraph shall become effective on the date that is twelve (12) months (or such lesser period as the Corporation's Personnel Group may determine in its discretion consistent with the Corporation's intent that benefits be subject to taxation as and when actually received by the Affected Participant) after the date that the election is made if the Affected Participant remains in Service throughout that period. Any such election shall be made on such form, at such time and pursuant to such procedures as determined by the Personnel Group in its sole discretion from time to time. An Affected Participant may not have more than two (2) payment elections pending under this subparagraph at any one time. If no such election is effective as of the date of the Affected Participant's separation from Service, payment shall be in the normal form of annuity described above.

    (a)        Death After Commencement of Benefits  .

In that regard, if the Affected Participant was receiving installment payments under Section 4(c) of this Exhibit immediately prior to death, the remaining unpaid installments shall continue to be paid to the Affected Participant's Beneficiary, unless the Corporation determines to pay the actuarially equivalent present value of the remaining unpaid installments in a single lump sum payment. 
    
    (b)        Death Before Commencement of Benefits  . If an Affected Participant dies before having commenced payment of the Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit, then the actuarially equivalent present value of the Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit determined as of the date of death shall be payable to the Affected Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum payment as soon as administratively practicable after death. However, the Affected Participant may elect in accordance with such procedures as the Personnel Group may establish from time to time to have such death benefits payable to the Affected Participant's Beneficiary in five (5) or ten (10) annual installments (with the amount of each installment determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 above) or in an actuarially equivalent single life annuity on the life of the Beneficiary. 
    
  6.        Actuarial Equivalency  . For purposes of this Exhibit, all determinations of actuarial equivalency shall based on the following mortality and interest assumptions: 
    
  Mortality  : 1983 GAM Unisex Mortality Table 
  Interest  : 5.48% per annum, compounded annually 
    
  For purposes of determining (i) the actuarial adjustment for early or late commencement of an Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit as set forth in Section 4(b) of this Exhibit and (ii) the actuarially equivalent present value of an Affected Participant's Frozen Plan Benefit under Section 4(c) or Section 5 of this Exhibit, if the Affected Participant has not attained age fifty (50) as of December 31, 2002, the Affected Participant shall be deemed to have attained age fifty (50) as of the Affected Participant's birthday occurring during 2002.

The applicable make-whole loss amount set forth in the loss reimbursement statement shall not include (and to the extent inadvertently included, Lender shall be entitled to a credit for) the actual mortgage insurance coverage amount with respect to such MI Rescission Mortgage set forth on the revised   Schedules 2A, 2B and 2C   to be delived on or before January 14, 2011, it being the intent of Lenders and Fannie Mae that Fannie Mae has been paid the applicable mortgage insurance coverage amount and will not collect it again in connection with a Lender's satisfaction of its Repurchase Obligations. 
       
           (2) 
    Certain other Covered Mortgages.   To the extent that Fannie Mae determines that any Data and Shipping Error Mortgage, IC Fee Reconciliation Mortgage or a Documented MD/NC Mortgage has a breach of a Remaining Selling Rep   Warrant Obligation (including the rescission of any required mortgage insurance), the Lender that sold to Fannie Mae, and the Lender that services, such mortgage shall remain liable for the breach of such Remaining Selling Rep   Warrant Obligation in accordance with the Contract, including for all Repurchase Obligations arising with respect to such Remaining Selling Rep   Warrant Obligations.  
       10 

c. 
    Servicing Advances  . All servicing advances made by a Lender pursuant to the Servicing Guide with respect to Covered Mortgages (and with respect to Remaining Pipeline Mortgages, irrespective of how characterized on Fannie Mae's internal systems) shall be addressed and reimbursed in accordance with Fannie Mae's standard processes and procedures as set forth in the Guides, including all applicable curtailments. 
       
           d. 
    Contest of MI Rescissions  . 
       
           (1) 
    In connection with all MI Rescission Mortgages and any other Covered Mortgages for which mortgage insurance is subsequently rescinded, the Lender who is the seller or servicer of such Covered Mortgage shall use all reasonable efforts, as determined in their discretion, to contest such rescission. Lender shall notify Fannie Mae in writing when it has determined that it is unlikely that the mortgage insurer will reinstate the mortgage insurance, despite such Lender's reasonable efforts.  
       
           (2) 
    In no event shall any Lender be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to any MI Rescission Mortgages, Policy Misalignment Makewhole Mortgages, and Remaining Pipeline Mortgages on account of such mortgage insurance being rescinded or the inability to reinstate such insurance. Nothing contained in this Section 4(d) shall be deemed to be  Other Obligations  as defined herein nor shall the breach thereof give rise to any remedy available to Fannie Mae against any Lender in its capacity as seller or servicer under the Contracts. The sole and exclusive remedy for the alleged breach of any covenant in this Section 4(d) shall be a claim under this Agreement against the Lender committing the breach, and the maximum damage for any such claim will be the amount that Fannie Mae would have received from a private mortgage insurer had the breach not occurred, less any funds Fannie Mae receives from the private mortgage insurer with respect to the applicable Covered Mortgage.  
       
           e. 
    Rebuttals and Repurchase Process  . 
       
           (1) 
    If Fannie Mae requires a repurchase for any MI Rescission Mortgage, Data and Shipping Error Mortgages, IC Fee Reconciliation Mortgage, or a Documented MD/NC Mortgage pursuant to Section 4(b), the Lender who sold such mortgage or the Lender servicing such mortgage shall repurchase or pay the make-whole amount within 30 calendar days after receipt of Fannie Mae's written repurchase request or if such Lender disputes the repurchase request, such Lender shall provide its rebuttal letter and all supporting information within 30 calendar days after receipt of Fannie Mae's written repurchase request. If Fannie Mae determines the original repurchase request should not be rescinded or waived based on its review of such Lender's rebuttal information, such Lender shall repurchase or pay the make-whole amount within 30 calendar days after Fannie Mae's written notification to Lender of its decision regarding the rebuttal. 
       
           (2) 
    Any Repurchase Obligations required to be performed by a Lender pursuant to this Section 4 shall be completed by such Lender's reporting of the applicable repurchase codes through Fannie Mae's reporting system. All make-whole payments made in satisfaction of a Lender's Repurchase Obligations shall be wire transferred to Fannie Mae's account set forth in Section 2(f). 
       
           f. 
    December Repurchase Mortgages.   The December Repurchase Mortgages were taken into account in determining the Credit Amount, even though the loan level accounting data reflecting these repurchases is not yet available to Fannie Mae. To the extent that actual amounts remitted with respect to the December Repurchase Mortgages are less than the amounts that are required to be remitted pursuant to the Selling Guide with respect to such December Repurchase Mortgages, Lender shall immediately pay the difference by wire transfer to Fannie Mae's account set forth in Section 2(f). 
       11 

g. 
    Correction in Investor Reporting Data  . For 18 of the Covered Mortgages listed on   Schedule 8  , the applicable Lender submitted the incorrect investor reporting code. On or before January 4, 2011, Lender shall submit the correct investor reporting code required pursuant to the Servicing Guide to Fannie Mae. 
       
           h. 
    Reservation of Rights  . Except to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement with respect to Covered Mortgages, each Lender and Fannie Mae acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not change the respective contractual rights, obligations, or remedies of such Lender or Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae reserves all of its rights and remedies with respect to all mortgages other than the Covered Mortgages.  
       
           i. 
    No Compromise against Third Parties.   By each Lender's execution hereof, this Agreement does not compromise or release any claim of such Lender against any third party, including but not limited to any insurer, or any correspondent, for any cost or expense hereunder, including attorneys' fees and costs. 
       
           j. 
    Cooperation  . Upon a Lender's request, Fannie Mae will reasonably cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to Lender in exercising any of its rights or remedies available to it against any applicable third party or correspondent from which it may have purchased any of the Covered Mortgage, including providing a confirmation letter stating that there has been a now-resolved claim with respect to a Covered Mortgage, to affirm that a claim for repurchase with respect to a Covered Mortgage has been addressed by this Agreement and/or confirming the liquidation status for any Covered Mortgage, and if liquidated, providing the applicable loss supporting documentation (i.e. loss statement, HUD-1 settlement statement, etc).

    4 

(e) 
    A    Covered Mortgage    means any Mortgage, except to the extent that such Mortgage is reasonably determined by Freddie Mac in accordance with Section 3(f) below to be any of the following: 
       
           (i) 
    a Mortgage secured by a residential property that is not located within any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands at the time of Freddie Mac's purchase, as set forth in Guide Section 22.18 and the definition of a State in the Glossary to the Guide; 
       
           (ii) 
    a Mortgage, the original unpaid principal balance of which at the time of Freddie Mac's purchase exceeded the maximum original loan amounts set forth in Guide Section 23.3; 
       
           (iii) 
    a Mortgage secured by vacant land or property primarily used for agriculture, farming or commercial enterprise at the time of Freddie Mac's purchase; 
       
           (iv) 
    a Mortgage secured by residential properties consisting of five or more dwelling units at the time of Freddie Mac's purchase; 
       
           (v) 
    a Mortgage with an LTV Ratio in excess of 80 percent at the time of Freddie Mac's purchase that (i) did not have mortgage insurance on the portion of the Mortgage in excess of 80 percent of the property's value (determined in accordance with the Guide)  ,   as set forth in Guide Section 27.1, (ii) was not sold with recourse, within the meaning of Section 11.10(a) of the Guide, and (iii) was not sold on a participation basis as described in Guide Section 11.4.1 (provided, however, that Freddie Mac may not require repurchase of a Mortgage under this sub-Section 3(e)(v) based solely on a determination by Freddie Mac that correction of an allegedly incorrect appraisal of the Mortgaged Premises (y) causes the Mortgage to have an LTV Ratio over 80 percent or (z) enlarges any existing excess of the Mortgage's LTV Ratio over 80 percent); 
       
           (vi) 
    a Mortgage that was not a valid First Lien on the Mortgaged Premises at the time of Freddie Mac's purchase; 
       
           (vii)

           (viii) 
    a Mortgage secured by Mortgaged Premises in one of the states listed in Guide Section 22.18 that at the time of origination was designated as a "high-cost," "high-risk" or a similar designation under the applicable state law as referenced in Guide Section 22.18 as ineligible for purchase; 
       
           (ix) 
    any purchase transaction Mortgage secured by a Primary Residence and any Refinance Mortgage that, as described in Guide Section 22.33, had an annual percentage rate or total points and fees that exceed the thresholds under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) and its implementing regulations (the "HOEPA Thresholds") and as a result would have rendered the Mortgage ineligible for purchase by Freddie Mac; in the event that Freddie Mac, in the exercise of its discretion,  
       5 

*Material omitted has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment* 

has a reasonable basis to determine that a Mortgage has an annual percentage rate or total points and fees that exceed the HOEPA Thresholds, but is unable to confirm such noncompliance because necessary information (such as the settlement sheet) is missing from the applicable loan file, then the related Mortgage will be presumed to have an annual percentage rate or total points and fees that exceed the HOEPA Thresholds unless the applicable BofA Seller/Servicer presents credible evidence to the contrary, as determined by Freddie Mac in its reasonable discretion. 
    
           (x) 
    Loan Affected By a Collusive Scheme  : A Mortgage as to which fraud was committed by a borrower or other party to the mortgage transaction in conjunction with such transaction, and as to which all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) the Mortgage was originated as part of a scheme that involved collaboration of at least two perpetrators who need not be employed by the same entity and who participated in the origination process of each of the Mortgages that are part of the scheme or, in the case of a purchase money Mortgage, participated in either the origination process or in the purchase and sale of the Mortgaged Premises, (b) such scheme involved [*__*] or more Mortgages, and (c) the materially false representation or warranty made by the borrower or other party had an adverse and material impact on (A) the value of the Mortgage, (B) its saleabilty in the secondary mortgage market, (C) the borrower's ability to perform under the Mortgage, or (D) the collectibility of regular payments under the Mortgage. 
       
  For purposes of this sub-Section 3(e)(x), participation in the origination process or in the purchase and sale of the Mortgaged Premises includes, but is not limited to, participation as borrower, mortgage broker, real estate broker, appraiser, settlement agent, escrow holder or title insurer. 
    
           (xi) 
    Recourse Loan  . A Mortgage listed on Exhibit C. 
       
           (f) 
    Freddie Mac shall provide the relevant BofA Seller/Servicer with thirty (30) days notice of its determination that any Mortgage falls within any of the Covered Mortgage exceptions above and shall accompany such notice with sufficient documentation to enable that BofA Seller/Servicer to determine the validity of Freddie Mac's assertion. The BofA Seller/Servicers retain the right to appeal in good faith and in a timely manner Freddie Mac's determination that any Mortgage falls within these exceptions; any such appeal shall include a written explanation of why such determination is incorrect, plus reasonable evidence in writing supporting such explanation. Each BofA Seller/Servicer must comply with Guide Section 72.6 when making any such appeals. 
       
           (g) 
    Notwithstanding sub-Sections 3(a) - (f) above, the Released Obligations and Claims do not include any obligations of any BofA Seller/Servicer under the Guide provisions set forth in Exhibit D, to the extent set forth in Exhibit D. However, it shall not be a breach of Guide Section 27.2 (Item 7 in Exhibit D) for a BofA Seller/Servicer to receive consideration for or otherwise benefit from the placement or renewal of any mortgage insurance with a mortgage insurance company or mortgage reinsurance company that is an Affiliate of the BofA Seller/Servicer under an arrangement previously  
       6 

approved by Freddie Mac. In the event of a breach of any of the Guide provisions set forth in Exhibit D by a BofA Seller/Servicer, Freddie Mac shall retain all of the remedies to which it is entitled under the Guide and the other Purchase Documents (including but not limited to the right to terminate the eligibility of the BofA Seller/Servicer to sell and/or service mortgages to or for Freddie Mac) except that such a breach shall not entitle Freddie Mac to require repurchase of or indemnification with respect to any Mortgage or entitle Freddie Mac to exercise any other remedy with respect to specific Mortgages. 
    
           (h) 
    Freddie Mac represents and warrants that it will act in good faith in executing any rights and obligations Freddie Mac has pursuant to this Agreement, including in its determinations regarding whether any Mortgage is subject to the above exceptions. 
       
           (i) 
    Freddie Mac acknowledges that the representations and warranties relating to the eligibility of Mortgages for sale to Freddie Mac, including but not limited to representations and warranties in volume 1 of the Guide relating to the underwriting, origination, sale, and delivery of Mortgages to Freddie Mac and/or in any other applicable Purchase Documents, are those in effect on the date each Mortgage was purchased by Freddie Mac. Any changes made by Freddie Mac to these representations and warranties (in the Guide or otherwise) subsequent to the date of sale of a particular Mortgage to Freddie Mac do not apply to such Mortgage. 
       
  4.        Contesting Rescissions of Mortgage Insurance  . 
    
           (a) 
    Each of the BofA Seller/Servicers, but solely to the extent that the BofA Seller/Servicer has an obligation to service a Covered Mortgage, covenants that: 
       
           (i) 
    it will service each Covered Mortgage in accordance with the terms of the Guide; 
       
           (ii) 
    it will in good faith contest on Freddie Mac's behalf any action by a private mortgage insurer which action would result in the rescission, denial or unavailability of mortgage insurance with respect to a Covered Mortgage (irrespective of whether there has been a breach by a BofA Seller/Servicer or any of its predecessors or Affiliates of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement related to such Mortgage); 
       
           (iii) 
    the level of effort undertaken by the responsible BofA Seller/Servicer in connection with the above will be no less than the efforts generally taken in the ordinary course by the BofA Seller/Servicer in contesting the rescission, denial or unavailability of mortgage insurance in connection with mortgage loans held or serviced for its own account or for any of its Affiliates; 
       
           (iv) 
    upon the request of either Freddie Mac or a private mortgage insurer, it will provide copies of the specified Mortgage files or documents to the applicable private mortgage insurer in connection with the rescission or denial of a mortgage insurance policy; and 
       
    7 

*Material omitted has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment* 

(v) 
    it will notify Freddie Mac periodically in writing when it is unable to successfully contest the rescission, denial or unavailability of mortgage insurance in connection with one or more Covered Mortgages, and unless as may subsequently be agreed to by Freddie Mac and the responsible BofA Seller/Servicer, will not accept rescission or otherwise settle the dispute without Freddie Mac's prior written consent, which Freddie Mac will not unreasonably delay or withhold. 
       
           (b) 
    In no event shall any of the covenants set forth in this Section 4 be deemed a [*_____________________________*] of any BofA Seller/Servicer or any of its Affiliates, nor shall the [*___________________________________________*] under any Purchase Document. [*_______________________________________________*.] 
       
           (c) 
    Upon the rescission of any mortgage insurance policy covering any Covered Mortgage, if any mortgage insurance premiums are refunded by the private mortgage insurer directly to a BofA Seller/Servicer upon the rescission of such policy, that BofA Seller/Servicer will promptly direct or remit such funds to Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac shall assume any and all risk that its rights, or the right of any BofA Seller/Servicer, have been prejudiced or compromised in any way by virtue of Freddie Mac's acceptance of such funds or its treatment of the remittance. 
       
  5  .      Servicing of Mortgages  . 
    
           (a) 
    Each BofA Seller/Servicer shall continue to service the Mortgages for which it is the Servicer in accordance with the applicable Purchase Documents following the Closing Date. In the event of an alleged breach by a BofA Seller/Servicer of its respective Servicing Obligations (as defined herein) with respect to any Mortgage, Freddie Mac retains such rights as it may have to pursue that BofA Seller/Servicer for such breach under the Purchase Documents. 
       
           (b) 
    This Agreement does not release any BofA Seller/Servicer or any of its Affiliates from any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements relating to the performance of Servicing Obligations.  Servicing Obligations  means obligations and duties that arise under Volume 2 of the Guide and related provisions of the Purchase Documents, including but not limited to requirements relating to day-to-day loan administration activities, reporting and remitting, and foreclosure and loss mitigation activities. Servicing Obligations as defined herein relate to activities required to be performed in connection with the servicing of the Mortgage after the date of Freddie Mac's purchase. It is possible for a Servicing Obligation to relate to the same general subject matter as a Released Obligation and Claim, if a failure to comply with a selling obligation occurred on or before the purchase date, followed later by a failure after the purchase date to perform a required Servicing Obligation relating to the same general subject matter. A BofA Seller/Servicer may be deemed to have violated a Servicing Obligation only if the action or lack of action that Freddie Mac asserts constitutes the violation occurred after the purchase date. 
       
  Any rescission of a mortgage insurance policy shall be deemed to be an event taking place on the date that the applicable BofA Servicer receives notice of such rescission, and shall not be treated as an absence of mortgage insurance as of the date of Freddie Mac's purchase of the affected Mortgage. 
    8 

*Material omitted has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment* 

Example One  : If a Mortgage failed to satisfy Guide requirements for hazard insurance as of the date of purchase of such Mortgage by Freddie Mac, the action would be treated as a failure to comply with a selling obligation and the applicable BofA Seller/Servicer would be released under this Agreement from liability for representations and warranties regarding such failure. If, however, such Mortgage was subsequently serviced by a BofA Seller/Servicer, and the BofA Seller/Servicer failed to cause insurance to be obtained in accordance with Guide servicing requirements, the failure of such Mortgage to have hazard insurance in compliance with Guide requirements would be a breach of a Servicing Obligation, from which the BofA Seller/Servicer would not be released under this Agreement. 
    
  Example Two  : If a Mortgage with an LTV ratio exceeding 80 percent lacked the required credit enhancement (mortgage insurance, recourse or as a participation) on the date the Mortgage was sold to Freddie Mac, the Mortgage would not be a Covered Mortgage. 
    
  Example Three  : A Mortgage with an LTV ratio exceeding 80 percent was sold to Freddie Mac with the mortgage insurance required by the Guide. The private mortgage insurer rescinds the mortgage insurance policy three years after date of sale to Freddie Mac, because it determines the Mortgage is secured by a commercial property. This Mortgage would not be a Covered Mortgage. 
    
  Example Four  : A Mortgage with an LTV ratio exceeding 80 percent was sold to Freddie Mac with the mortgage insurance required by the Guide. The private mortgage insurer rescinds the mortgage insurance policy because the credit characteristics of the Mortgage do not comply with the standards set by the mortgage insurer. [*_______________________________________*.]  
    
           (c) 
    Although this Agreement provides for the Released Parties to be released from liability for the Released Obligations and Claims, each relevant BofA Seller/Servicer must continue to service the Mortgages for which it is the Servicer in accordance with the Purchase Documents and make all efforts as required under the Purchase Documents to mitigate losses relating to such Mortgages. If any BofA Seller/Servicer does not service the Mortgages for which it is the Servicer in accordance with the Purchase Documents, Freddie Mac may, in its sole discretion, exercise any and all of its available remedies under the Purchase Documents relative to the entity that is the servicer for such Mortgages. 
              (d) 
    (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Guide regarding the unitary and indivisible nature of the servicing contract, Freddie Mac may exercise its right under Guide Chapter 73 to terminate or transfer servicing of any portion of the Mortgages as to each of which a BofA Seller/Servicer has materially failed to comply with any of the servicing requirements contained in the Purchase Documents, provided that such Mortgages are 30 days or more delinquent at the time of the written notice contemplated under (B) below and are at least 60 days delinquent at the date of termination or transfer, if:  
              (A) 
    Such failure would entitle Freddie Mac to terminate the entire servicing contract as to the BofA Seller/Servicer; 
       
           (B) 
    Freddie Mac gives the BofA Seller/Servicer written notice identifying the Affected Mortgages (as defined below) and the failure to comply with servicing requirements;  
       
    9 

(C) 
    the BofA Seller/Servicer fails to cure such non-compliance within 60 days after the notice in (B) above; and 
       
           (D) 
    On the effective date of the transfer or termination, Freddie Mac executes and delivers to the affected BofA Seller/Servicer a release of all claims, counterclaims, defenses, rights of setoff, debt, liens, Losses, demands, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs actually incurred) and causes of action of any kind or nature whatsoever, as to or against the affected BofA Seller/Servicer, arising out of, or in connection with, the servicing of the Mortgages as to which servicing has been transferred or terminated (the "Affected Mortgages"), whether asserted, unasserted, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, fixed or contingent, in contract or tort, unsecured, secured, priority, administrative or otherwise, that Freddie Mac may then or may thereafter have against the affected BofA Seller/Servicer, under any provision of the Guide or any Purchase Documents or the laws, regulations or administrative or executive directives of the United States or any other jurisdiction, including but not limited to, any repurchase or indemnification obligation or other remedy contained in any of the Purchase Documents with respect to a breach of the terms thereof or any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or requirement made or contained therein (irrespective of how characterized) except that the foregoing release shall not release, apply to or affect any of the following:
