Mississippi Power  was incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on July 12, 1972,
was admitted to do business in Alabama on November 28, 1972, and effective December 21, 1972, by
the merger into it of the predecessor Mississippi Power Company, succeeded to the business and
properties of the latter company. The predecessor Mississippi Power Company was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Maine on November 24, 1924 and was admitted to do business in
Mississippi on December 23, 1924 and in Alabama on December 7, 1962.

In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of Southern Power, which is also an

Southern Company also owns all of the outstanding common stock or membership interests of
SouthernLINC Wireless, Southern Nuclear, SCS, Southern Holdings, Southern Renewable Energy, and
other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless
communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and markets these services
to the public and also provides wholesale fiber optic solutions to telecommunication providers in
the Southeast. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Alabama Power s and Georgia
Power s nuclear plants and is currently developing new nuclear generation at Plant Vogtle. SCS is
the system service company providing, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its
subsidiary companies. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern

The Southern Company System 

Traditional Operating Companies 

The traditional operating companies own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See
PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional operating companies 
generating facilities. Each company s transmission facilities are connected to the respective
company s own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by
Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional
operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia s integrated transmission
system, see  Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power  herein.

Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy
transactions that may be entered into from time to time for reasons related to reliability or
economics. Additionally, the traditional operating companies have entered into voluntary
reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric Power
Coordinating Group, and TVA and with Progress Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy, South Carolina
Electric   Gas Company, and Virginia Electric and Power Company, each of which provides for the
establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of
generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency
operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional
operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast (including some of those
referred to above) to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power
supply. Through the SERC, the traditional operating companies are represented on the National
Electric Reliability Council.

The utility assets of the traditional operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power are operated as a single
integrated electric system, or power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are
administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional operating companies and Southern
Power. The fundamental purpose of the power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the
electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the
highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating
limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized
economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional operating company and Southern Power retains
its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess
energy to the power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional operating companies or
Southern Power or for sale by the power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery
of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the
proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from power pool transactions with third
parties.

Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern Power, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO, and
other subsidiaries have contracted with SCS to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon
request, the following services: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
transactions. Southern Power and SouthernLINC Wireless have also secured from the traditional
operating companies certain services which are furnished at cost and, in the case of Southern Power
which is subject to FERC regulations, in compliance with such regulations.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have a contract with Southern Nuclear to operate Plant Farley

Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. In addition, Georgia Power has a contract with Southern Nuclear to
develop, construct, license, and operate additional generating units at Plant Vogtle. See
 Regulation   Nuclear Regulation  herein for additional information.

Southern Power 

Southern Power is an electric wholesale generation subsidiary with market-based rate authority from
the FERC. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells
electricity at market-based prices in the wholesale market. Southern Power s business activities
are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional operating companies but are
subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from
significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by making such risks
the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power s future earnings
will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market, federal regulation, and the efficient
operation of its wholesale generating assets. For additional information on Southern Power s
business activities, see MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OVERVIEW    Business Activities  of
Southern Power in Item 7 herein.

In June 2008, Southern Power completed construction on Plant Franklin Unit 3 which added 659
megawatts to the Southern Company system generating capacity. In December 2008, Southern Power
announced plans to construct a 720 megawatt electric generating plant in North Carolina. This new
plant is expected to go into commercial operation in 2012.

On October 8, 2009, Southern Power acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of
Nacogdoches Power LLC from American Renewables LLC, the original developer of the project.
Nacogdoches Power LLC is constructing a biomass generating plant in Sacul, Texas with an estimated
capacity of 100 megawatts. The generating plant will be fueled from wood waste. Construction
began in late 2009 and the plant is expected to begin commercial operation in 2012. The total
estimated cost of the project is expected to be between $475 million and $500 million. The output
of the plant is contracted under a PPA with Austin Energy that begins in 2012 and expires in 2032.

On December 17, 2009, Southern Power acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of West
Georgia Generating Company, LLC (West Georgia) from Broadway Gen Funding, LLC, an affiliate of LS
Power. West Georgia was merged into Southern Power as of the acquisition date and Southern Power
now owns a dual-fueled generating plant near Thomaston, Georgia with nameplate capacity of
approximately 669 megawatts. The plant consists of four combustion turbine natural gas generating
units with oil back-up. The output from two units is contracted under PPAs with MEAG Power and
the Georgia Energy Cooperative (GEC). The MEAG Power PPA began in 2009 and expires in 2029. The
GEC PPA begins in 2010 and expires in 2030.

As of December 31, 2009, Southern Power had 7,880 megawatts of nameplate capacity in commercial
operation.

Construction Programs 

The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs
to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. For estimated
construction and environmental expenditures for the periods 2010 through 2012, see Note 7 to the
financial statements of Southern Company and each traditional operating company under  Construction
Program  and Note 7 to the financial statements of Southern Power under  Expansion Program  in Item
8 herein. Estimated construction costs in 2010 are expected to be apportioned approximately as
follows: (in millions)

* 
       
     These amounts include the traditional operating companies and Southern Power (as detailed in the
table above) as well as the amounts for the other subsidiaries. See  Other Businesses  herein for
additional information. 

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and
regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no
assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Under Georgia law, Georgia Power is required to file an IRP for approval by the Georgia PSC.
Through the IRP process, the Georgia PSC must pre-certify the construction of new power plants and
new PPAs. See  Rate Matters   Integrated Resource Planning  herein for additional information.

Fuel Supply 

The traditional operating companies  and SEGCO s supply of electricity is derived
predominantly from coal. Southern Power s supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural
gas. See MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   RESULTS OF OPERATION    Fuel and Purchased Power
Expenses  of Southern Company and each traditional operating company in Item 7 herein for
information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net
kilowatt-hour generated for the years 2007 through 2009.

Table of Contents   

The traditional operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive
approximately 98% of their coal burn requirements in 2010. These agreements have terms ranging
between one and eight years. In 2009, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by
the traditional operating companies was 74% sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked and
purchased sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the traditional operating companies to remain within
limits set by the Phase II acid rain requirements of the Clean Air Act. In 2009, the Southern
Company system purchased approximately $18.3 million of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions
allowances to be used in current and future periods. As additional environmental regulations are
proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional operating companies  fuel mix will be
monitored to ensure that the traditional operating companies remain in compliance with applicable
laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional operating companies will
continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances and the timing of capital
expenditures for emissions control equipment. See MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Environmental Matters  of Southern Company and each traditional operating
company in Item 7 herein for information on the Clean Air Act and global climate issues.

SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, has agreements in
place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2010, SCS has
contracted for 207.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms
up to 11 years. In addition to gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm gas
transportation and storage. Management believes that these contracts provide sufficient natural
gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company
system s natural gas generating units.

Changes in fuel prices to the traditional operating companies are generally reflected in fuel
adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See  Rate Matters   Rate Structure and Cost
Recovery Plans  herein for additional information. Southern Power s PPAs generally provide that
the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have numerous contracts covering a portion of their nuclear fuel
needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication. These contracts
have varying expiration dates and most of them are for less than 10 years. Management believes
that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to preclude the impairment
of normal operations of the Southern Company system s nuclear generating units.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that
provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of
spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are pursuing
legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial
statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power under  Nuclear Fuel Disposal
Costs  in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power 

The territory in which the traditional operating companies provide electric service comprises
most of the states of Alabama and Georgia together with the northwestern portion of Florida and
southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems
which obtain some or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the
traditional operating companies. The territory has an area of approximately 120,000 square miles
and an estimated population of approximately 13 million. Southern Power sells electricity at
market-based prices in the wholesale market to investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and
electric cooperatives.

Alabama Power is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the generation and purchase of
electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity at retail in over 650
communities (including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa), as well
as in rural areas, and at wholesale to 15 municipally-owned electric distribution systems, 11 of
which are served indirectly through sales to AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative
associations. Alabama Power owns coal reserves near its Plant Gorgas and uses the output of coal
from the reserves in its generating plants. Alabama Power also sells, and cooperates with dealers
in promoting the sale of, electric appliances.

distribution, and sale of such electricity within 23 counties in southeastern Mississippi, at
retail in 123 communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport, Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian, and
Pascagoula), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric
distribution cooperative associations, and one generating and transmitting cooperative.

For information relating to kilowatt-hour sales by customer classification for the traditional
operating companies, see MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of each
traditional operating company in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating to the sources of
revenues for Southern Company, each traditional operating company, and Southern Power, reference is
made to Item 7 herein.

The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations or corporations to enable them to
provide electric service to customers in rural sections of the country. There are 71 electric
cooperative organizations operating in the territory in which the traditional operating companies
provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

One of these organizations, PowerSouth, is a generating and transmitting cooperative selling power
to several distributing cooperatives, municipal systems, and other customers in south Alabama and
northwest Florida. PowerSouth owns generating units with approximately 1,776 megawatts of
nameplate capacity, including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power s Plant Miller
Units 1 and 2. PowerSouth s facilities were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts
requiring distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from PowerSouth to the extent such
energy is available.

Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate agreements with PowerSouth involving
interconnection between their respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from
PowerSouth to certain distributing cooperatives in the service areas of Alabama Power and Gulf
Power is governed by the Southern Company/PowerSouth Network Transmission Service Agreement. The
rates for this service to PowerSouth are on file with the FERC. See PROPERTIES    Jointly-Owned
Facilities  in Item 2 herein for details of Alabama Power s joint-ownership with PowerSouth of a
portion of Plant Miller.

Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within Gulf Power s service
area. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from PowerSouth and SEPA (a federal
power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also operates within Gulf Power s service area
and purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power.

Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a generating and transmitting
cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided, including the furnishing of
protective capacity by Mississippi Power to SMEPA.

There are also 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in
which the traditional operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

Forty-eight municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system receive
their requirements through MEAG Power, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975.
MEAG Power serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are
acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, power purchased from Georgia Power, and purchases
from other resources. MEAG Power also has a pseudo

I-6 

Table of Contents   

scheduling and services agreement with Georgia Power. Dalton serves its requirements from
self-owned generation facilities, some of which are acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power,
and through purchases from Georgia Power and Southern Power through a service agreement. In
addition, Georgia Power serves the full requirements of Hampton s electric distribution system
under a market-based contract. See PROPERTIES    Jointly-Owned Facilities  in Item 2 herein for
additional information.

Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia Transmission
Corporation (formerly OPC s transmission division), MEAG Power, and Dalton providing for the
establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of all parties.
The agreements require an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in
proportion to its respective share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES    Jointly-Owned
Facilities  in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Southern
Power has PPAs with some of the traditional operating companies and with other investor-owned
utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and electric cooperatives. See MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Power Sales Agreements  of Southern Power in Item 7 herein
for additional information concerning Southern Power s PPAs.

SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies, also has a contract with SEPA
providing for the use of the traditional operating companies  facilities at government expense to
deliver to certain cooperatives and municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in
the purchase of power from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power allocated
to them by SEPA from certain United States government hydroelectric projects.

The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the
Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas within
existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein. Areas outside of
such municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of
supplier by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with
such standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a
supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating
outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 kilowatts may exercise
a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its
choice. See  Competition  herein for additional information.

Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued  Grandfather Certificates  of public
convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating
in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them
to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The
six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of
approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a  Grandfather Certificate,  the utility
holding such certificate may, without further certification, extend its lines up to five miles;
other extensions within that area by such utility, or by other utilities, may not be made except
upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas
included in such a certificate which are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be
served by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing
municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into
such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.

Competition 

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a result of
regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Act of
1992 which allowed IPPs to access a utility s transmission network in order to sell electricity to
other utilities.

The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by
various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and
reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory,
political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.

Generally, the traditional operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to
experience, competition

I-7 

Table of Contents   

in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees as the result of self-generation
(as described below) by customers and other factors. See also  Territory Served by the Traditional
Operating Companies and Southern Power  herein for additional information concerning suppliers of
electricity operating within or near the areas served at retail by the traditional operating
companies.

Southern Power competes with investor owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales
primarily in the Southeastern United States wholesale market. The needs of this market are driven
by the demands of end users in the Southeast and the generation available. Southern Power s
success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and
availability of Southern Power s plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price,
and Southern Power s ability to contain costs.

Alabama Power currently has cogeneration contracts in effect with 11 industrial customers. Under
the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess generation of such companies. During
2009, Alabama Power purchased approximately 232 million kilowatt-hours from such companies at a
cost of $16.5 million.

Georgia Power currently has contracts in effect with nine small power producers whereby Georgia
Power purchases their excess generation. During 2009, Georgia Power purchased 14.7 million
kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $0.6 million. Georgia Power has PPAs for
electricity with two cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to
meet minimum capacity output. During 2009, Georgia Power purchased
42.3 million kilowatt-hours at a cost of $19.7 million from these facilities.

Also during 2009, Georgia Power purchased energy from eight customer-owned generating facilities.
Seven of the eight customers provide only energy to Georgia Power. These seven customers make no
capacity commitment and are not dispatched by Georgia Power. Georgia Power does have a contract
with the remaining customer for eight megawatts of dispatchable capacity and energy. During 2009,
Georgia Power purchased a total of 56.3 million kilowatt-hours from the eight customers at a cost
of approximately $1.9 million.

Gulf Power currently has agreements in effect with various industrial, commercial, and qualifying
facilities pursuant to which Gulf Power purchases  as available  energy from customer-owned
generation. During 2009, Gulf Power purchased 76 million kilowatt-hours from such companies for
approximately $4.3 million.

Mississippi Power currently has a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial
customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation.
During 2009, Mississippi Power did not purchase any excess generation from this customer.

Seasonality 

The demand for electric power generation is affected by seasonal differences in the weather.
At the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, the demand for power peaks during the
summer months, with market prices reflecting the demand of power and available generating resources
at that time. Power demand peaks can also be recorded during the winter. As a result, the overall
operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in
the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the
traditional operating companies, and Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather
conditions are milder.

Regulation 

State Commissions 

The traditional operating companies are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs.
The PSCs have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the
respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the
Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail
service territories. See  Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern
Power  and  Rate Matters  herein for additional information.

I-8 

Table of Contents   

Federal Power Act 

The traditional operating companies, Southern Power and its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are
all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and therefore are
subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power
Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an  at cost standard  for services
rendered by system service companies such as SCS. The FERC is also authorized to establish
regional reliability organizations which are authorized to enforce reliability standards, to
address impediments to the construction of transmission, and to prohibit manipulative energy
trading practices.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the
earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric
developments. Among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing
Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,662,400 kilowatts and
18 existing Georgia Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,087,296
kilowatts.

In May 2008, the FERC issued a new 30-year license for the Morgan Falls project, located on the
Chattahoochee River near Atlanta, with an effective start date of March 1, 2009. In 2007, Georgia
Power began the relicensing process for Bartlett s Ferry which is located on the Chattahoochee
River near Columbus, Georgia. The current Bartlett s Ferry license expires in 2014 and the
application for a new license is expected to be submitted to the FERC in 2012. In July 2005,
Alabama Power filed two applications with the FERC for new 50-year licenses for its seven
hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan,
and Bouldin) and for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead developments on the Warrior River. The FERC
licenses for all of these nine developments expired in July and August 2007. The FERC issued an
annual license for the Coosa developments in August 2007 and issued an annual license for the
Warrior developments in September 2007. Both of these licenses were automatically renewed in 2008
and 2009 pursuant to FERC regulations. These annual licenses provide the FERC with additional time
to complete its review of the license applications. In 2006, Alabama Power initiated the process
of developing an application to relicense the Martin hydroelectric project located on the
Tallapoosa River. The current Martin license will expire in 2013 and the application for a new
license is expected to be filed with the FERC in 2011. In 2010, Alabama Power plans to initiate the
process of developing an application to relicense the Holt hydroelectric project located on Warrior
River. The current Holt license will expire in August 2015 and the application for a new license
is expected to be filed prior to that time. See MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL    FERC Matters  of Alabama Power in Item 7 herein for
additional information.

Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain Plant, a pure
pumped storage facility of 847,800 kilowatt capacity. See PROPERTIES    Jointly-Owned Facilities 
in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the period 2023-2034 in the
case of Alabama Power s projects and in the period 2014-2039 in the case of Georgia Power s
projects.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States Government, by act of Congress, may
take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a
new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be
compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to
reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the
property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance
therefrom of the property. If the FERC does not act on the new license application prior to the
expiration of the existing license, the FERC is required to issue annual licenses, under the same
terms and conditions of the existing license, until a new license is issued.

Nuclear Regulation 

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC
is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting
research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Act of 1978; and in accordance with the

I-9 

Table of Contents   

National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These
responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment,
protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national
security, and assuring conformity with antitrust laws.

In January 2002, the NRC granted Georgia Power a 20-year extension of the licenses for both units
at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038, respectively. In
May 2005, the NRC granted Alabama Power a 20-year extension of the licenses for both units at Plant
Farley which permits operation of units 1 and 2 until 2037 and 2041, respectively. On June 3,
2009, the NRC approved 20-year extensions of the licenses for the operation of Plant Vogtle Units 1
and 2 to 2047 and 2049, respectively.

On August 26, 2009, the NRC issued an Early Site Permit and Limited Work Authorization to Southern
Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power, OPC, MEAG Power, and Dalton (collectively, Owners), related to
two additional nuclear units on the site of Plant Vogtle (Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4). In March
2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a combined construction and operating
license for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which, if licensed by the NRC, are scheduled to be placed
in service in 2016 and 2017, respectively. See MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE

in Item 8 herein for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations 

Southern Company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal
environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media,
including air, water, and land resources. Compliance with these existing environmental
requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected
to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions or market-based rates for Southern Power. There is no assurance, however, that all
such costs will be recovered.

Compliance with the federal Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been, and will continue to
be, a significant focus for Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern Power,
and SEGCO. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations may be changed or new laws and
regulations may be adopted or otherwise become applicable to Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, Southern Power, or SEGCO, including laws and regulations designed to address
global climate change, air quality, water quality, management of waste materials and coal
combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental, public health, and welfare
concerns. See MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Environmental
Matters  of Southern Company and each of the traditional operating companies in Item 7 herein for
additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, including, but not
limited to, the litigation brought by the EPA under the New Source Review provisions of the Clean
Air Act, possible additional and/or revised regulations related to air and water quality, possible
climate change legislation and regulation, and possible regulation of coal combustion byproducts.
Also see MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Environmental Matters 
of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for information about the environmental issues and possible
climate change legislation and regulation.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO are unable to
predict at this time what additional steps they may be required to take as a result of the
implementation of existing or future requirements pertaining to climate change, air quality, water
quality, and management of waste materials and coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash, but
such steps could adversely affect system operations and result in substantial additional costs.

The outcome of the matters mentioned above under  Regulation  cannot now be determined, except that
these developments may affect unit retirement and replacement decisions and may result in delays in
obtaining appropriate licenses for generating facilities, increased construction and operating
costs, or reduced generation, the nature and extent of which, while not determinable at this time,
could be substantial.

Rate Matters 

Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans 

The rates and service regulations of the traditional operating companies are uniform for each class
of service throughout their respective service areas. Rates for residential electric service are
generally of the block type based upon kilowatt-hours used and include minimum charges.
Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are
presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to
determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers  rates are generally based upon
usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage.
Additionally, Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their
respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms
and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval.

Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions at
the traditional operating companies. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect
increases or decreases in such costs as needed. Gulf Power s and Mississippi Power s fuel cost
recovery provisions are adjusted annually to reflect increases or decreases in such costs. Georgia
Power filed for an adjustment to its fuel cost recovery rate on December 15, 2009. If approved by
the Georgia PSC, the adjustment would be effective on April 1, 2010. Alabama Power s fuel clause
is adjusted as required. Revenues are adjusted for differences between recoverable costs and
amounts actually recovered in current rates.

Approved environmental compliance and storm damage costs are recovered at Alabama Power and
Mississippi Power through cost recovery provisions approved by their respective state PSCs. Within
limits approved by their respective PSCs, these rates are adjusted to reflect increases or
decreases in such costs as required.

Georgia Power s environmental compliance costs are recovered in base rates. Under the 2007 retail
rate plan, an environmental compliance cost recovery tariff was implemented effective January 1,
2008 to allow recovery of environmental costs mandated by state and federal regulation. See Note
3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power
  Retail Rate Plans  and Georgia Power under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate Plans  in Item 8
herein for additional information.

Nuclear Financing Act and the Georgia PSC certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which allow
Georgia Power to recover financing costs for construction of the new nuclear units during the
construction period beginning in 2011.

Alabama Power recovers the cost of certificated new plant and purchased power capacity through cost
recovery provisions which are approved annually. Gulf Power files a rate clause request annually
with the Florida PSC to recover costs associated with purchased power capacity, energy
conservation, and environmental compliance. Revenues are adjusted for differences between
recoverable costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are authorized by the FERC to sell power to
non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC
approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

Integrated Resource Planning 

Georgia Power  

Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to
meet the future electrical needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and
supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or
supply-side resources for Georgia Power to get cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual
or certified construction costs and purchased power costs will be recoverable through rates.

On August 31, 2009, Georgia Power filed with the Georgia PSC its first semi-annual construction
monitoring report for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for the period ended June 30, 2009, which did not
include any proposed change to the estimated construction cost as certified by the Georgia PSC in
March 2009. On February 25, 2010, the Georgia PSC approved the expenditures made by Georgia Power
pursuant to the certification through June 30, 2009. The Georgia PSC also ordered that in its
future semi-annual construction monitoring reports, Georgia Power will report against a total
certified cost of approximately $6.1 billion, which is the effective certified amount after giving
effect to the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act. Georgia Power will continue to file
construction monitoring reports by February 28 and August 31 of each year during the construction
period.

In connection with its approval of the updated IRP on March 17, 2009, the Georgia PSC also approved
Georgia Power s plan for the installation of emissions controls at its Plant Branch Units 1   4 and
Plant Yates Units 6 and 7. However, Georgia Power has suspended further engineering and
construction activity on the emissions control projects at Plant Branch Units 1 and 2 and Plant
Yates Units 6 and 7 until more information is available from the rulemaking and legislative
process, thereby mitigating the risk related to significant capital expenditures associated with
those projects. Georgia Power continues to review the economic feasibility of installing controls
at Plant Branch Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power intends to continue to operate these units in the
near term and reevaluate the economics of installing emissions controls on these units as more
information becomes available.

Georgia Power plans to convert the 155-megawatt coal-fired Plant Mitchell Unit 3 to a renewable
biomass facility fueled primarily with wood chips. Georgia Power filed a request for approval of
the certification of the Plant Mitchell biomass conversion with the Georgia PSC in August 2008. On
March 17, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power s request for certification of the Plant
Mitchell biomass conversion. Georgia Power filed an air permit application for the conversion with
the Georgia Environmental Protection Division in December 2008. Georgia Power expects to be granted
an air permit in 15 to 18 months from the filing date. With the uncertainty of how future EPA
regulations might affect allowable industrial boiler emissions, Georgia Power has decided to delay
the conversion of Plant Mitchell Unit 3 to biomass until the EPA rules are better defined, which is
expected in April 2010. Georgia Power had originally planned to begin retrofit construction at
Plant Mitchell in April 2011 with the unit becoming operational in June 2012. A new project
schedule has yet to be determined.

On January 29, 2010, Georgia Power filed its 2010 IRP for approval by the Georgia PSC. The 2010
IRP projected that Georgia Power s current supply-side and demand-side resources are sufficient to
provide a cost effective and reliable source of capacity and energy at least through 2014. The
2010 IRP identifies potential regulations relating to coal combustion byproducts and maximum
achievable control technology for hazardous air pollutants, as well as potential legislation or
regulations that would impose mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. See MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Environmental Matters   Environmental
Statutes and Regulations   Air Quality,   Environmental Matters   Environmental Statutes and
Regulations   Coal Combustion Byproducts,  and  Environmental Matters   Global Climate Issues  of
Georgia Power in Item 7 herein. While neither proposed nor final EPA regulations have been
released at this time with respect to hazardous air pollutants or coal combustion byproducts,
Georgia Power currently estimates that compliance would be required by about January 2015. The
2010 IRP includes preliminary retirement studies under a variety of potential scenarios for units
at seven of Georgia Power s coal-fired generating plants. These studies indicated that, depending
on the final requirements in both of these anticipated EPA regulations and any legislation or
regulation relating to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as estimates of long-term fuel prices, Georgia
Power may conclude that it is more economical to retire certain coal-fired generating units than to
install the required controls and/or that Georgia Power may not be able to complete installation of
required controls on all such units by 2015 where such installation is determined to be more
economical. Given the uncertainty and the amount of capacity at

I-12 

Table of Contents   

risk of retirement, Georgia Power has restarted its 2015 RFP for 1,000 megawatts of capacity and
energy. However, Georgia Power s capacity needs could change significantly depending on the final
requirements resulting from these environmental regulations.

The Georgia PSC certified the construction of Plant McDonough Units 4, 5, and 6 (natural gas-fired
units) and the retirement of Plant McDonough Units 1 and 2 (coal-fired units) in 2007. On August
10, 2009, Georgia Power filed its quarterly construction monitoring report for Plant McDonough
Units 4, 5, and 6 for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. On September 30, 2009, Georgia Power
amended the report. As amended, the report includes a request for an increase in the certified
costs to construct Plant McDonough. The Georgia PSC held a hearing in December 2009 and is
scheduled to render its decision on March 16, 2010.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power in Item 8 herein for
additional information regarding the proposed Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Gulf Power  

Annually by April 1, Gulf Power must file a 10-year site plan with the Florida PSC containing Gulf
Power s estimate of its power-generating needs in the period and the general location of its
proposed power plant sites. The 10-year site plans submitted by the state s electric utilities are
reviewed by the Florida PSC and subsequently classified as either  suitable  or  unsuitable.  The
Florida PSC then reports its findings along with any suggested revisions to the Florida Department
of Environmental Protection for its consideration at any subsequent electrical power plant site
certification proceedings. Under Florida law, any 10-year site plans submitted by an electric
utility are considered tentative information for planning purposes only and may be amended at any
time at the discretion of the utility with written notification to the Florida PSC. At least every
five years, the Florida PSC must conduct proceedings to establish numerical goals for all
investor-owned electric utilities and certain municipal or cooperative electric utilities in the
state to reduce the growth rates of weather-sensitive peak demand, to reduce and control the growth
rates of electric consumption, and to increase the conservation of expensive resources, such as
petroleum fuels. Overall residential kilowatts and kilowatt hours goals and overall
commercial/industrial kilowatt and kilowatt hours goals for each utility are set by the Florida PSC
for each year over a 10-year period. The goals are to be based on an estimate of the total cost
effective kilowatts and kilowatt hours savings reasonably achievable through demand-side management
in each utility s service area over a 10-year period. Once goals have been set, each affected
utility must develop and submit plans and programs to meet the overall goals within its service
area to the Florida PSC for review and approval. Once approved, the utilities are required to
submit periodic reports which the Florida PSC then uses to prepare its annual report to the
Governor and Legislature of the goals that have been established and the progress towards meeting
those goals.

Gulf Power s most recent 10-year site plan was classified by the Florida PSC as  suitable  in
December 2009. Gulf Power s most recent 10-year site plan and environmental compliance plan
identify potential environmental regulations relating to maximum achievable control technology for
hazardous air pollutants and potential legislation or regulation that would impose mandatory
restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. See MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Environmental Matters   Environmental Statutes and Regulations   Air
Quality,   Environmental Matters   Environmental Statutes and Regulations   Coal Combustion
Byproducts,  and  Environmental Matters   Global Climate Issues  of Gulf Power in Item 7 herein.
The site plan and environmental compliance plan include preliminary retirement studies under a
variety of potential scenarios for units at each of Gulf Power s coal-fired generating plants.
These studies indicate that, depending on the final requirements in these anticipated EPA
regulations and any legislation or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as
estimates of long-term fuel prices, Gulf Power may conclude that it is more economical to retire
certain of its coal-fired generating units prior to 2020 and to replace such units with new or
purchased capacity.

Also in December 2009, the Florida PSC adopted new numerical conservation goals for Gulf Power
along with other electric utilities in the state. The Florida PSC adopted more aggressive goals
due in part to the consideration of possible greenhouse gas emissions costs incurred in connection
with possible climate change legislation and a change in the manner in which the Florida PSC
considers the effect of so-called  free-riders  on the level of

I-13 

Table of Contents   

conservation reasonably achievable through utility programs. Gulf Power s plans and programs to
meet the new goals are scheduled to be submitted to the Florida PSC for review by the end of the
first quarter 2010. The costs of implementing Gulf Power s conservation plans and programs are
recovered through specific conservation recovery rates set annually by the Florida PSC.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Mississippi Power  

On December 7, 2009, Mississippi Power filed its 2010 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The filing was
made in connection with the Mississippi PSC certification proceedings relating to the proposed
Kemper County IGCC project. In the 2010 IRP, Mississippi Power projected that it will have a need
for new capacity in the 2013 to 2015 timeframe. The 2010 IRP indicated a need range of
approximately 200 megawatts to 300 megawatts in 2014, which reflects growth in load and the
anticipated retirement of older gas steam units Plant Eaton Units 1 through 3 and Plant Watson
Units 1 through 3 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In addition, due to potential retirements of
existing coal units, the Mississippi PSC found a need in 2015 that ranges from 304 megawatts to
1,276 megawatts.

The range of needs for 2015 is based on potential environmental regulations relating to maximum
achievable control technology for hazardous air pollutants, as well as potential legislation or
regulations that would impose mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. See
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Environmental Matters  
Environmental Statutes and Regulations   Air Quality  and  Environmental Matters   Global Climate
Issues  of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein. Depending on the final requirements in the
anticipated EPA regulations and any legislation or regulation relating to greenhouse gas emissions,
as well as estimates of long-term fuel prices, Mississippi Power may conclude that it is more
economical to discontinue burning coal at certain coal-fired generating units than to install the
required controls.

Mississippi Power s 2010 IRP indicated that Mississippi Power plans to construct the Kemper County
IGCC to meet its identified needs, to add environmental controls at Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, to
defer environmental controls at Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, and to continue operation of the
combined cycle Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Mississippi Base Load Construction Legislation 

In the 2008 regular session of the Mississippi legislature, a bill was passed and signed by the
Governor in May 2008 to enhance the Mississippi PSC s authority to facilitate development and
construction of base load generation in the State of Mississippi (Baseload Act). The Baseload
Act authorizes, but does not require, the Mississippi PSC to adopt a cost recovery mechanism
that includes in retail base rates, prior to and during construction, all or a portion of the
prudently incurred pre-construction and construction costs incurred by a utility in constructing
a base load electric generating plant. Prior to the passage of the Baseload Act, such costs
would traditionally be recovered only after the plant was placed in service. The Baseload Act
also provides for periodic prudence reviews by the Mississippi PSC and prohibits the
cancellation of any such generating plant without the approval of the Mississippi PSC. In the
event of cancellation of the construction of the plant without approval of the Mississippi PSC,
the Baseload Act authorizes the Mississippi PSC to make a public interest determination as to
whether and to what extent the utility will be afforded rate recovery for costs incurred in
connection with such cancelled generating plant. The effect of this legislation on Southern
Company and Mississippi Power cannot now be determined.

On January 16, 2009, Mississippi Power filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity
with the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. This certificate, if approved by the Mississippi PSC, would authorize
Mississippi Power to acquire, construct, and operate the Kemper IGCC and related facilities. The
Kemper IGCC, subject to federal and state reviews and certain regulatory approvals, is expected to
begin commercial operation in May 2014. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern
Company and Mississippi Power in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Employee Relations 

The Southern Company system had a total of 26,112 employees on its payroll at December 31,
2009.

* 
       
     Southern Holdings has agreements with SCS whereby all employee services are rendered at cost. 

** 
       
     Southern Power has no employees. Southern Power has agreements with SCS and the traditional
operating companies whereby employee services are rendered at amounts in compliance with FERC
regulations. 

The traditional operating companies have separate agreements with local unions of the IBEW
generally covering wages, working conditions, and procedures for handling grievances and
arbitration. These agreements apply with certain exceptions to operating, maintenance, and
construction employees.

On August 15, 2009, a five-year labor agreement between Alabama Power and nine local unions with
the IBEW expired. Prior to the expiration of this agreement, Alabama Power and the IBEW entered
into a new five-year labor agreement with a ratification date of May 29, 2009. Parts of this new
agreement took effect on August 15, 2009, when the original agreement expired, and the remainder
took effect on January 1, 2010. The new agreement expires on August 15, 2014.

Georgia Power has an agreement with the IBEW covering wages and working conditions, which is in
effect through June 30, 2011. Upon notice given at least 60 days prior to that date, negotiations
may be initiated with respect to agreement terms to be effective after such date.

The agreement between Gulf Power and the IBEW covering wages and working conditions was scheduled
to expire on October 15, 2009. The agreement has not been terminated by either party and remains
in effect through October 14, 2010. Negotiations for a new agreement began in September 2009 and
are on-going.

Mississippi Power has an agreement with the IBEW covering wages and working conditions, which is in
effect until August 16, 2010. Upon notice given at least 60 days prior to that date, negotiations
may be initiated with respect to agreement terms to be effective after such date.

Southern Nuclear and the IBEW ratified a labor agreement for certain employees at Plants Hatch and
Vogtle on May 21, 2009. The agreement is effective through June 30, 2011. A five-year agreement
between Southern Nuclear and the IBEW representing certain employees at Plant Farley was ratified
on July 8, 2009. The agreement became effective on August 15, 2009 and will remain in effect
through August 15, 2014.

The agreements also make the terms of the pension plans for the companies discussed above subject
to collective bargaining with the unions at either a five-year or a 10-year cycle, depending upon
union and company actions.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 of each registrant, and other documents filed by
Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC from time to time, the following factors
should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Such factors
could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries. 

Risks Related to the Energy Industry   

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation.
Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals,
permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries. 

Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern
Power, are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and
to obtain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from the governmental agencies that
regulate various aspects of their businesses, including rates and charges, service regulations,
retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies
and practices, and the operation of fossil-fuel, hydroelectric, and nuclear generating facilities.
For example, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional operating companies and by
Southern Power must be approved by the FERC. These wholesale rates could be affected absent the
ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC market-based rate authority. Additionally, the
respective state PSCs must approve the traditional operating companies  requested rates for retail
customers. While the retail rates of the traditional operating companies are designed to provide
for the full recovery of costs (including a reasonable return on invested capital), there can be no
assurance that a state PSC, in a future rate proceeding, will not attempt to alter the timing or
amount of certain costs for which recovery is sought or to modify the current authorized rate of
return.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe the necessary permits, approvals, and certificates
have been obtained for their respective existing operations and that their respective businesses
are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, the impact of any future revision or
changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations
applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries cannot now be predicted. Changes in
regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could influence the operating environment of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial costs.

Risks Related to Environmental and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation  

Southern Company s, the traditional operating companies , and Southern Power s costs of compliance
with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance with future environmental laws,
including laws and regulations designed to address global climate change, renewable energy
standards, air quality, coal combustion byproducts, and other matters and the incurrence of
environmental liabilities could affect unit retirement decisions and negatively impact the net
income, cash flows, and financial condition of Southern Company, the traditional operating
companies, or Southern Power. 

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to extensive
federal, state, and local environmental requirements which, among other things, regulate air
emissions, water usage and discharges, and the management of hazardous and solid waste in order to
adequately protect the environment. Compliance with these legal requirements requires Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power to commit significant expenditures
for installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and
permits at all of their respective facilities. These expenditures are significant and Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power expect that they will increase in
the future. Through 2009, Southern Company had invested approximately $7.5 billion in capital
projects to comply with these requirements, with annual totals of $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and
$1.5 billion for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Southern Company expects that capital
expenditures to assure compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an
additional $545 million, $721 million, and $1.2 billion for 2010, 2011, and 2012,

I-16 

Table of Contents   

respectively. Because the compliance strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental
laws, statutes, and regulations, the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions
allowances, and the fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time.

If Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power fails to comply with
environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may
result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines. The EPA has filed civil actions
against Alabama Power and Georgia Power and issued notices of violation to Gulf Power and
Mississippi Power alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act.
Southern Company is a party to suits alleging emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could require substantial
capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions,
and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered
through regulated rates or market-based rates for Southern Power.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States.
In particular, personal injury and other claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
materials, and common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly
caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have become more frequent.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations related to
global climate change, air quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other
environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to Southern Company, the
traditional operating companies, and Southern Power. For example, federal legislative proposals
that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy standards
continue to be actively considered in Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has
been identified as a high priority by the current Administration. On June 26, 2009, the American
Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which would impose mandatory greenhouse gas restrictions
through implementation of a cap and trade program, a renewable energy standard, and other measures,
was passed by the House of Representatives. Similar legislation is being considered by the Senate.
In 2007, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gas
emissions from new motor vehicles. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published a final determination,
which became effective on January 14, 2010, that certain greenhouse gas emissions from new motor
vehicles endanger public health and welfare due to climate change. The EPA has stated that
finalization of this rule will cause carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to become regulated
pollutants under certain provisions of the Clean Air Act applicable to stationary sources,
including power plants. On October 27, 2009, the EPA published a proposed rule governing how these
programs would be applied to such sources. The EPA has stated that it expects to finalize these
proposed rules in March 2010.

In addition, the EPA is expected to issue additional regulations and designations with respect to
air quality under the Clean Air Act, including eight-hour ozone standards, sulfur dioxide
standards, a replacement Clean Air Interstate Rule relating to nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions, and a Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule for coal and oil-fired electric
generating units, which will likely address numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury.

In addition, the EPA is currently evaluating whether additional regulation of coal combustion
byproducts is merited under federal solid and hazardous waste laws. The EPA is expected to issue a
proposal regarding additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts in early 2010.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. A nonbinding agreement was announced during the most recent round of
negotiations in December 2009 that included a pledge from both developed and developing countries
to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

The cost impact of such legislation, regulation, new interpretations, or international negotiations
would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time. For
example, the impact of currently proposed legislation relating to greenhouse gas emissions would
depend on a variety of factors, including the specific greenhouse gas emissions limits or renewable
energy requirements, the timing of implementation of these

I-17 

Table of Contents   

limits or requirements, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the level that must be
purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and commercial availability
of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions, the degree to which
offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any), the impact on coal
and natural gas prices, and cost recovery through regulated rates or
market-based rates for Southern Power.

Although the outcome cannot be determined at this time, legislation or regulation related to
greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards, air quality, coal combustion byproducts and
other matters, individually or together, are likely to result in significant and additional
compliance costs, including significant capital expenditures, and could result in additional
operating restrictions. These costs could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions,
and could result in the retirement of a significant number of coal-fired generating units of the
traditional operating companies. Additional compliance costs and costs related to potential unit
retirements could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs
are not recovered from customers. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates
could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively impact results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

General Risks Related to Operation of Southern Company s Utility Subsidiaries  

The regional power market in which Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries compete may have
changing transmission regulatory structures, which could affect the ownership of these assets and
related revenues and expenses. 

The traditional operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a
vertically integrated utility. Transmission revenues are not separated from generation and
distribution revenues in their approved retail rates. Current FERC efforts that may potentially
change the regulatory and/or operational structure of transmission include rules related to the
standardization of generation interconnection. The financial condition, net income, and cash flows
of Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries could be adversely affected by future changes in
the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

The net
income of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern
Power could be negatively impacted by competitive activity in the wholesale electricity markets. 

Competition at the wholesale level continues to expand and evolve in the electricity markets. As a
result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy, competition in the wholesale electricity
markets has increased due to greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers,
non-utility generators, IPPs, wholesale power marketers, and brokers. FERC rules related to
transmission are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale market on a nationwide basis
by providing greater flexibility and more choices to wholesale power customers, including
initiatives designed to promote and encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply.
Moreover, along with transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, futures contracts and
derivatives are traded on various commodities exchanges. Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, and Southern Power cannot predict the impact of these and other such
developments, nor can they predict the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand,
which are typically driven by factors beyond their control.

Risks Related to Southern Company and its Business  

Southern Company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay
dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay
funds to Southern Company. 

Southern Company is a holding company and, as such, Southern Company has no operations of its own.
Substantially all of Southern Company s consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Southern
Company s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is
primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay
upstream dividends or to repay funds to Southern Company. Prior to funding Southern Company,
Southern Company s subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be
satisfied, including among others, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends.
Southern Company s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide
Southern Company with funds for its payment obligations.

I-18 

Table of Contents   

The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if
they are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions. 

The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful
operation of its subsidiaries  electric generating, transmission, and distribution facilities.
Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:

operator error or failure of equipment or processes; 

operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory
requirements; 

labor disputes; 

terrorist attacks; 

fuel or material supply interruptions; 

compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security
standards; 

information technology system failure; 

cyber intrusion; and 

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts,
hurricanes, pandemic health events such as influenzas, or other similar occurrences. 

A severe drought could reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of
certain generating facilities. A decrease or elimination of revenues from the electric generation,
transmission, or distribution facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities
would reduce the net income and cash flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of
the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company.

The traditional operating companies could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of
mandatory reliability standards. 

As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, owners and operators of bulk power transmission
systems, including the traditional operating companies, are subject to mandatory reliability
standards enacted by the North American Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.
Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject the traditional operating companies
and Southern Company to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.
If any traditional operating company is found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability
standards, the traditional operating company could be subject to sanctions, including substantial
monetary penalties.

The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power depend in
part on sales under PPAs. The failure of a counterparty to one of these PPAs to perform its
obligations, or the failure to renew the PPAs, could have a negative impact on the net income and
cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. 

Most of Southern Power s generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. In addition,
the traditional operating companies enter into PPAs with non-affiliated parties. Revenues are
dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under these PPAs.
Even though Southern Power and the traditional operating companies have a rigorous credit
evaluation process, the failure of one of the purchasers to perform its obligations could have a
negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or
Southern Power and of Southern Company. Although these credit evaluations take into account the
possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater
than the

I-19 

Table of Contents   

credit evaluation predicts. Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional operating
company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on
what terms any renewals may be made. If a PPA is not renewed, a replacement PPA cannot be assured.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power may incur additional
costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to
recover their investments. The facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern
Power require ongoing capital expenditures. 

The businesses of the registrants require substantial capital expenditures for investments in new
facilities and capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and generation facilities,
including those to meet environmental standards. Certain of the traditional operating companies
and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding
environmental controls equipment at existing generating facilities. Southern Company intends to
continue its strategy of developing and constructing other new facilities, including new nuclear
generating units, combined cycle units, including the proposed integrated coal gasification
combined cycle facility, and the proposed biomass generating units, expanding existing facilities,
and adding environmental control equipment. These types of projects are long-term in nature and
may involve facility designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed. The
completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to
substantial risks, including:

shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; 

work stoppages; 

contractor or supplier non-performance under construction or other agreements; 

delays in or failure to receive necessary permits, approvals, and other regulatory
authorizations; 

impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and
regulations; 

continued public and policymaker support for such projects; 

adverse weather conditions; 

unforeseen engineering problems; 

changes in project design or scope; 

environmental and geological conditions; 

delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; 

unanticipated cost increases, including materials and labor; and 

attention to other projects. 

In addition, with respect to the construction of new nuclear units, a major incident at a nuclear
facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear
units. If a traditional operating company or Southern Power is unable to complete the development
or construction of a facility or decides to delay or cancel construction of a facility, it may not
be able to recover its investment in that facility and may incur substantial cancellation payments
under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts. Even if a construction project is
completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and there is no assurance that the
traditional operating company will be able to recover such expenditures through regulated rates.
In addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of
revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the net income and financial position of a traditional
operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company.

I-20 

Table of Contents   

Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, a traditional
operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company may incur liabilities and suffer reduced
plant efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income.

Once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital expenditures are required to
maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the traditional operating
companies  existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even
if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital
expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to
provide reliable operations.

Changes in technology may make Southern Company s electric generating facilities owned by the
traditional operating companies and Southern Power less competitive. 

A key element of the business model of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and
Southern Power is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale
and produces power at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that
produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells. It is possible
that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a
level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production. If this were
to happen and if these technologies achieved economies of scale, the market share of Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could be eroded, and the value of
their respective electric generating facilities could be reduced. It is also possible that rapid
advances in central station power generation technology could reduce the value of the current
electric generating facilities owned by Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and
Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric
customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of
Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power.

Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health,
regulatory, terrorism, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of Southern
Company s nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential
exposures in excess of insurance coverage. 

Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds
undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units and the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The six existing units are operated by Southern
Nuclear and represent approximately 3,680 megawatts, or 8.6%, of Southern Company s generation
capacity as of December 31, 2009. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, health, and
financial risks such as on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent
nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, potential liabilities
arising out of the operation of these facilities, and the threat of a possible terrorist attack.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to
minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed
the amount of insurance coverage.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements
for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has
the authority to impose fines or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity
of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased
security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Alabama
Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear
plants. In addition, although Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Company have no reason to
anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could result in
substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a
nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or
licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.

In addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities could result in
increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict.

The generation operations and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks, many of which are beyond their
control, including 

I-21 

Table of Contents   

changes in power prices and fuel costs, that may reduce Southern Company s, the traditional
operating companies , and Southern Power s revenues and increase costs. 

The generation operations and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to changes in power prices or fuel costs, which
could increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, and Southern Power receive from the sale of power. The market prices for
these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time. Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power attempt to mitigate risks
associated with fluctuating fuel costs by passing these costs on to customers through the
traditional operating companies  fuel cost recovery clauses or through PPAs. Among the factors
that could influence power prices and fuel costs are:

prevailing market prices for coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, and other
fuels used in the generation facilities of the traditional operating companies and
Southern Power including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such
commodities; 

demand for energy and the extent of additional supplies of energy available
from current or new competitors; 

liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market; 

weather conditions impacting demand for electricity; 

seasonality; 

transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies; 

availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources; 

forced or unscheduled plant outages for the Southern Company system, its
competitors, or third party providers; 

the financial condition of market participants; 

the economy in the service territory, the nation, and worldwide, including the
impact of economic conditions on industrial and commercial demand for electricity and
the worldwide demand for fuels; 

natural disasters, wars, embargos, acts of terrorism, and other catastrophic
events; and 

federal, state, and foreign energy and environmental regulation and
legislation. 

Certain of these factors could increase the expenses of the traditional operating companies or
Southern Power and Southern Company. For the traditional operating companies, such increases may
not be fully recoverable through rates. Other of these factors could reduce the revenues of the
traditional operating companies or Southern Power and Southern Company.

Historically, the traditional operating companies from time to time have experienced underrecovered
fuel cost balances and deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances and may experience
such balances in the future. While the traditional operating companies are generally authorized to
recover underrecovered fuel costs through fuel cost recovery clauses and storm recovery costs
through special rate provisions administered by the respective PSCs, recovery may be denied if
costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred and delays in the authorization of such recovery could
negatively impact the cash flows of the affected traditional operating company and Southern
Company.

I-22 

Table of Contents   

A downgrade in the credit ratings of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or
Southern Power could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or
could require Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power to post
collateral or replace certain indebtedness. 

There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for
Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power, including capital
structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other
commitments for capital. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power
could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any of the rating agencies conclude that the level
of business or financial risk of the industry or Southern Company, the traditional operating
companies, or Southern Power has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies
could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade
Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power, borrowing costs would
increase, its pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for
any downgrade to below investment grade, collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of
contracts.

The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of
business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of Southern Company
and its subsidiaries. 

Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern
Power, use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their
commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, engage in limited trading
activities. Southern Company and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of
volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These
risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures. These risk management
policies, limits, and procedures might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks
associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered for hedging purposes
might not off-set the underlying exposure being hedged as expected resulting in financial losses.
In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the
valuation of these financial instruments can involve management s judgment or use of estimates.
The factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the
calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made. As a
result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect
the value of the reported fair value of these contracts.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power may not be able to obtain adequate fuel
supplies, which could limit their ability to operate their facilities. 

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power purchase fuel, including coal, natural gas,
uranium, and fuel oil, from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including
disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations,
force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could
limit the ability of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to operate their
respective facilities, and thus reduce the net income of the affected traditional operating company
or Southern Power and Southern Company.

The traditional operating companies are dependent on coal for much of their electric generating
capacity. Each traditional operating company has coal supply contracts in place; however, there
can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to
supply coal to the traditional operating companies. The suppliers under these agreements may
experience financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations
to the traditional operating companies. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not
be required to supply coal to the traditional operating companies under certain circumstances, such
as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional operating companies are unable to obtain
their coal requirements under these contracts, the traditional operating companies may be required
to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, which may not be fully recoverable through
rates.

In addition, Southern Power in particular, and the traditional operating companies to a lesser
extent, are dependent on natural gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity. Natural
gas supplies can be subject to disruption in

I-23 

Table of Contents   

the event production or distribution is curtailed, such as in the event of a hurricane.

In addition, world market conditions for fuels can impact the availability of natural gas, coal,
and uranium.

Demand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity
in the open market or building additional generation capabilities. 

Through the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, Southern Company is currently
obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At
peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed Southern Company s
available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional
operating companies or Southern Power purchase capacity on the open market or build additional
generation capabilities. Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to
pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional operating
companies may not be able to recover any of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag
associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and
the traditional operating companies  recovery in customers  rates. Under Southern Power s
long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power would not have the ability to recover any of these
costs. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected
traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company.

Demand for power could decrease or fail to grow at expected rates, resulting in stagnant or reduced
revenues, limited growth opportunities, and potentially stranded generation assets. 

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power each engage in a
long-term planning process to determine the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets
required to serve future load obligations. This planning process must look many years into the
future in order to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction
of new generation facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand this far into the future
as these future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including regional economic
conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.
Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to adjust rates to recover
the costs of new generation assets while such assets are being constructed, the traditional
operating companies may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory
lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of additional capacity and the
traditional operating companies  recovery in customers  rates. Under Southern Power s model of
selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power
might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original
forecasts. Southern Power may not be able to extend its existing PPAs or to find new buyers for
existing generation assets as existing PPAs expire, or it may be forced to market these assets at
prices lower than originally intended. These situations could have negative impacts on net income
and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern
Company.

The operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power
are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. In
addition,  significant weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,
and droughts, or  a terrorist attack could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of
the properties of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power and could negatively
impact results of operation, financial condition, and liquidity. 

Electric power supply is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country, demand for
power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other
areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of
Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in the future may
fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the traditional operating companies and
Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather conditions are milder. Unusually
mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net income, available cash, and borrowing
ability of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power.

In addition, volatile or significant weather events or a terrorist attack could result in
substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional operating
companies and the generating facilities of the

I-24 

Table of Contents   

traditional operating companies and Southern Power. The traditional operating companies and
Southern Power have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions which could be
subject to major storm activity. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of
water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
damages from weather events to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured
damages to its generating facilities and other property. In the event a traditional operating
company experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster, or other catastrophic
event, such as a terrorist attack, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage
is subject to the approval of its state PSC. While the traditional operating companies generally
are entitled to recover prudently incurred costs incurred in connection with such an event, any
denial by the applicable state PSC or delay in recovery of any portion of such costs could have a
material negative impact on a traditional operating company s and Southern Company s results of
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events within the service territory of any
traditional operating company or affecting Southern Power s customers may result in the loss of
customers and reduced demand for electricity. For example, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of
Mississippi in August 2005 and caused substantial damage within Mississippi Power s service
territory. As of December 31, 2009, Mississippi Power had approximately 4.6% fewer retail
customers as compared to pre-storm levels. Any significant loss of customers or reduction in
demand for electricity could have a material negative impact on a traditional operating company s,
Southern Power s, and Southern Company s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact Southern
Company s and its subsidiaries  results of operations. 

Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset to future
needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs.
Such operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period
associated with skill development, especially with the workforce needs associated with new nuclear
construction. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability
to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the
future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its
subsidiaries  ability to manage and operate their businesses. If Southern Company and its
subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies, are unable to successfully attract and
retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Risks Related to Market and Economic Volatility  

The business of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power is
dependent on their ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial
institutions. The inability of Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern
Power to access funds may limit its ability to execute its business plan by impacting its ability
to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional operating
companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. 

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely on access to both
short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for
capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If Southern
Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power is not able to access capital at
competitive rates, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited by impacting its
ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash
flows. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely
on committed bank lending agreements as back-up liquidity which allows them to access low cost
money markets. Each of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power
believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current
credit ratings. However, certain market disruptions may increase its cost of borrowing or
adversely affect its ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing
arrangements or its ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of

I-25 

Table of Contents   

capital. Such disruptions could include:

an economic downturn or uncertainty; 

the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or financial institution; 

capital markets volatility and interruption; 

financial institution distress; 

market prices for electricity and gas; 

terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on Southern Company s facilities or
unrelated energy companies  facilities; 

war or threat of war; or 

the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries. 

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plans and decommissioning
trust assets or may increase medical costs, which then could require significant additional
funding. 

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under
Southern Company s pension and postretirement benefit plans and the assets held in trust to satisfy
obligations to decommission Alabama Power s and Georgia Power s nuclear plants. Southern Company,
Alabama Power, and Georgia Power have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant
assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain
returns, which may fall below projected return rates. A decline in the market value of these
assets, as has been experienced in prior periods, may increase the funding requirements relating to
Southern Company s benefit plan liabilities and Alabama Power s and Georgia Power s decommissioning
obligations. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Southern
Company s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities
increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including
increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the
funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. Southern Company and
its subsidiaries are also facing rising medical benefit costs, including the current costs for
active and retired employees. It is possible that these costs may increase at a rate that is
significantly higher than anticipated. If Southern Company is unable to successfully manage
benefit plan assets and medical benefit costs and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are unable to
successfully manage the decommissioning trust funds, results of operations and financial position
could be negatively affected. Additionally, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may also be
affected by the potential passage of healthcare legislation.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks
associated with a changing economic environment, which could impact their ability to obtain
adequate insurance and the financial stability of the customers of the traditional operating
companies and Southern Power. 

The financial condition of some insurance companies, the threat of terrorism, and the hurricanes
that affected the Gulf Coast, among other things, have had disruptive effects on the insurance
industry. The availability of insurance covering risks that Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, Southern Power, and their respective competitors typically insure against may
decrease, and the insurance that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and
Southern Power are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more
restrictive policy terms.

Additionally, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are exposed
to risks related to general economic conditions in their applicable service territory and are thus
impacted by the economic cycles of the customers each serves. Any economic downturn or disruption
of financial markets could negatively affect the financial stability of the customers and
counterparties of the traditional operating companies and Southern

I-26 

Table of Contents   

Power. As territories served by the traditional operating companies and Southern Power experience
economic downturns, energy consumption patterns may change and revenues may be negatively impacted.
Additionally, customers could voluntarily reduce their consumption of electricity in response to
decreases in their disposable income or individual conservation efforts. If commercial and
industrial customers experience economic downturns, their consumption of electricity may decline.
As a result, revenues may be negatively impacted.

Further, the results of operations of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power are
affected by customer growth in their applicable service territory. Customer growth and customer
usage can be affected by economic factors in the service territory of the traditional operating
companies and Southern Power and elsewhere, including, for example, job and income growth, housing
starts, and new home prices. A population decline and/or business closings in the territory served
by the traditional operating companies or Southern Power or slower than anticipated customer growth
as a result of the current recession or otherwise could also have a negative impact on revenues and
could result in greater expense for uncollectible customer balances.

As with other parts of the country, the territories served by the traditional operating companies
and Southern Power have been impacted by the current economic recession. The traditional operating
companies have experienced some decline in the rate of residential and commercial sales growth, and
also have experienced declining sales to commercial and industrial customers due to the economic
recession. Southern Power is expected to experience reduced future revenues for its requirements
customers due to the economic recession. The timing and extent of the recovery cannot be
predicted.

These and the other factors discussed above could adversely affect Southern Company s, the
traditional operating companies , and Southern Power s level of future net income.

Energy conservation and energy price increases could negatively impact financial results. 

A number of regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements
and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Conservation programs
could impact the financial results of Southern Company, the traditional operating
companies, and Southern Power in different ways. To the extent conservation results in
reduced energy demand or significantly slows the growth in demand, the value of wholesale
generation assets of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power and other
unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted. In addition, conservation
could negatively impact the traditional operating companies depending on the regulatory
treatment of the associated impacts. If any traditional operating company is required to
invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation,
regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative
financial impact on such traditional operating company and Southern Company. Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could also be impacted if
any future energy price increases result in a decrease in customer usage. Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are unable to determine
what impact, if any, conservation and increases in energy prices will have on financial
condition or results of operations.

Except as discussed below under  Titles to Property,  the principal plants and other important
units of the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO are owned in fee by the
respective companies. It is the opinion of management of each such company that its operating
properties are adequately maintained and are substantially in good operating condition.

Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased to
Entergy Gulf States. The line, completed in 1984, extends from Plant Daniel to the Louisiana state
line. Entergy Gulf States is paying a use fee over a 40-year period covering all expenses and the
amortization of the original $57 million cost of the line. At December 31, 2009, the unamortized
portion of this cost was approximately $21 million.

In 2009, the maximum demand on the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO was
34,471,000 kilowatts and occurred on June 22, 2009. The all-time maximum demand of 38,777,000
kilowatts on the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO occurred on August 22,
2007. These amounts exclude demand served by capacity retained by MEAG Power, OPC, and SEPA. The
reserve margin for the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO in 2009 was

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Southern Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an
adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of Southern Company s
internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in  Internal
Control Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Southern Company s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

Deloitte   Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of Southern
Company s financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Southern
Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. Deloitte   Touche

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Southern Company 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
capitalization of Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (the  Company ) as of December 31, 2009
and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders 
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. We also
have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based
on criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company s management is responsible for
these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (page II-9).
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the
Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages II-40 to II-93) referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company and Subsidiary

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

OVERVIEW 

Business Activities 

The primary business of Southern Company (the Company) is electricity sales in the Southeast
by the traditional operating companies   Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi
Power   and Southern Power. The four traditional operating companies are vertically integrated
utilities providing electric service in four Southeastern states. Southern Power constructs,
acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the
wholesale market.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company s electricity
business. These factors include the traditional operating companies  ability to maintain a
constructive regulatory environment, to maintain energy sales given the effects of the recession,
and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of rising costs. Each of the traditional
operating companies has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery.
Appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue
to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future.

Another major factor is the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale generating
business and federal regulatory policy, which may impact Southern Company s level of participation
in this market. The Company continues to face regulatory challenges related to transmission issues
at the national level. Southern Power continues to execute its strategy through a combination of
acquiring and constructing new power plants and by entering into power purchase agreements (PPAs)
with investor owned utilities, independent power producers, municipalities, and electric
cooperatives.

Southern Company s other business activities include investments in leveraged lease projects,
renewable energy projects, and telecommunications. Management continues to evaluate the
contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions
and dispositions accordingly.

Key Performance Indicators 

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to more than four
million customers, Southern Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators
include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and earnings per share
(EPS), excluding the MC Asset Recovery, LLC (MC Asset Recovery) litigation settlement discussed
below. Southern Company s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers.
Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and
competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to
evaluate the Company s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of fossil/hydro and
nuclear plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when
generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced
outages by total generation hours. The fossil/hydro 2009 Peak Season EFOR of 1.44% was better than
the target. The nuclear 2009 Peak Season EFOR of 2.61% was slightly better than the target.
Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is measured by the frequency and
duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set internally based on historical
performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital expenditures. The performance for
2009 was better than the target for these reliability measures.

Southern Company entered into a settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery to resolve a complaint
alleging that Southern Company caused Mirant Corporation (Mirant) to engage in certain fraudulent
transfers and to pay illegal dividends to Southern Company prior to the spin-off of Mirant in 2001.
Pursuant to the settlement, Southern Company recorded a charge of $202 million in 2009. The
settlement has been completed and resolves all claims by MC Asset Recovery against Southern
Company. Southern Company management uses the non-GAAP (defined below) measure of EPS, excluding
the MC Asset Recovery litigation settlement, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company s
ongoing business activities. Southern Company believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure
of earnings and EPS excluding the MC Asset Recovery litigation settlement is useful for investors
because it provides earnings information that is consistent with the historical and ongoing
business activities of the Company. The presentation of this information is not meant to be
considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP).

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Southern Company s 2009 results compared with its targets for some of these key indicators are
reflected in the following chart:

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company s financial performance.
The performance achieved in 2009 reflects the continued emphasis that management places on these
indicators as well as the commitment shown by employees in achieving or exceeding management s
expectations.

Earnings 

Southern Company s net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock of subsidiaries was
$1.64 billion in 2009, a decrease of $99 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily
the result of a litigation settlement with MC Asset Recovery, a decrease in revenues from lower
kilowatt-hour (KWH) demand across all customer classes, a decrease in revenues from market-response
rates to large commercial and industrial customers, higher depreciation and amortization, higher
interest expense, and unfavorable weather. The 2009 decrease was partially offset by an increase
in revenues from customer charges at Alabama Power, increased recognition of environmental
compliance cost recovery (ECCR) revenues at Georgia Power in accordance with its retail rate plan
for the years 2008 through 2010 (2007 Retail Rate Plan), lower operations and maintenance expenses,
an increase in allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) equity, which is not taxable, a
2008 charge related to the tax treatment of leveraged lease investments, and a gain on the early
retirement of two international leveraged lease investments. Net income after dividends on
preferred and preference stock of subsidiaries was $1.74 billion in 2008 and $1.73 billion in 2007.
Basic EPS was $2.07 in 2009, $2.26 in 2008, and $2.29 in 2007. Diluted EPS, which factors in
additional shares related to stock-based compensation, was $2.06 in 2009, $2.25 in 2008, and $2.28
in 2007.

Dividends 

Southern Company has paid dividends on its common stock since 1948. Dividends paid per share of
common stock were $1.7325 in 2009, $1.6625 in 2008, and $1.595 in 2007. In January 2010, Southern
Company declared a quarterly dividend of 43.75 cents per share. This is the 249th consecutive
quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter.
The Company targets a dividend payout ratio of approximately 65% to 70% of net income. For 2009,
the actual payout ratio was 83.3% while the payout ratio of net income excluding the MC Asset
Recovery litigation settlement was 74.2%.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Electricity Business 

Southern Company s electric utilities generate and sell electricity to retail and wholesale
customers in the Southeast. A condensed statement of income for the electricity business follows:

Electric Operating Revenues  

Details of electric operating revenues were as follows:

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Retail revenues decreased $748 million, increased $1.4 billion, and increased $838 million in 2009,
2008, and 2007, respectively. The significant factors driving these changes are shown in the
preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in
revenues from customer charges at Alabama Power and increased recognition of ECCR revenues at
Georgia Power in accordance with its 2007 Retail Rate Plan, partially offset by a decrease in
revenues from market-response rates to large commercial and industrial customers at Georgia Power.
The 2008 increase in rates and pricing when compared to the prior year was primarily due to Alabama
Power s increase under its Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate RSE), as ordered by the
Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC), and Georgia Power s increase under its 2007 Retail Rate
Plan, as ordered by the Georgia PSC. Also contributing to the 2008 increase was an increase in
revenues from market-response rates to large commercial and industrial customers. The 2007
increase in rates and pricing when compared to the prior year was primarily due to Alabama Power s
increase under its Rate RSE, as ordered by the Alabama PSC. Partially offsetting the 2007 increase
was a decrease in revenues from market-response rates to large commercial and industrial customers.
See  Energy Sales  below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including
changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.

Electric rates for the traditional operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these
provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the fuel component of purchased
power, and do not affect net income. The traditional operating companies may also have one or more
regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental, storm damage, new plants, and
PPAs.

Wholesale revenues consist of PPAs with investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives, unit
power sales contracts, and short-term opportunity sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at
market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Company s variable cost to produce the
energy.

In 2009, wholesale revenues decreased $598 million. Wholesale fuel revenues, which are generally
offset by wholesale fuel expenses and do not affect net income, decreased $603 million in 2009.
Excluding wholesale fuel revenues, wholesale revenues increased $5 million primarily due to
additional revenues associated with a new PPA at Southern Power s Plant Franklin Unit 3 which began
in January 2009, partially offset by fewer short-term opportunity sales due to lower gas prices and
reduced margins on short-term opportunity sales.

In 2008, wholesale revenues increased $412 million primarily as a result of a 21.8% increase in the
average cost of fuel per net KWH generated, as well as revenues resulting from new and existing
PPAs and revenues derived from contracts for Southern Power s Plant Oleander Unit 5 and Plant
Franklin Unit 3 placed in operation in December 2007 and June 2008, respectively. The 2008
increase was partially offset by a decrease in short-term opportunity sales and weather-related
generation load reductions.

In 2007, wholesale revenues increased $166 million primarily as a result of a 9.5% increase in the
average cost of fuel per net KWH generated. Excluding fuel, wholesale revenues were flat when
compared to the prior year.

Revenues associated with PPAs and opportunity sales were as follows:

II-14 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Capacity revenues under unit power sales contracts, principally sales to Florida utilities, reflect
the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Unit power KWH sales decreased 7.5%, 2.1%,
and 0.8% in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which
are the primary fuel sources for unit power sales contracts, influence changes in these sales. See
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Alabama Power  herein for additional information
regarding the termination of certain unit power sales contracts in 2010. However, because the
energy is generally sold at variable cost, these fluctuations have a minimal effect on earnings.
The capacity and energy components of the unit power sales contracts were as follows:

Energy Sales  

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to
year. KWH sales for 2009 and the percent change by year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales decreased 7.7 billion KWHs
in 2009 primarily as a result of lower usage by industrial customers due to the recessionary
economy. Reduced demand in the primary metal, chemical, and textile sectors, as well as the stone,
clay, and glass sector, contributed most significantly to the decrease in industrial KWH sales.
Unfavorable weather also contributed to lower KWH sales across all customer classes. The number of
customers in 2009 was flat compared to 2008. Retail energy sales in 2008 decreased 3.4 billion
KWHs as a result of a 1.4% decrease in electricity usage mainly due to a slowing economy that
worsened during the fourth quarter. The 2008 decrease in residential sales resulted primarily from
lower home occupancy rates in Southern Company s service area when compared to 2007. Throughout
the year, reduced demand in the textile sector, the lumber sector, and the stone, clay, and glass
sector contributed to the decrease in 2008 industrial sales. Additional weakness in the fourth
quarter 2008 affected all major industrial segments. Significantly less favorable weather in 2008
when compared to 2007 also contributed to the 2008 decrease in retail energy sales. These
decreases were partially offset by customer growth of 0.6%. Retail energy sales in 2007 increased
2.3 billion KWHs as a result of 1.3% customer growth and favorable weather in 2007 when compared to
2006. The 2007 decrease in industrial sales primarily resulted from reduced demand and closures
within the textile sector, as well as decreased demand in the primary metals sector and the stone,
clay, and glass sector.

Wholesale energy sales decreased by 5.9 billion KWHs in 2009, decreased by 1.4 billion KWHs in
2008, and increased by 2.3 billion KWHs in 2007. The decrease in wholesale energy sales in 2009
was primarily related to fewer short-term opportunity sales driven by lower gas prices and fewer
uncontracted generating units at Southern Power available to sell electricity on the wholesale
market. The decrease in wholesale energy sales in 2008 was primarily related to longer planned
maintenance outages at a fossil unit in 2008 as compared to 2007 which reduced the availability of
this unit for wholesale sales. Lower short-term opportunity sales primarily related to higher coal
prices also contributed to the 2008 decrease. These decreases were partially offset by Plant
Oleander Unit 5 and Plant Franklin Unit 3 being placed in operation in December 2007 and June 2008,
respectively. The increase in wholesale energy sales in 2007 was primarily related to new PPAs
acquired by Southern Company through the acquisition of Plant Rowan in September 2006, as well as
new contracts with EnergyUnited Electric Membership Corporation that commenced in September 2006
and January 2007. An increase in KWH sales under existing PPAs also contributed to the 2007
increase.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses  

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the electric utilities. The mix of fuel
sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel
consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase
a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market. Details of electricity generated
and purchased by the electric utilities were as follows:

* 
       
     Fuel includes fuel purchased by the Company for tolling agreements where
power is generated by the provider and is included in purchased power when determining the average cost of purchased power. 

In 2009, fuel and purchased power expenses were $6.4 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion or
15.8% below 2008 costs. This decrease was primarily the result of an
$839 million decrease related
to the total KWHs generated and purchased due primarily to lower customer demand. Also
contributing to this decrease was a $367 million reduction in the average cost of fuel and
purchased power resulting primarily from a 39.6% decrease in the cost of gas per KWH generated.

In 2008, fuel and purchased power expenses were $7.6 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 20.0%
above 2007 costs. This increase was primarily the result of a $1.3 billion net increase in the
average cost of fuel and purchased power partially resulting from a 25.3% increase in the cost of
coal per net KWH generated and a 14.2% increase in the cost of gas per net KWH generated.

In 2007, fuel and purchased power expenses were $6.4 billion, an increase of $673 million or 11.8%
above 2006 costs. This increase was primarily the result of a $543 million net increase in the
average cost of fuel and purchased power partially resulting from a 51.4% decrease in hydro
generation as a result of a severe drought. Also contributing to this increase was a $130 million
increase related to higher net KWHs generated and purchased.

Coal prices continued to be influenced by worldwide demand from developing countries, as well as
increased mining and fuel transportation costs. While coal prices reached unprecedented high
levels in 2008, the recessionary economy pushed prices downward in 2009. However, the lower prices
did not fully offset the higher priced coal already in inventory and under long-term contract.
Demand for natural gas in the United States also was affected by the recessionary economy leading
to significantly lower natural gas prices. During 2009, uranium prices continued to moderate from
the highs set during 2007. Worldwide production levels increased in 2009; however, secondary
supplies and inventories were still required to meet worldwide reactor demand.

Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
traditional operating companies  fuel cost recovery provisions. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  
 PSC Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  herein for additional information. Likewise, Southern Power s
PPAs generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for substantially all of the cost of
fuel.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses  

Other operations and maintenance expenses were $3.4 billion, $3.6 billion, and $3.5 billion,
decreasing $183 million, increasing $111 million, and increasing $183 million in 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively. Discussion of significant variances for components of other operations and
maintenance expenses follows.

II-16 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Other production expenses at fossil, hydro, and nuclear plants decreased $70 million, increased $63
million, and increased $128 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Production expenses
fluctuate from year to year due to variations in outage schedules and normal changes in the cost of
labor and materials. Other production costs decreased in 2009 mainly due to a $104 million
decrease related to less planned spending on outages and maintenance, as well as other cost
containment activities, which were the results of efforts to offset the effects of the recessionary
economy. The 2009 decrease was partially offset by a $6 million increase related to new
facilities, a $5 million loss on the transfer of Southern Power s Plant Desoto in 2009, a $6
million gain recognized in 2008 by Southern Power on the sale of an undeveloped tract of land to
the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC), and a $17 million increase in nuclear refueling costs. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under  Property, Plant, and Equipment  for additional
information regarding nuclear refueling costs. Other production expenses increased in 2008
primarily due to a $64 million increase related to expenses incurred for maintenance outages at
generating units and a $30 million increase related to labor and materials expenses, partially
offset by a $15 million decrease in nuclear refueling costs. The 2008 increase was also partially
offset by a $24 million decrease related to new facilities, mainly lower costs associated with the
2007 write-off of Southern Power s integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) project with
the OUC. Other production expenses increased in 2007 primarily due to a $40 million increase
related to expenses incurred for maintenance outages at generating units and a $29 million increase
related to new facilities, mainly costs associated with the write-off of Southern Power s IGCC
project and the acquisitions of Plants DeSoto and Rowan by Southern Power in June and September
2006, respectively. A $25 million increase related to labor and materials expenses and a $22
million increase in nuclear refueling costs also contributed to the 2007 increase.

Transmission
and distribution expenses decreased $41 million, increased $4 million, and increased
$21 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Transmission and distribution expenses
fluctuate from year to year due to variations in maintenance schedules and normal changes in the
cost of labor and materials. Transmission and distribution expenses decreased in 2009 primarily
related to lower planned spending, as well as other cost containment activities. The 2008 increase
in transmission and distribution expenses was not material when compared to the prior year.
Transmission and distribution expenses increased in 2007 primarily as a result of increases in
labor and materials costs and maintenance associated with additional investment to meet customer
growth.

Customer sales and service expenses decreased $42 million, increased $32 million, and increased $7
million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Customer sales and service expenses decreased in
2009 primarily as a result of a $12 million decrease in customer service expenses, an $8 million
decrease in meter reading expenses, a $10 million decrease in sales expenses, and a $7 million
decrease in customer records related expenses. The 2008 increase in customer sales and service
expenses was primarily a result of an increase in customer service expenses, including a $13
million increase in uncollectible accounts expense, a $9 million increase in meter reading
expenses, and an $8 million increase for customer records and collections. The 2007 increase in
customer sales and service expenses was not material when compared to the prior year.

Administrative and general expenses decreased $30 million, increased $12 million, and increased $27
million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The 2009 decrease in administrative and general
expenses was primarily the result of cost containment activities which were the results of efforts
to offset the effects of the recessionary economy. The 2008 increase in administrative and general
expenses was not material when compared to 2007. Administrative and general expenses increased in
2007 primarily as a result of a $16 million increase in legal costs and expenses associated with an
increase in employees. Also contributing to the 2007 increase was a $14 million increase in
accrued expenses for the litigation and workers  compensation reserve, partially offset by an $8
million decrease in property damage expense.

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization increased $62 million in 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in
plant in service related to environmental, transmission, and distribution projects mainly at
Alabama Power and Georgia Power and the completion of Southern Power s Plant Franklin Unit 3, as
well as an increase in depreciation rates at Southern Power. Partially offsetting the 2009
increase was a decrease associated with the amortization of the regulatory liability related to the
cost of removal obligations as authorized by the Georgia PSC. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Cost of Removal  for additional
information regarding Georgia Power s cost of removal amortization.

Depreciation and amortization increased $199 million in 2008 primarily as a result of an increase
in plant in service related to environmental, transmission, and distribution projects mainly at
Alabama Power and Georgia Power and generation projects at Georgia Power. An increase in
depreciation rates at Georgia Power and Southern Power also contributed to the 2008 increase, as
well as the expiration of a rate order previously allowing Georgia Power to levelize certain
purchased power capacity costs and the completion of Plant Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007 and
Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008.

II-17 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Depreciation and amortization increased $51 million in 2007 primarily as a result of an increase in
plant in service related to environmental, transmission, and distribution projects mainly at
Alabama Power and Georgia Power. An increase in the amortization expense of a regulatory liability
recorded in 2003 in connection with the Mississippi PSC s accounting order on Plant Daniel capacity
also contributed to the 2007 increase. Partially offsetting the 2007 increase was a reduction in
amortization expense due to a Georgia Power regulatory liability related to the levelization of
certain purchased power capacity costs as ordered by the Georgia PSC under the terms of the retail
rate order effective January 1, 2005. See Note 1 to the financial statements under  Depreciation
and Amortization  for additional information.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes  

Taxes other than income taxes increased $22 million in 2009 primarily as a result of increases in
the bases of state and municipal public utility license taxes at Alabama Power and an increase in
franchise fees at Gulf Power. Increases in franchise fees are associated with increases in
revenues from energy sales. Taxes other than income taxes increased $56 million in 2008 primarily
as a result of increases in franchise fees and municipal gross receipt taxes associated with
increases in revenues from energy sales, as well as increases in property taxes associated with
property tax actualizations and additional plant in service. Taxes other than income taxes
increased $23 million in 2007 primarily as a result of increases in franchise and municipal gross
receipts taxes associated with increases in revenues from energy sales, partially offset by a
decrease in property taxes resulting from the resolution of a dispute with Monroe County, Georgia.

Other Income (Expense), Net  

Other income (expense), net increased $53 million in 2009 primarily due to an increase in AFUDC
equity as a result of environmental projects at Alabama Power and Gulf Power and additional
investments in transmission and distribution projects at Alabama Power. In addition, during 2009,
Southern Power recognized a $13 million profit under a construction contract with the OUC whereby
Southern Power provided engineering, procurement, and construction services to build a combined
cycle unit. Other income (expense), net increased $26 million in 2008 primarily as a result of an
increase in AFUDC equity related to additional investments in environmental equipment at generating
plants at Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Gulf Power, as well as additional investments in
transmission and distribution projects mainly at Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Other income
(expense), net increased $66 million in 2007 primarily as a result of an increase in AFUDC equity
related to additional investments in environmental equipment at generating plants and transmission
and distribution projects mainly at Alabama Power and Georgia Power.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized  

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $61 million in 2009 primarily as a
result of a $100 million increase associated with $1.4 billion in additional debt outstanding at
December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. Also contributing to the 2009 increase was $16
million in other interest costs. The 2009 increase was partially offset by $42 million related to
lower average interest rates on existing variable rate debt and $13 million of additional
capitalized interest as compared to 2008.

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $10 million in 2008 primarily as a
result of a $65 million increase associated with $1.8 billion in additional debt outstanding at
December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. Also contributing to the 2008 increase was $5
million in other interest costs. The 2008 increase was partially offset by $55 million related to
lower average interest rates on existing variable rate debt and $7 million of additional
capitalized interest as compared to 2007.

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $46 million in 2007 primarily as a
result of a $59 million increase associated with $703 million in additional debt outstanding at
December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 and higher interest rates associated with the
issuance of new long-term debt. Also contributing to the 2007 increase was $7 million related to
higher average interest rates on existing variable rate debt and $19 million in other interest
costs. The 2007 increase was partially offset by $38 million of additional capitalized interest as
compared to 2006.

Income Taxes  

Income taxes decreased $49 million in 2009 primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings as compared to
2008, an increase in AFUDC equity, which is not taxable, and an increase in the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code), Section 199 production activities deduction. See
Note 5 to the financial statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for additional information.

II-18 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Income taxes increased $87 million in 2008 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings as compared to
2007 and a 2007 deduction for a Georgia Power land donation. The 2008 increase was partially
offset by an increase in AFUDC equity, which is not taxable.

Income taxes were relatively flat in 2007 as higher pre-tax earnings as compared to 2006 were
largely offset due to a deduction for a Georgia Power land donation; an increase in AFUDC equity,
which is not taxable; and an increase in the Section 199 production activities deduction.

Dividends on Preferred and Preference Stock of Subsidiaries  

Dividends on preferred and preference stock of subsidiaries for 2009 were flat compared to the
prior year.

Dividends on preferred and preference stock of subsidiaries increased $17 million in 2008 primarily
as a result of issuances of $320 million and $150 million of preference stock in the third and
fourth quarters of 2007, respectively, partially offset by the redemption of $125 million of
preferred stock in January 2008.

Dividends on preferred and preference stock of subsidiaries increased $13 million in 2007 primarily
as a result of a $470 million increase associated with additional preference stock outstanding at
December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006.

Other Business Activities 

Southern Company s other business activities include the parent company (which does not allocate
operating expenses to business units), investments in leveraged lease projects, and
telecommunications. Southern Company s investment in synthetic fuel projects ended at December 31,
2007. These businesses are classified in general categories and may comprise one or more of the
following subsidiaries: Southern Company Holdings invests in various projects, including leveraged
lease projects; SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern
Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides
fiber cable services within the Southeast.

A condensed statement of income for Southern Company s other business activities follows:

Operating Revenues  

Southern Company s non-electric operating revenues from these other businesses decreased $26
million in 2009 primarily as a result of a $25 million decrease in revenues at SouthernLINC
Wireless related to lower average revenue per subscriber and fewer subscribers due to increased
competition in the industry. The $86 million decrease in 2008 primarily resulted from a $60
million decrease associated with Southern Company terminating its investment in synthetic fuel
projects at December 31, 2007 and a $21 million decrease in revenues at SouthernLINC Wireless
related to lower average revenue per subscriber and fewer subscribers due to

increased competition in the industry. Also contributing to the 2008 decrease was a $5 million
decrease in revenues from Southern Company s energy-related services business. The $55 million
decrease in 2007 primarily resulted from a $14 million decrease in fuel procurement service
revenues following a contract termination, a $13 million decrease in revenues at SouthernLINC
Wireless related to lower average revenue per subscriber and fewer subscribers due to increased
competition in the industry, and an $11 million decrease in revenues from Southern Company s
energy-related services business.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses  

Other operations and maintenance expenses for these other businesses decreased $40 million in 2009
primarily as a result of a $15 million decrease in salary and wages, advertising, equipment, and
network costs at SouthernLINC Wireless; a $10 million decrease in expenses associated with
leveraged lease litigation costs; and a $6 million decrease in parent company expenses associated
with the MC Asset Recovery litigation. Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $44
million in 2008 primarily as a result of $11 million of lower coal expenses related to Southern
Company terminating its investment in synthetic fuel projects at December 31, 2007; $9 million of
lower sales expenses at SouthernLINC Wireless related to lower sales volume; and $5 million of
lower parent company expenses related to advertising, litigation, and property insurance costs.
Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $29 million in 2007 primarily as a result of
$11 million of lower production expenses related to the termination of Southern Company s
membership interest in one of the synthetic fuel entities and $8 million attributed to the
wind-down of one of the Company s energy-related services businesses.

MC Asset Recovery Litigation Settlement  

On March 31, 2009, Southern Company entered into a litigation settlement agreement with MC Asset
Recovery which resulted in a charge of $202 million and requires MC Asset Recovery to release
Southern Company and certain other designated avoidance actions assigned to MC Asset Recovery in
connection with Mirant s plan of reorganization, as well as to release all actions against current
or former officers and directors of Mirant and Southern Company that have or could have been filed.
Pursuant to the settlement, Southern Company recorded a charge in the first quarter 2009 of $202
million, which was paid in the second quarter 2009. The settlement has been completed and resolves
all claims by MC Asset Recovery against Southern Company. On June 29, 2009, the case was dismissed
with prejudice.

Equity in Income (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries  

Southern Company made investments in two synthetic fuel production facilities that generated
operating losses. These investments allowed Southern Company to claim federal income tax credits
that offset these operating losses and made the projects profitable. Equity in income (losses) of
unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased $11 million in 2009 as a result of an $11 million gain
recognized in 2008 related to the dissolution of a partnership that was associated with these
synthetic fuel production facilities. Equity in income (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries
increased $35 million in 2008 primarily as a result of Southern Company terminating its investment
in synthetic fuel projects at December 31, 2007. Equity in income (losses) of unconsolidated
subsidiaries increased $35 million in 2007 primarily as a result of terminating Southern Company s
membership interest in one of the synthetic fuel entities which reduced the amount of the Company s
share of the losses and, therefore, the funding obligation for the year. Also contributing to the
2007 decrease were adjustments to the phase-out of the related federal income tax credits,
partially offset by higher operating expenses due to idled production in 2006 and decreased
production in 2007 in anticipation of exiting the business.

Leveraged Lease Income (Losses)  

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements which relate to international and domestic
energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal
income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt
related to these investments. Leveraged lease income (losses) increased $125 million in 2009
primarily as a result of the application in 2008 of certain accounting standards related to
leveraged leases, as well as a $26 million gain recorded in the second quarter 2009 associated with
the early termination of two international leveraged lease investments. The proceeds from the
termination were required to be used to extinguish all debt related to leveraged lease investments,
a portion of which had make-whole redemption provisions. This resulted in a $17 million loss and
partially offset the 2009 increase. Leveraged lease income (losses) decreased $125 million in 2008
as a result of Southern Company s decision to participate in a settlement with the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) related to deductions for several sale-in-lease-out transactions and the resulting
application of certain accounting standards related to leveraged leases. Leveraged lease income
(losses) decreased $29 million in 2007 as a result of the adoption of certain accounting standards
related to leveraged leases, as well as an expected decline in leveraged lease income over the
terms of the leases.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Other Income (Expense), Net  

The 2009 change in other income (expense), net for these other businesses when compared to the
prior year was not material. Other income (expense), net decreased $31 million in 2008 primarily
as a result of the 2007 gain on a derivative transaction in the synthetic fuel business which
settled on December 31, 2007. Other income (expense), net increased $74 million in 2007 primarily
as a result of a $60 million increase related to changes in the value of derivative transactions in
the synthetic fuel business and a $16 million increase related to the 2006 impairment of
investments in the synthetic fuel entities, partially offset by the release of $6 million in
certain contractual obligations associated with these investments in 2006.

Interest Expense  

Total interest charges and other financing costs for these other businesses decreased $22 million
in 2009 primarily as a result of $26 million associated with lower average interest rates on
existing variable rate debt and a $2 million decrease attributed to other interest charges. The
2009 decrease was partially offset by a $4 million increase associated with $63 million in
additional debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. Total interest
charges and other financing costs decreased $30 million in 2008 primarily as a result of
$29 million associated with lower average interest rates on existing variable rate debt and a $4
million decrease attributed to lower interest rates associated with new debt issued to replace
maturing securities. At December 31, 2008, these other businesses had $92 million in additional
debt outstanding compared to December 31, 2007. The 2008 decrease was partially offset by a $5
million increase in other interest costs. Total interest charges and other financing costs
decreased by $26 million in 2007 primarily as a result of $16 million of losses on debt that was
reacquired in 2006. Also contributing to the 2007 decrease was $97 million less debt outstanding
at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, lower interest rates associated with the
issuance of new long-term debt, and a $4 million decrease in other interest costs.

Income Taxes  

Income taxes for these other businesses increased $30 million in 2009 excluding the effects of the
$202 million charge resulting from the litigation settlement with MC Asset Recovery in the first
quarter 2009. The 2009 increase was primarily due to the application in 2008 of certain accounting
standards related to leveraged leases and income taxes. Partially offsetting this increase was
lower tax expense associated with the early termination of two international leveraged lease
investments and the extinguishment of the associated debt discussed previously under  Leveraged
Lease Income (Losses).  Income taxes decreased $7 million in 2008 primarily as a result of
leveraged lease losses discussed previously under  Leveraged Lease Income (Losses),  partially
offset by a $36 million decrease in net synthetic fuel tax credits as a result of Southern Company
terminating its investment in synthetic fuel projects at December 31, 2007. Income taxes increased
$53 million in 2007 primarily as a result of a $30 million decrease in net synthetic fuel tax
credits as a result of terminating Southern Company s membership interest in one of the synthetic
fuel entities in 2006 and increasing the synthetic fuel tax credit reserves due to an anticipated
phase-out of synthetic fuel tax credits due to higher oil prices. See Note 5 to the financial
statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for further information.

Effects of Inflation 

The traditional operating companies are subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the
recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss
since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Southern Power is
party to long-term contracts reflecting market-based rates, including inflation expectations. Any
adverse effect of inflation on Southern Company s results of operations has not been substantial.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 

General 

The four traditional operating companies operate as vertically integrated utilities providing
electricity to customers within their service areas in the Southeastern United States. Prices for
electricity provided to retail customers are set by state PSCs under cost-based regulatory
principles. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the
exchange of electric power are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations.
Southern Power continues to focus on long-term capacity contracts, optimized by limited energy
trading activities. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates   Electric Utility Regulation  herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information about regulatory matters.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of Southern Company s future earnings depends on numerous factors
that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company s primary business of
selling electricity. These factors include the traditional operating companies  ability to
maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the recovery of
prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing costs. Other major factors include the
profitability of the competitive wholesale supply business and federal regulatory policy which may
impact Southern Company s level of participation in this market. Southern Company continues to
face regulatory challenges related to transmission issues at the national level. Future earnings
for the electricity business in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy
contracts with neighboring utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced
by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic
growth or decline in the service area. In addition, the level of future earnings for the wholesale
supply business also depends on numerous factors including creditworthiness of customers, total
generating capacity available in the Southeast, future acquisitions and construction of generating
facilities, and the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire. Recessionary
conditions have negatively impacted sales for the traditional operating companies, particularly to
industrial and commercial customers, and have negatively impacted wholesale capacity revenues at
Southern Power. The timing and extent of the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

Southern Company system generating capacity increased 325 megawatts due to Southern Power s
acquisition of West Georgia Generating Company, LLC and divestiture of DeSoto County Generating
Company, LLC in December 2009. In general, Southern Company has constructed or acquired new
generating capacity only after entering into long-term capacity contracts for the new facilities or
to meet requirements of Southern Company s regulated retail markets, both of which are optimized by
limited energy trading activities. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Construction Program  herein
and Note 7 to the financial statements for additional information.

As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to
evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include
business combinations, partnerships, acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses
or properties, disposition of certain assets, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof.
Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and
regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any
combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial
condition of Southern Company.

Environmental Matters 

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Environmental Matters  for additional
information.

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New
Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired
generating facilities. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action, the EPA filed a
separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight
coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, including facilities
co-owned by Mississippi Power and Gulf Power. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The EPA concurrently issued notices of violation to Gulf Power and Mississippi
Power relating to Gulf Power s Plant Crist and Mississippi Power s Plant Watson. In early 2000,
the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add Gulf Power and Mississippi Power as defendants
based on the allegations in the notices of violation. However, in March 2001, the court denied the
motion based on lack of jurisdiction, and the EPA has not re-filed. The original action, now
solely against Georgia Power, has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the
case has not been reopened.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

Southern Company believes that the traditional operating companies complied with applicable laws
and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.
The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to

II-23 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

assert their nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the
political question doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but the
traditional operating companies and Southern Power were named as defendants in an amended complaint
which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations  

General 

The electric utilities  operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal
environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media,
including air, water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean
Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning   Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2009, the electric utilities had invested approximately $7.5 billion in capital projects to
comply with these requirements, with annual totals of $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion
for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $545 million, $721
million, and $1.2 billion for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The Company s compliance
strategy can be affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations; the
cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; and the Company s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY    Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations  herein.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and
health concerns could also significantly affect Southern Company. Although new or revised
environmental legislation or regulations could affect many areas of Southern Company s operations,
the full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality 

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for Southern Company. Through 2009, the electric utilities have spent
approximately $6.6 billion in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide
(NO x ) emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional
controls are currently being installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain
compliance with existing regulations, and meet new requirements.

The EPA regulates ground level ozone through implementation of an eight-hour ozone air quality
standard. A 20-county area within metropolitan Atlanta is the only location within Southern
Company s service area that is currently designated as nonattainment for the standard, which could
require additional reductions in NO x  emissions from power plants. In March 2008,
however, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a more stringent eight-hour ozone standard, and
on January 6, 2010, the EPA proposed further reductions in the standard. The EPA is expected to
finalize the revised standard in August 2010 and require state implementation plans for any
nonattainment areas by December 2013. The revised eight-hour ozone standard is expected to result
in designation of new nonattainment areas within Southern Company s service territory.

During 2005, the EPA s annual fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within Southern Company s service area in Alabama and Georgia. State plans for
addressing the nonattainment designations for this standard could require further reductions in
SO 2  and NO x  emissions from power plants. In September 2006, the EPA
published a final rule which increased the stringency of the 24-hour average fine particulate
matter air quality standard. The Birmingham, Alabama area has been designated as nonattainment for
the 24-hour standard, and a state implementation plan for this nonattainment area is due in
December 2012.

On December 8, 2009, the EPA also proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard
for SO 2 . The EPA is expected to finalize the revised SO 2  standard in June
2010.

Twenty-eight eastern states, including each of the states within Southern Company s service area,
are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The rule calls for
additional reductions of NO x  and/or SO 2  to be achieved in two phases,
2009/2010 and 2015. In July 2008 and December 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit issued

II-24 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

decisions invalidating certain aspects of CAIR, but left CAIR compliance requirements in place
while the EPA develops a revised rule. States in the Southern Company service territory have
completed plans to implement CAIR, and emissions reductions are being accomplished by the
installation of emissions controls at coal-fired facilities of the electric utilities and/or by the
purchase of emissions allowances. The EPA is expected to issue a proposed CAIR replacement rule in
July 2010.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule was finalized in July 2005, with a goal of restoring natural
visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064.
The rule involves the application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources
built between 1962 and 1977, and any additional emissions reductions necessary for each designated
area to achieve reasonable progress toward the natural conditions goal by 2018 and for each
ten-year period thereafter. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to
determine that CAIR satisfies BART requirements for SO 2  and NO x , and no
additional controls beyond CAIR are anticipated to be necessary at any of the traditional operating
companies  facilities. States have completed or are currently completing implementation plans for
BART compliance and other measures required to achieve the first phase of reasonable progress.

The EPA is currently developing a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule for coal and
oil-fired electric generating units, which will likely address numerous Hazardous Air Pollutants,
including mercury. In March 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), a cap and
trade program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. In February
2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the CAMR. In a
separate proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the EPA entered into a
proposed consent decree that requires the EPA to issue a proposed MACT rule by March 16, 2011 and a
final rule by November 16, 2011.

In February 2004, the EPA finalized the Industrial Boiler (IB) MACT rule, which imposed limits on
hazardous air pollutants from industrial boilers, including biomass boilers. Compliance with the
final rule was scheduled to begin in September 2007; however, in response to challenges to the
final rule, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the IB MACT rule
in its entirety in July 2007 and ordered the EPA to develop a new IB MACT rule. In September 2009,
the deadline to promulgate a proposed rule was extended from July 15, 2009 to April 15, 2010, with
a final rule required by December 16, 2010. The EPA is currently developing the new rule and may
change the methodology to determine the MACT limits for industrial boilers.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standards, the fine particulate matter nonattainment
designations, and future revisions to CAIR, the SO 2  standard, the Clean Air Visibility
Rule, and the MACT rules for electric generating units and industrial boilers on the Company cannot
be determined at this time and will depend on the specific provisions of the final rules,
resolution of any legal challenges, and the development and implementation of rules at the state
level. However, these additional regulations could result in significant additional compliance
costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations,
cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company has already installed a number of SO 2
 and NO x  emissions controls and plans to install additional controls within the
next several years to ensure continued compliance with applicable air quality requirements. In
addition, most units in Georgia are required to install specific emissions controls according to a
schedule set forth in the state s Multipollutant Rule, which is designed to reduce emissions of
SO 2 , NO x , and mercury in Georgia.

Water Quality 

In July 2004, the EPA published final regulations under the Clean Water Act to reduce impingement
and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
water intake structures. The use of cost-benefit analysis in the rule was ultimately appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 1, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA could consider
costs in arriving at its standards and in providing variances from those standards for existing
intake structures. The EPA is now in the process of revising the regulations. While the U.S.
Supreme Court s decision may ultimately result in greater flexibility for demonstrating compliance
with the standards, the full scope of the regulations will depend on further rulemaking by the EPA
and the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

On December 28, 2009, the EPA announced its determination that revision of the current effluent
guidelines for steam electric power plants is warranted and proposed a plan to adopt such revisions
by 2013. New wastewater treatment requirements are expected and may result in the installation of
additional controls on certain Southern Company system facilities. The impact of revised
guidelines will depend on the studies conducted in connection with the rulemaking, as well as the
specific requirements of the final rule, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Environmental Remediation 

Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the traditional operating companies could incur substantial costs to clean up
properties. The traditional operating companies conduct studies to determine the extent of any
required cleanup and have recognized in their respective financial statements the costs to clean up
known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year
presented. The traditional operating companies may be liable for some or all required cleanup
costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Environmental Matters   Environmental Remediation  for additional information.

Coal Combustion Byproducts 

The EPA is currently evaluating whether additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts is
merited under federal solid and hazardous waste laws. The EPA has collected information from the
electric utility industry on surface impoundment safety and conducted on-site inspections at three
facilities of Alabama Power and Georgia Power as part of its evaluation. The traditional operating
companies have a routine and robust inspection program in place to ensure the integrity of their
respective coal ash surface impoundments. The EPA is expected to issue a proposal regarding
additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts in early 2010. The impact of these additional
regulations on the Company will depend on the specific provisions of the final rule and cannot be
determined at this time. However, additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts could have a
significant impact on the traditional operating companies  management, beneficial use, and disposal
of such byproducts and could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect
future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and
financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Global Climate Issues  

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions, renewable energy standards, and energy efficiency standards continue to be considered in
Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by
the current Administration. On June 26, 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009
(ACES), which would impose mandatory greenhouse gas restrictions through implementation of a cap
and trade program, a renewable energy standard, and other measures, was passed by the House of
Representatives. ACES would require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions on a national basis to
a level that is 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, and 83% below 2005
levels by 2050. In addition, ACES would provide for renewable energy standards of 6% by 2012 and
20% by 2020. Similar legislation is being considered by the Senate. The financial and operational
impact of such legislation, if enacted, will depend on a variety of factors. These factors include
the specific greenhouse gas emissions limits or renewable energy requirements, the timing of
implementation of these limits or requirements, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the
level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and
commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions,
the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any),
the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and cost recovery through regulated rates. There can be
no assurance that any legislation will be enacted or as to the ultimate form of any legislation.
Additional or alternative legislation may be adopted as well.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published
a final determination, which became effective on January 14, 2010, that certain greenhouse gas
emissions from new motor vehicles endanger public health and welfare due to climate change. On
September 28, 2009, the EPA published a proposed rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from new
motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has stated that once this rule is effective, it
will cause carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to become regulated pollutants under the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) preconstruction permit program and the Title V
operating permit program, which both apply to power plants. As a result, the construction of new
facilities or the major modification of existing facilities could trigger the requirement for a PSD
permit and the installation of the best available control technology for carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases. The EPA also published a proposed rule governing how these programs would be
applied to stationary sources, including power plants, on October 27, 2009. The EPA has stated
that it expects to finalize these proposed rules in March 2010. The ultimate outcome of the
endangerment finding and these proposed rules cannot be determined at this time and will depend on
additional regulatory action and any legal challenges.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. A nonbinding agreement was announced during the most recent round of
negotiations in December 2009 that included a pledge from both developed and developing countries
to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome and impact of the international negotiations
cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Although the outcome of federal, state, or international initiatives cannot be determined at this
time, mandatory restrictions on the Company s greenhouse gas emissions or requirements relating to
renewable energy or energy efficiency on the federal or state level are likely to result in
significant additional compliance costs, including significant capital expenditures. These costs
could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions, and could result in the retirement
of a significant number of coal-fired generating units. See Item 1   BUSINESS    Rate Matters  
Integrated Resource Planning  for additional information. Also, additional compliance costs and
costs related to unit retirements could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Further, higher costs that are
recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could
negatively impact results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In 2008, the total carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel-fired electric generating units
owned by the electric utilities were approximately 142 million metric tons. The preliminary estimate of
carbon dioxide emissions from these units in 2009 is approximately 121 million metric tons. The
level of carbon dioxide emissions from year to year will be dependent on the level of generation
and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed,
and the availability of generating units.

The Company is actively evaluating and developing electric generating technologies with lower
greenhouse gas emissions. These include new nuclear generation, including two additional
generating units at Plant Vogtle in Georgia; proposed construction of an advanced IGCC unit with
approximately 65% carbon capture in Kemper County, Mississippi; and renewables investments,
including the construction of a biomass plant in Sacul, Texas. The Company is currently
considering additional projects and is pursuing research into the costs and viability of other
renewable technologies for the Southeast.

PSC Matters 

Alabama Power  

Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar
year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4% per year
and any annual adjustment is limited to 5%. Retail rates remain unchanged when the retail return
on common equity (ROE) is projected to be between 13% and 14.5%. If Alabama Power s actual retail
ROE is above the allowed equity return range, customer refunds will be required; however, there is
no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail ROE fall below the allowed
equity return range.

On December 1, 2009, Alabama Power made its Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected
data for calendar year 2010. The Rate RSE increase for 2010 is 3.2%, or $152 million annually, and
was effective in January 2010. The revenue adjustment under the Rate RSE is largely attributable
to the costs associated with fossil capacity which is currently dedicated to certain long-term
wholesale contracts that expire during 2010. Retail cost of service for 2010 reflects the cost for
that portion of the year in which this capacity is no longer committed to wholesale. The
termination of these long-term wholesale contracts will result in a significant decrease in unit
power sales capacity revenues. In an Alabama PSC order dated January 5, 2010, the Alabama PSC
acknowledged that a full calendar year of costs for such capacity would be reflected in the Rate
RSE calculation beginning in 2011 and thereafter. Under the terms of Rate RSE, the maximum
increase for 2011 cannot exceed 4.76%.

The Alabama PSC has also approved a rate mechanism that provides for adjustments to recognize the
cost of placing new generating facilities in retail service and for the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated PPAs under a Rate Certificated New Plant (Rate CNP). There was no
adjustment to Rate CNP in April 2007, 2008, or 2009. Effective April 2010, Rate CNP will be
reduced approximately $70 million annually, primarily due to the expiration on May 31, 2010 of the
PPA with Southern Power covering the capacity of Plant Harris Unit 1. Rate CNP also allows for the
recovery of Alabama Power s retail costs associated with environmental laws, regulations, or other
such mandates. The rate mechanism is based on forward-looking information and provides for the
recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated annually. Environmental costs to
be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on invested
capital.

On December 1, 2009, Alabama Power made its Rate CNP environmental submission to the Alabama PSC of
projected data for calendar year 2010. The Rate CNP environmental increase for 2010 is 4.3%, or
$195 million annually, based upon projected billings. Under the terms of the rate mechanism, the
adjustment became effective in January 2010. The Rate CNP environmental adjustment is primarily
attributable to scrubbers being placed in service during 2010 at four of Alabama Power s generating
plants. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Alabama Power  
Retail Rate Plans  for further information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Georgia Power  

In December 2007, the Georgia PSC approved the 2007 Retail Rate Plan. Under the 2007 Retail Rate
Plan, Georgia Power s earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%.
Retail base rates increased by approximately $100 million effective January 1, 2008 to provide for
cost recovery of transmission, distribution, generation, and other investments, as well as
increased operating costs. In addition, the ECCR tariff was implemented to allow for the recovery
of costs related to environmental projects mandated by state and federal regulations. The ECCR
tariff increased rates by approximately $222 million effective January 1, 2008.

In connection with the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power agreed that it would not file for a
general base rate increase during this period unless its projected retail ROE falls below 10.25%.
The economic recession has significantly reduced Georgia Power s revenues upon which retail rates
were set under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan. In June 2009, despite stringent efforts to reduce
expenses, Georgia Power s projected retail ROE for both 2009 and 2010 was below 10.25%. However,
in lieu of filing to increase customer rates as allowed under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, on June
29, 2009, Georgia Power filed a request with the Georgia PSC for an accounting order that would
allow Georgia Power to amortize up to $324 million of its regulatory liability related to other
cost of removal obligations.

On August 27, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved the accounting order. Under the terms of the
accounting order, Georgia Power was entitled to amortize up to one-third of the regulatory
liability ($108 million) in 2009, limited to the amount needed to earn no more than a 9.75% retail
ROE. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Georgia Power amortized $41 million of the regulatory
liability. In addition, Georgia Power may amortize up to two-thirds of the regulatory liability
($216 million) in 2010, limited to the amount needed to earn no more than a 10.15% retail ROE.
Georgia Power is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, in response to which the
Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan should be continued,
modified, or discontinued. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters
  Georgia Power   Retail Rate Plans  for additional information.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The traditional operating companies each have established fuel cost recovery rates approved by
their respective state PSCs. In previous years, the traditional operating companies experienced
higher than expected fuel costs for coal, natural gas, and uranium. These higher fuel costs have
resulted in total under recovered fuel costs included in the balance sheets of Georgia Power and
Gulf Power of approximately $667 million at December 31, 2009. During the third quarter 2009,
Alabama Power and Mississippi Power collected all previously under recovered fuel costs and, as of
December 31, 2009, have a total over recovered fuel balance of $229 million. The total under
recovered fuel costs included in the balance sheets of the traditional operating companies at
December 31, 2008 was $1.2 billion. The traditional operating companies continuously monitor the
under or over recovered fuel cost balances.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changing the
billing factor has no significant effect on the Company s revenues or net income, but does impact
annual cash flow. See Note 1 to the financial statements under  Revenues  and Note 3 to the
financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Alabama Power   Fuel Cost Recovery  and
 Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Fuel Cost Recovery  for additional information.

Legislation 

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives, which could have a significant impact on the future cash flow
and net income of Southern Company. Southern Company s cash flow reduction to 2009 tax payments as
a result of the bonus depreciation provisions of the ARRA was approximately $250 million. On
December 8, 2009, President Obama announced proposals to accelerate job growth that include an
extension of the bonus depreciation provision for the ARRA for 2010, which could have a significant
impact on the future cash flow and net income of Southern Company.

On October 27, 2009, Southern Company and its subsidiaries received notice that an award of $165
million had been granted under the ARRA grant application for transmission and distribution
automation and modernization projects pending final negotiations. Southern Company continues to
assess the other financial implications of the ARRA.

The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have passed separate bills related to
healthcare reform. Both bills include a provision that would make Medicare Part D subsidy
reimbursements taxable. If enacted into law, this provision could have a

II-28 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

significant negative impact on Southern Company s net income. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under  Other Postretirement Benefits  for additional information.

The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Income Tax Matters 

Georgia State Income Tax Credits  

Georgia Power s 2005 through 2008 income tax filings for the State of Georgia include state income
tax credits for increased activity through Georgia ports. Georgia Power has also filed similar
claims for the years 2002 through 2004. The Georgia Department of Revenue has not responded to
these claims. In July 2007, Georgia Power filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County
to recover the credits claimed for the years 2002 through 2004. An unrecognized tax benefit has
been recorded related to these credits. See Note 5 to the financial statements under  Unrecognized
Tax Benefits  for additional information. If Georgia Power prevails, these claims could have a
significant, and possibly material, positive effect on Southern Company s net income. If Georgia
Power is not successful, payment of the related state tax could have a significant, and possibly
material, negative effect on Southern Company s cash flow. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot now be determined.

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction  

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production activities net income. The
percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years
2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. See
Note 5 to the financial statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for additional information.

Construction Program 

The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs to
accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. Southern Company
intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new generating facilities,
including units at Southern Power, proposed new nuclear units, and a proposed IGCC facility, as
well as adding environmental control equipment and expanding the transmission and distribution
systems. For the traditional operating companies, major generation construction projects are
subject to state PSC approvals in order to be included in retail rates. While Southern Power
generally constructs and acquires generation assets covered by long-term PPAs, any uncontracted
capacity could negatively affect future earnings. See Note 7 to the financial statements under
 Construction Program  for estimated construction expenditures for the next three years. In
addition, see Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power  
Nuclear Construction  and  Retail Regulatory Matters   Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle 
for additional information.

Other Matters 

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other matters being litigated,
regulatory matters, and certain tax-related issues that could affect future earnings. In addition,
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. The business activities of Southern Company s subsidiaries are
subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as
regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims
of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen
enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has
increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury and other claims
for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law nuisance claims for
injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against
Southern Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current
proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities,
if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Southern
Company s financial statements. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Southern Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described
in Note 1 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are
made that may have a material impact on Southern Company s results of operations and related
disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly
different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates described below with
the Audit Committee of Southern Company s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation  

Southern Company s traditional operating companies, which comprised approximately 97% of Southern
Company s total operating revenues for 2009, are subject to retail regulation by their respective
state PSCs and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the
traditional operating companies are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a
result, the traditional operating companies apply accounting standards which require the financial
statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the
regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would
be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses
and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates
or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory
liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on the Company s
financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking
process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional operating
companies; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation,
nuclear decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on
the Company s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities
have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and
liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could
materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact
the Company s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations  

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of federal and state laws and
regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that potentially subject them to
environmental, litigation, income tax, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and
Note 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies.
Southern Company periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and, in accordance with GAAP,
records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and
reasonably estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external
events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could
materially affect Southern Company s financial statements.

These events or conditions include the following:

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. 

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in IRS or state revenue department
interpretations of existing regulations. 

Identification of additional sites that require environmental remediation or the filing of
other complaints in which Southern Company or its subsidiaries may be asserted to be a
potentially responsible party. 

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or complaints in which Southern
Company or its subsidiaries may be named as a defendant. 

Resolution or progression of new or existing matters through the legislative process, the
court systems, the IRS, state revenue departments, the FERC, or the EPA.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Unbilled Revenues  

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be unpredictable
and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could
be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company s results of
operations.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

Southern Company s calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on
a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates,
expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and
other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest
and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan
assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ
from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore,
generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the
Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefits costs
and obligations.

Key elements in determining Southern Company s pension and other postretirement benefit expense in
accordance with GAAP are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to
measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The
expected long-term return on postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company s
investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that
considers external actuarial advice.

Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of
expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company s target asset allocation. Southern
Company discounts the future cash flows related to its postretirement benefit plans using a
single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high
quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in Southern Company s long-term
assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed
discount rate:

New Accounting Standards 

Variable Interest Entities  

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on the consolidation of
variable interest entities, which replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for
determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an
approach that is primarily qualitative, requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requires additional disclosures about an
enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities. Southern Company adopted this new guidance
effective January 1, 2010, with no material impact on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

Overview 

Southern Company s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2009. Throughout the
turmoil in the financial markets, Southern Company has maintained adequate access to capital
without drawing on any of its committed bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial
paper programs and variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. Southern Company intends to
continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank
credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. Market rates for committed credit
have increased, and Southern Company and its subsidiaries have been and expect to continue to be
subject to higher costs as existing facilities are replaced or renewed. Total committed credit
fees for Southern Company and its subsidiaries currently average less than   1  / 2  of 1% per year. See
 Sources of Capital  and  Financing Activities  herein for additional information.

Southern Company s investments in pension and nuclear decommissioning trust funds remained stable
in value as of December 31, 2009. Southern Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to
be contributed to the pension trust fund is 2012 and such contribution could be significant;
however, projections of the amount vary significantly depending on key variables including future
trust fund performance and cannot be determined at this time. Southern Company does not expect any
changes to funding obligations to the nuclear decommissioning trusts prior to 2011.

Net cash
provided from operating activities in 2009 totaled $3.3 billion,
a decrease of $201
million from the corresponding period in 2008. Significant changes in operating cash flow for 2009
as compared to the corresponding period in 2008 include a reduction to net income as previously
discussed, increased levels of coal inventory, and increased cash outflows for tax payments. These
uses of funds were partially offset by increased cash inflows as a result of higher fuel cost
recovery rates included in customer billings. Net cash provided from operating activities in 2008
totaled $3.5 billion, an increase of $30 million as compared to 2007. Significant changes in
operating cash flow for 2008 included a $264 million increase in the use of funds for fossil fuel
inventory as compared to the corresponding period in 2007. This use of funds was offset by an
increase in cash of $312 million in accrued taxes primarily due to a difference between the periods
in payments for federal taxes and property taxes. Net cash provided from operating activities in
2007 totaled $3.4 billion, an increase of $583 million as compared to the corresponding period in
2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income as previously discussed, an
increase in cash collections from previously deferred fuel and storm damage costs, and a reduction
in cash outflows compared to the previous year in fossil fuel inventory.

Net cash used for investing activities in 2009 totaled $4.3 billion primarily due to property
additions to utility plant of $4.7 billion, partially offset by approximately $340 million in cash
received from the early termination of two leveraged lease investments. Net cash used for
investing activities in 2008 totaled $4.1 billion primarily due to property additions to utility
plant of $4.0 billion. In 2007, net cash used for investing activities was $3.7 billion primarily
due to property additions to utility plant of $3.5 billion.

Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2009 primarily due to the
issuance of new long-term debt and common stock issuances, partially offset by cash outflows for
repayments of long-term debt and dividend payments. Net cash provided from financing activities
totaled $878 million in 2008 primarily due to long-term debt issuances. Net cash provided from
financing activities totaled $309 million in 2007 primarily due to replacement of short-term debt
with longer term financing and cash raised from common stock programs.

Significant
balance sheet changes in 2009 include an increase of $3.4 billion in total property,
plant, and equipment for the installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and
construction of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Other

II-32 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

significant changes include an increase in long-term debt, excluding amounts due within one year,
of $1.3 billion used primarily for construction expenditures and general corporate purposes and
$1.6 billion of additional equity.

At the end of 2009, the closing price of Southern Company s common stock was $33.32 per share,
compared with book value of $18.15 per share. The market-to-book value ratio was 184% at the end
of 2009, compared with 217% at year-end 2008.

Southern Company, each of the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power have received
investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with respect to debt, preferred
securities, preferred stock, and/or preference stock. Southern Company Services, Inc. has an
investment grade corporate credit rating. See  Credit Rating Risk  herein for additional
information.

Sources of Capital 

Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through internal cash flow and external
security issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of the Company s stock
plans, private placements, or public offerings. The amount and timing of additional equity capital
to be raised in 2010, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on Southern Company s
investment opportunities.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power plan to obtain the funds required for
construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were
primarily from operating cash flows, security issuances, term loans, short-term borrowings, and
equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the type and timing of any financings, if
needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. In
addition, on February 16, 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) offered Georgia Power a
conditional commitment for federal loan guarantees that would apply to future Georgia Power
borrowings related to two additional nuclear units on the site of Plant Vogtle (Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4). Any borrowings guaranteed by the DOE would be full recourse to Georgia Power and secured
by a first priority lien on Georgia Power s 45.7% undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4. Total guaranteed borrowings would not exceed 70% of eligible project costs, or
approximately $3.4 billion, and are expected to be funded by the Federal Financing Bank. Georgia
Power has 90 days to accept the conditional commitment, including obtaining any necessary
regulatory approvals. Georgia Power will work with the DOE to finalize loan guarantees. Final
approval and issuance of loan guarantees by the DOE are subject to receipt of the combined
construction and operating license for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC), negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE,
receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. There can be
no assurance that the DOE will issue loan guarantees for Georgia Power.

The issuance of securities by the traditional operating companies is generally subject to the
approval of the applicable state PSC. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and
Southern Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory
approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern
Company and certain of its subsidiaries file registration statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of
securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the amounts, if any,
registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to
ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Southern Company, each traditional operating company, and Southern Power obtain financing
separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
 Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information. The Southern Company system does not
maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled
with funds of any other company.

Southern Company s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued
use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs as well as scheduled maturities of
long-term debt. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Company has substantial
cash flow from operating activities and access to capital markets, including commercial paper
programs (which are backed by bank credit facilities).

At December 31, 2009, Southern Company and its subsidiaries had approximately $690 million of cash
and cash equivalents and $4.8 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, of which $1.5
billion expire in 2010, $25 million expire in 2011, and $3.2 billion expire in 2012. Approximately
$81 million of the credit facilities expiring in 2010 allow for the execution of term loans for an
additional two-year period, and $517 million allow for the execution of one-year term loans. Most
of these arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels and typically contain cross default
provisions that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Southern
Company and its subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all such covenants. A portion of the
unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the traditional operating

revenue bonds. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds requiring liquidity
support as of December 31, 2009 was approximately $1.6 billion. Subsequent to December 31, 2009,
two remarketings of pollution control revenue bonds increased that amount to $1.8 billion. See
Note 6 to the financial statements under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information.

Financing Activities 

During 2009, Southern Company issued $350 million of Series 2009A 4.15% Senior Notes due May 15,
2014 and $300 million of Series 2009B Floating Rate Senior Notes due October 21, 2011, and its
subsidiaries issued $1.8 billion of senior notes and incurred obligations of $625 million related
to the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds. A portion of the proceeds of the newly issued
pollution control revenue bonds were used to retire $327 million of outstanding pollution control
revenue bonds. Southern Company also issued 22.6 million shares of common stock for $673 million
through the Southern Investment Plan and employee and director stock plans. In addition, Southern
Company issued 19.9 million shares of common stock through at-the-market issuances pursuant to
sales agency agreements related to Southern Company s continuous equity offering program and
received cash proceeds of $613 million, net of $6 million in fees and commissions. The proceeds
were primarily used to redeem or repay at maturity $1.2 billion of long-term debt, to fund ongoing
construction projects, to repay short-term and long-term indebtedness, and for general corporate
purposes.

Also during 2009, Georgia Power and Gulf Power entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to
mitigate exposure to interest rate changes related to anticipated debt issuances. The notional
amounts of the swaps totaled $200 million and $100 million, respectively. Georgia Power had net
realized losses of $19 million upon termination of $300 million of interest rate hedges during
2009. The effective portion of these losses has been deferred in other comprehensive income and is
being amortized to interest expense over the life of the original interest rate hedge.

In 2009, Southern Company used a portion of the cash received from the early termination of two
leveraged lease investments to extinguish $253 million of debt which included all debt related to
these leveraged lease investments and to pay make-whole redemption premiums of $17 million
associated with such debt.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual
obligations, Southern Company and its subsidiaries plan to continue, when economically feasible, a
program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

In 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a combined cycle
generating facility built at Plant Daniel for approximately $370 million. In 2003, the generating
facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), a limited partnership whose investors are
unaffiliated with Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
agreement with Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties
unrelated to Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi Power comprise less than 50% of
Juniper s assets. Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related
liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease also provides
for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73% of the acquisition cost, by Mississippi Power
that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that Mississippi Power does not renew the
lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market value is less than the unamortized cost of
the assets. In April 2010, 18 months prior to the end of the initial lease term, Mississippi Power
may elect to renew for 10 years. See Note 7 to the financial statements under  Operating Leases 
for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk 

Southern Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in
payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain
contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit
rating change of certain subsidiaries to BBB and Baa2, or BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These
contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and
storage, emissions allowances, energy price risk management, and construction of new generation
facilities. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these
contracts at a BBB and Baa2 rating were approximately $9 million and at a BBB- and/or Baa3 rating
were approximately $467 million. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential collateral
requirements under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately $2.3
billion. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit,
or cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact Southern Company s ability to
access capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

On September 2, 2009, Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) affirmed the credit ratings of Southern
Company s senior unsecured notes and commercial paper of A3/P-1, respectively, and revised the
rating outlook for Southern Company to negative. On September 4, 2009, Fitch Ratings, Inc.
affirmed Southern Company s long-term and commercial paper credit ratings of A/F1, respectively,
and maintained its stable rating outlook. On October 6, 2009, Standard and Poor s Rating Services,
a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S P) affirmed the credit ratings of Southern
Company s senior unsecured notes and commercial paper of A-/A-1, respectively, and maintained a
stable rating outlook.

Market Price Risk 

Southern Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures, where
possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for
hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to a change in interest rates, the Company enters into forward starting
interest rate swaps and other derivatives that have been designated as hedges. Derivatives
outstanding at December 31, 2009 have a notional amount of $976 million and are related to
anticipated debt issuances and various floating rate obligations over the next year. The weighted
average interest rate on $2.7 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure that has not
been hedged at January 1, 2010 was 0.76%. If Southern Company sustained a 100 basis point change
in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized
interest expense by approximately $27 million at January 1, 2010. For further information, see
Note 1 to the financial statements under  Financial Instruments  and Note 11 to the financial
statements.

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the traditional operating companies continue to have limited
exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
In addition, Southern Power s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
responsibility to the purchaser. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed
to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of sales of uncontracted
generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
traditional operating companies enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into financial
hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. The traditional operating companies continue to manage
fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

(a) 
       
     Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new
contracts entered into during the period, if any. 

The change in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the year
ended December 31, 2009 was an increase of $107 million, substantially all of which is due to
natural gas positions. The change is attributable to both the volume of million British thermal
units (mmBtu) and prices of natural gas. At December 31, 2009, Southern Company had a net hedge
volume of 154 million mmBtu (includes location basis of 2 million mmBtu) with a weighted average
contract cost approximately $1.17 per mmBtu above market prices, compared to 149 million mmBtu
(includes location basis of 2 million mmBtu) at December 31, 2008 with a weighted average contract
cost approximately $1.97 per mmBtu above market prices. The majority of the natural gas hedges are
recorded through the traditional operating companies  fuel cost recovery clauses.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge designation was
reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate to the
traditional operating companies  fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially
recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense
as they are recovered through the fuel cost recovery clauses. Gains and losses on energy-related
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are mainly used by Southern Power to hedge anticipated
purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other comprehensive income before being
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on
energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are
recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Total net unrealized pre-tax gains (losses) recognized in the statements of income for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 for energy-related derivative contracts that are not hedges
were $(5) million, $1 million, and $3 million, respectively.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy
in which they fall at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

Southern Company uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued
using prices which are actively quoted, and thus fall into Level 2. See Note 10 to the financial
statements for further discussion on fair value measurement.

Southern Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties
to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. Southern Company only enters into
agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings
by Moody s and S P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit
exposure. Therefore, Southern Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance
by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
 Financial Instruments  and Note 11 to the financial statements.

Southern Company performs periodic reviews of its leveraged lease transactions, both domestic and
international and the creditworthiness of the lessees, including a review of the value of the
underlying leased assets and the credit ratings of the lessees. Southern Company s domestic lease
transactions generally do not have any credit enhancement mechanisms; however, the lessees in its
international lease transactions have pledged various deposits as additional security to secure the
obligations. The lessees in the Company s international lease transactions are also required to
provide additional collateral in the event of a credit downgrade below a certain level.

During 2007, Southern Company had derivatives in place to reduce its exposure to a phase-out of
certain income tax credits related to synthetic fuel production in 2007. In accordance with
Internal Revenue Code Section 45K, these tax credits were subject to limitation as the annual
average price of oil increased. Because these transactions were not designated as hedges, the
gains and losses were recognized in the statements of income as incurred. These derivatives
settled on January 1, 2008 and thus there was no income statement impact for the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2009. For 2007, the unrealized fair value gain recognized in other income to
mark the transactions to market was $27 million.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 

The construction program of Southern Company is currently estimated to be $4.9 billion for 2010,
$5.3 billion for 2011, and $6.2 billion for 2012. These estimates include costs for new generation
construction. Environmental expenditures included in these estimated amounts are $545 million,
$721 million, and $1.2 billion for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The construction programs
are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these
estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear
plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; PSC approvals;
changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials;
project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance
that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Nuclear Construction  and  Retail
Regulatory Matters   Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  and Note 7 to the financial
statements under  Construction Program  for additional information.

As a result of NRC requirements, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds for
nuclear decommissioning costs; however, Alabama Power currently has no additional funding
requirements. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under  Nuclear
Decommissioning. 

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Southern Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the traditional operating companies  respective regulatory commissions.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred and preference stock
dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, 7, and 11 to the
financial statements for additional information.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Contractual Obligations 

(a) 
       
     All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. Southern Company and its
subsidiaries plan to continue to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations
with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are
estimated based on rates as of January 1, 2010, as reflected in the statements of
capitalization. Fixed rates include, where applicable, the effects of interest rate
derivatives employed to manage interest rate risk. Excludes capital lease amounts (shown
separately). 

(b) 
       
     Preferred and preference stock do not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next
five years only. 

(c) 
       
     For additional information, see Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements. 

(d) 
       
     The timing related to the realization of $36 million in unrecognized tax benefits and
interest payments in individual years beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably and reliably
estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions.
See Notes 3 and 5 to the financial statements for additional information. 

(e) 
       
     Southern Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other
operations and maintenance expenditures. Total other operations and maintenance expenses for
2009, 2008, and 2007 were $3.5 billion, $3.8 billion, and $3.7 billion, respectively. 

(f) 
       
     Southern Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent
current estimates of total expenditures excluding those amounts related to contractual
purchase commitments for nuclear fuel. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase commitments
were outstanding in connection with the construction program. 

(g) 
       
     As part of Southern Company s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal
plants, the traditional operating companies have entered into various long-term commitments
for the procurement of limestone to be used in flue gas desulfurization equipment. 

(h) 
       
     Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery.
Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices
at December 31, 2009. 

(i) 
       
     Biomass fuel commitments are based on minimum committed tonnage of wood waste purchases. 

(j) 
       
     Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices. 

(k) 
       
     Projections of nuclear decommissioning trust contributions are based on the 2007 Retail
Rate Plan and are subject to change in Georgia Power s 2010 retail rate case. 

(l) 
       
     Southern Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period.
Southern Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension
trust fund is 2012 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections of the amount
vary significantly depending on key variables including future trust fund performance and cannot be
determined at this time. Therefore, no amounts related to the pension trust fund are included in
the table. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the
pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit payments
will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from Southern
Company s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

General 

The Southern Company (the Company) is the parent company of four traditional operating companies,
Southern Power Company (Southern Power), Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern
Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern
Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and
indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating companies, Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power),
Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power), and Mississippi Power
Company (Mississippi Power), are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in four
Southeastern states. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and
sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company,
provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies.
SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its
subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber cable
services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for
Southern Company s investments in leveraged leases. Southern Nuclear operates and provides
services to Southern Company s nuclear power plants.

The financial statements reflect Southern Company s investments in the subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis. The equity method is used for entities in which the Company has significant
influence but does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the
primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior years  data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

The traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and certain of their subsidiaries are subject
to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the traditional operating
companies are also subject to regulation by their respective state public service commissions
(PSC). The companies follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by their respective commissions. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Related Party Transactions 

Alabama Power and Georgia Power purchased synthetic fuel from Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), an
entity in which Southern Holdings held a 30% ownership interest until July 2006, when its ownership
interest was terminated. Synfuel Services, Inc. (SSI), another subsidiary of Southern Holdings,
provided fuel transportation services to AFP that were ultimately reflected in the cost of the
synthetic fuel billed to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Subsequent to the termination of
Southern Company s membership interest in AFP, Alabama Power and Georgia Power continued to
purchase an additional $6 million and $750 million in fuel from AFP in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
SSI continued to provide fuel transportation services of $131 million in 2007, which were
eliminated against fuel expense in the financial statements. SSI also provided other additional
services to AFP and a related party of AFP totaling $47 million in 2007. The synthetic fuel
investments and related party transactions were terminated on December 31, 2007.

NOTES (continued) 

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 

The traditional operating companies are subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board in accounting for the effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance
sheets at December 31 relate to:

Note: The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are
as follows: 

(a) 
       
     Asset retirement and removal assets and liabilities are recorded, deferred income tax assets are recovered, other cost of removal, and deferred
tax liabilities are amortized over the related property lives, which may range up to 65 years. Asset retirement and removal assets and liabilities
will be settled and trued up following completion of the related activities. Other cost of removal obligations include $216 million at Georgia
Power that may be amortized during 2010 in accordance with the August 27, 2009 Georgia PSC order. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters  
Georgia Power   Cost of Removal  for additional information. 

(b) 
       
     Recovered over either the remaining life of the original issue or, if refinanced, over the life of the new issue, which may range up to 50 years. 

(c) 
       
     Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year. 

(d) 
       
     Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the appropriate state PSCs over periods not exceeding 10 years. 

(e) 
       
     Recovered and amortized over the average remaining service period which may range up to 15 years. See Note 2 for additional information. 

(f) 
       
     Recovered over the remaining lives of the buildings through 2026. 

(g) 
       
     This balance represents deferred revenue associated with Georgia Power s environmental compliance cost recovery (ECCR) tariff established in its
retail rate plan for the years 2008 through 2010 (2007 Retail Rate Plan). The recovery of the forecasted environmental compliance costs was
levelized to collect equal annual amounts between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010 under the tariff. 

(h) 
       
     Recovered as storm restoration or environmental remediation expenses are incurred. 

(i) 
       
     Not earning a return as offset in rate base by a corresponding asset or liability. 

(j) 
       
     Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the appropriate state PSC over periods up to the life of the plant or the remaining life of
the original issue or, if refinanced, over the life of the new issue which may range up to 50 years. 

In the event that a portion of a traditional operating company s operations is no longer
subject to applicable accounting rules for rate regulation, such company would be required to write
off or reclassify to accumulated other comprehensive income related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the
traditional operating company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets,
including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All
regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates. See Note 3 under  Retail
Regulatory Matters   Alabama

Revenues 

Wholesale capacity revenues are generally recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate
contract periods. Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled
revenues related to retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for
the traditional operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel
costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs.
Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current
regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance
sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing factors.

Retail fuel cost recovery mechanisms vary by each traditional operating company, but in general,
the process requires periodic filings with the appropriate state PSC. Alabama Power continuously
monitors the under/over recovered balance and files for a revised fuel rate when management deems
appropriate. Georgia Power filed a new fuel case on December 15, 2009. The new rates are expected
to become effective April 1, 2010. Gulf Power is required to notify the Florida PSC if the
projected fuel cost over or under recovery exceeds 10% of the projected fuel revenue applicable for
the period and indicate if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor is being requested.
Mississippi Power is required to file for an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor annually.
See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Alabama Power   Fuel Cost Recovery  and  Retail
Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Fuel Cost Recovery  for additional information.

Southern Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10%
or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of
revenues.

Fuel Costs 

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes the cost of purchased
emissions allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of
nuclear fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. See Note 3 under  Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs  for additional information.

Income and Other Taxes 

Southern Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides
deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits (ITCs) for the
traditional operating companies are amortized over the lives of the related property with such
amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation in the statements of income.
Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $24 million in 2009, $23 million in 2008, and $23
million in 2007. At December 31, 2009, all ITCs available to reduce federal income taxes payable
had been utilized.

Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, certain renewable projects at Southern
Company s non-regulated subsidiaries are eligible for ITCs or cash grants. These non-regulated
companies have elected to receive ITCs. The credits are recorded as a
deferred credit, which will be amortized over the life of the asset,
and the tax basis of the asset is  reduced by
50% of the credits received, resulting in a deferred tax asset. The non-regulated companies have
elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense
as costs are incurred during the construction period. This basis difference will reverse and be
recorded to income tax expense over the useful life of the asset once placed in service.

In accordance with accounting standards related to the uncertainty in income taxes, Southern
Company recognizes tax positions that are  more likely than not  of being sustained upon
examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
for additional information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

II-50 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Southern Company s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling costs, which are recorded
in accordance with specific state PSC orders. Alabama Power accrues estimated nuclear refueling
costs in advance of the unit s next refueling outage. Georgia Power defers and amortizes nuclear
refueling costs over the unit s operating cycle before the next refueling. The refueling cycles
for Alabama Power and Georgia Power range from 18 to 24 months for each unit. In accordance with a
Georgia PSC order, Georgia Power also defers the costs of certain significant inspection costs for
the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizes such costs over 10 years, which
approximates the expected maintenance cycle.

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.2% in 2009, 3.2% in 2008, and 3.0% in 2007.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies are
filed with the respective state PSC for the traditional operating companies. Accumulated
depreciation for utility plant in service totaled $18.7 billion and $17.9 billion at December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or
otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with the cost
of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions,
the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet accounts and a
gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are
retired when the related property unit is retired.

Under Georgia Power s retail rate plan for the three years ended December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail
Rate Plan), Georgia Power was ordered to recognize Georgia PSC-certified capacity costs in rates
evenly over the three years covered by the 2004 Retail Rate Plan. Georgia Power recorded credits
to amortization of $19 million in 2007. The 2007 Retail Rate Plan did not include a similar order.
On August 27, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved an accounting order allowing Georgia Power to
amortize up to $324 million of its regulatory liability related to other cost of removal
obligations. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Cost of Removal  for
additional information.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power s request to reclassify 266 megawatts
(MWs) of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 capacity to jurisdictional cost of service effective January 1,
2004 and authorized Mississippi Power to include the related costs and revenue credits in
jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue requirement calculations for purposes of
retail rate recovery. Mississippi Power amortized the related regulatory liability, pursuant to
the Mississippi PSC s order, by $6 million in 2007 resulting in an increase to earnings in that
year.

Depreciation of the original cost of other plant in service is provided primarily on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three to 30 years. Accumulated
depreciation for other plant in service totaled $419 million and $433 million at December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal 

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset s useful life.
The Company has received accounting guidance from the various state PSCs allowing the continued
accrual of

II-51 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are
reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory
Matters   Georgia Power   Cost of Removal  for additional information related to Georgia Power s
cost of removal regulatory liability.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company s nuclear
facilities, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally restricted for
settling retirement obligations related to nuclear facilities as of December 31, 2009 was $1.1
billion. In addition, the Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites,
underground storage tanks, asbestos removal, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain
transformers. The Company also has identified retirement obligations related to certain
transmission and distribution facilities, co-generation facilities, certain wireless communication
towers, and certain structures authorized by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However,
liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the range of time over
which the Company may settle these obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The
Company will continue to recognize in the statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance
with its regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance with
accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations, and those reflected
in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability, as ordered by the various state
PSCs, and are reflected in the balance sheets. See  Nuclear Decommissioning  herein for further
information on amounts included in rates.

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

Nuclear Decommissioning 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama
Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (the Funds) to comply with the NRC s regulations.
Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the Funds are managed and
invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the
NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Funds are
required to be held by one or more trustees with an individual net worth of at least $100 million.
The FERC requires the Funds  managers to exercise the standard of care in investing that a  prudent
investor  would use in the same circumstances. The FERC regulations also require, except for
investments tied to market indices or other mutual funds, that the Funds  managers may not invest
in any securities of the utility for which it manages funds or its affiliates. In addition, the
NRC prohibits investments in securities of power reactor licensees. While Southern Company is
allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds  managers, neither Southern Company
nor its subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds
or to mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the
Funds is delegated to unrelated third party managers with oversight by Southern Company, Alabama
Power, and Georgia Power management. The Funds  managers are authorized, within broad limits, to
actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the investment return
on the Funds  investments. The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix
of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as trading securities.

Southern Company records the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in
Note 10. Gains and losses, whether realized, unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary,
are recorded in the regulatory liability for asset retirement obligations in the balance sheets and
are not included in net income or other comprehensive income. Fair value adjustments, realized
gains, and other-than-temporary impairment losses are determined on a specific identification
basis.

At December 31, 2009, investment securities in the Funds totaled $1.1 billion consisting of equity
securities of $774 million, debt securities of $272 million, and $22 million of other securities.
At December 31, 2008, investment securities in the Funds totaled $862 million consisting of equity
securities of $518 million, debt securities of $323 million, and $21 million of other securities.
These
amounts exclude receivables related to investment income and pending investment sales, and payables
related to pending investment purchases.

II-52 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Sales of the securities held in the Funds resulted in cash proceeds of $1.2 billion, $712
million, and $775 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, all of which were reinvested. For
2009, fair value increases, including reinvested interest and dividends and excluding expenses,
were $215 million, of which $198 million related to securities held in the Funds at December 31,
2009. For 2008, fair value reductions, including reinvested interest and dividends and excluding
expenses, were $(278) million. Realized gains and other-than-temporary impairment losses were $78
million and $(76) million, respectively, in 2007. While the investment securities held in the
Funds are reported as trading securities, the Funds continue to be managed with a long-term focus.
Accordingly, all purchases and sales within the Funds are presented separately in the statement of
cash flows as investing cash flows, consistent with the nature of and purpose for which the
securities were acquired.

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over periods approved by the Alabama PSC. The NRC s minimum external funding requirements
are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a
nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have filed
plans with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the external
trust funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

At December 31, 2009, the accumulated provisions for decommissioning were as follows:

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year. The
estimated costs of decommissioning based on the most current studies, which were performed in 2008
for Plant Farley and in 2009 for the Georgia Power plants, were as follows for Alabama Power s
Plant Farley and Georgia Power s ownership interests in Plants Hatch and Vogtle:

The decommissioning periods and site study costs for Plant Vogtle reflect the extended operating
license approved by the NRC on June 3, 2009. The decommissioning cost estimates are based on
prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may
vary from the above estimates because of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in
NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used in making these estimates.

For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power s decommissioning costs are based on the site study, and
Georgia Power s decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the
radioactive portion of the facilities as of 2006. The estimates used in current rates are $531
million and $366 million for Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Amounts expensed were $3
million annually for 2009 and 2008 and $7 million for 2007 for Plant Vogtle. Significant
assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5% and 2.9%
for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and a trust earnings rate of 7.0% and 4.9% for
Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. As a result of license extensions, amounts
previously contributed to the external trust funds for Plants Hatch and Farley are currently
projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized 

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the traditional operating companies record AFUDC, which
represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the
construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such
allowance, it increases the revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher
rate base and
higher depreciation. The equity component of AFUDC is not included in calculating taxable income.
Interest related to the construction of new facilities not included in the traditional operating
companies  regulated rates is capitalized in accordance with

II-53 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

standard interest capitalization requirements. AFUDC and interest capitalized, net of income
taxes were 15.3%, 11.2%, and 8.4% of net income for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Cash payments for interest totaled $788 million, $787 million, and $798 million in 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively, net of amounts capitalized of $84 million, $71 million, and $64 million,
respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles 

Southern Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Storm Damage Reserves 

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve to cover the cost of damages from major
storms to its transmission and distribution lines and generally the cost of uninsured damages to
its generation facilities and other property. In accordance with their respective state PSC
orders, the traditional operating companies accrued $44 million in 2009. Alabama Power, Gulf
Power, and Mississippi Power also have discretionary authority from their state PSCs to accrue
certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. In 2009, such additional accruals totaled $40
million. There were no material accruals for 2008 or 2007.

Leveraged Leases 

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements, with terms ranging up to 45 years, which
relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets.
Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well
as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. The Company reviews all important
lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. These assumptions include the
effective tax rate, the residual value, the credit quality of the lessees, and the timing of
expected tax cash flows.

Southern Company s net investment in domestic leveraged leases consists of the following at
December 31:

A summary of the components of income from domestic leveraged leases was as follows:

II-54

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Southern Company s net investment in international leveraged leases consists of the following
at December 31:

A summary of the components of income from international leveraged leases was as follows:

The Company terminated two international leveraged lease investments during 2009. The proceeds
were used to extinguish all debt related to leveraged lease investments, a portion of which had
make-whole redemption provisions. This resulted in a $17 million loss which partially offset a $26
million gain on the terminations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies 

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory 

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emissions allowances.
Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the
traditional operating companies through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC.
Emissions allowances granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory
at zero cost.

Financial Instruments 

Southern Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (included in
 Other  or shown separately as  Risk Management Activities ) and are measured at fair value. See
Note 10 for additional information. Substantially all of Southern Company s bulk energy purchases
and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are excluded from fair value
accounting requirements because they qualify for the  normal  scope exception, and are accounted
for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of
anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional operating companies  fuel
hedging programs. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur.
Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other
derivative contracts, including derivatives related to synthetic fuel investments, are marked to
market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income.
See Note 11 for additional information.

II-55 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. At December 31, 2009, the
amount included in  Accounts payable  in the balance sheets that the Company has recognized for the
obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments was not material.

Southern Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties  nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company s exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

Comprehensive Income 

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, certain changes in pension and other
postretirement benefit plans, and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balances, net of tax effects, were as follows:

Variable Interest Entities 

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. Certain of the traditional operating companies have established certain wholly-owned
trusts to issue preferred securities. See Note 6 under  Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated
Trusts  for additional information. However, Southern Company and the applicable traditional
operating companies are not considered the primary beneficiaries of the trusts. Therefore, the
investments in these trusts are reflected as Other Investments, and the related loans from the
trusts are included in Long-term Debt in the balance sheets.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS 

Southern Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all
employees. The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the plan are expected for the year
ending December 31, 2010. Southern Company also provides certain defined benefit pension plans for
a selected group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these
non-qualified pension plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, Southern Company provides
certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement
benefit plans. The traditional operating companies fund related trusts to the extent required by
their respective regulatory commissions. For the year ending December 31, 2010, postretirement
trust contributions are expected to total approximately $43 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2009 and 2008 was December 31 while the
measurement date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to accounting standards related to
defined postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company was required to change the measurement date
for its defined postretirement benefit plans from September 30 to December 31 beginning with the
year ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, Southern Company adopted the measurement date
provisions effective January 1, 2008, resulting in an increase in long-term liabilities of $28
million and an increase in prepaid pension costs of approximately $16 million.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Pension Plans 

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $6.3 billion in 2009 and $5.5
billion in 2008. Changes during the plan year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15-month period ended
December 31, 2008 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were as
follows:

At December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $6.3 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to the
qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). In
2009, in determining the optimal asset allocation for the pension fund, the Company performed an
extensive study based on projections of both assets and liabilities over a 10-year forward horizon.
The primary goal of the study was to maximize plan funded status. The Company s investment policy
covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real estate, and
private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily to gain efficient exposure to the
various asset classes and as hedging tools. The Company minimizes the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk. The actual
composition of the Company s pension plan assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, along with the
targeted mix of assets, is presented below:

The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Company s defined benefit plan is to be
broadly diversified across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after
consideration of various factors that affect the assets and liabilities of the pension plan
including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns, volatility, correlations of asset
classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and
liabilities. Because a significant portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in
nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment expectations for return and
risk. To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the
Company employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment
managers and service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent
investment practices.

II-57 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Detailed below is a description of the investment strategies for each major asset category
disclosed above:

Domestic equity.   This portion of the portfolio comprises a mix of large and small
capitalization stocks with generally an equal distribution of value and growth attributes
managed both actively and through passive index approaches. 

International equity.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed with a blend of
growth stocks and value stocks with both developed and emerging market exposure. 

Fixed income.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed through an allocation to
long-dated, investment grade corporate and government bonds. 

Special situations.   Though currently unfunded, this portion of the portfolio was established
both to execute opportunistic investment strategies with the objectives of diversifying and
enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as to invest in promising
new strategies of a longer-term nature. 

Real estate investments.   Assets in this portion of the portfolio are invested in traditional
private market, equity-oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate securities. 

Private equity.   This portion of the portfolio generally consists of investments in private
partnerships that invest in private or public securities typically through privately
negotiated and/or structured transactions. Leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed
debt are examples of investment strategies within this category. 

The fair values of pension plan assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are presented below. These
fair value measurements exclude cash, receivables related to investment income, pending investments
sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases.

* 
       
     Level 1 securities consist of actively traded stocks while Level 2 securities consist of
pooled funds. Management believes that the portfolio is well-diversified with no
significant concentrations of risk.

     Level 1 securities consist of actively traded stocks while Level 2 securities consist of
pooled funds. Management believes that the portfolio is well-diversified with no
significant concentrations of risk. 

Changes in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 items in the pension plan assets valued
using significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as
follows:

The fair values presented above are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards
regarding fair value. For purposes of determining the fair value of the pension plan assets and
the appropriate level designation, management relies on information provided by the plan s trustee.
This information is reviewed and evaluated by management with changes made to the trustee
information as appropriate.

II-59 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Securities for which the activity is observable on an active market or traded exchange are
categorized as Level 1. Fixed income securities classified as Level 2 are valued using matrix
pricing, a common model using observable inputs. Domestic and international equity securities
classified as Level 2 consist of pooled funds where the value is not quoted on an exchange but
where the value is determined using observable inputs from the market. Securities that are valued
using unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3 and include investments in real estate and
investments in limited partnerships. The Company invests (through the pension plan trustee)
directly in the limited partnerships which then invest in various types of funds or various private
entities within a fund. The fair value of the limited partnerships  investments is based on
audited annual capital accounts statements which are generally prepared on a fair value basis. The
Company also relies on the fact that, in most instances, the underlying assets held by the limited
partnerships are reported at fair value. External investment managers typically send valuations to
both the custodian and to the Company within 90 days of quarter end. The custodian reports the
most recent value available and adjusts the value for cash flows since the statement date for each
respective fund.

Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets related to the Company s pension plans
consist of the following:

Presented below are the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income and regulatory
assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 related to the defined benefit pension plans that had not yet
been recognized in net periodic pension cost along with the estimated amortization of such amounts
for 2010.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The components of other comprehensive income, along with the changes in the balances of regulatory
assets and regulatory liabilities, related to the defined benefit pension plans for the year ended
December 31, 2009 and the 15 months ended December 31, 2008 are presented in the following table:

Components of net periodic pension cost were as follows:

Net periodic pension cost is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs netted against
the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined by
multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets.
In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to amortize
changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate the
expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2009, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

Other Postretirement Benefits 

Changes during the plan year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15-month period ended December 31,
2008 in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) and in the fair value of plan
assets were as follows:

Other postretirement benefit plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable
requirements, including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The Company s investment policy
covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real estate, and
private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily to gain efficient exposure to the
various asset classes and as hedging tools. The Company minimizes the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk. The actual
composition of the Company s other postretirement benefit plan assets as of the end of the year,
along with the targeted mix of assets, is presented below:

Detailed below is a description of the investment strategies for each major asset category
disclosed above:

Domestic equity.   This portion of the portfolio comprises a mix of large and small
capitalization stocks with generally an equal distribution of value and growth attributes
managed both actively and through passive index approaches. 

International equity.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed with a blend of
growth stocks and value stocks with both developed and emerging market exposure. 

Fixed income.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed through an allocation to
long-dated, investment grade corporate and government bonds. 

Special situations.   Though currently unfunded, this portion of the portfolio was established
both to execute opportunistic investment strategies with the objectives of diversifying and
enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as to invest in promising
new strategies of a longer-term nature. 

Trust-owned life insurance.   Some of the Company s taxable trusts invest in these investments
in order to minimize the impact of taxes on the portfolio. 

Real estate investments.   Assets in this portion of the portfolio are invested in traditional
private market, equity-oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate securities. 

II-62

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Private equity.   This portion of the portfolio generally consists of investments in private
partnerships that invest in private or public securities typically through privately
negotiated and/or structured transactions. Leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed
debt are examples of investment strategies within this category. 

The fair values of other postretirement benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are
presented below. These fair value measurements exclude cash, receivables related to investment
income, pending investments sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases.

* 
       
     Level 1 securities consist of actively traded stocks while Level 2 securities consist of
pooled funds. Management believes that the portfolio is well-diversified with no
significant concentrations of risk.

Changes in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 items in the other postretirement benefit
plan assets valued using significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008 are as follows:

The fair values presented above are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards
regarding fair value. For purposes of determining the fair value of the pension plan assets and
the appropriate level designation, management relies on information provided by the plan s trustee.
This information is reviewed and evaluated by management with changes made to the trustee
information as appropriate.

Securities for which the activity is observable on an active market or traded exchange are
categorized as Level 1. Fixed income securities classified as Level 2 are valued using matrix
pricing, a common model using observable inputs. Domestic and international equity securities
classified as Level 2 consist of pooled funds where the value is not quoted on an exchange but
where the value is determined using observable inputs from the market. Securities that are valued
using unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3 and include investments in real estate and
investments in limited partnerships. The Company invests (through the pension plan trustee)
directly in the limited partnerships which then invest in various types of funds or various private
entities within a fund. The fair value of the limited partnerships  investments is based on
audited annual capital accounts statements which are generally prepared on a fair value basis. The
Company also relies on the fact that, in most instances, the underlying assets held by the limited
partnerships are reported at fair value. External investment managers typically send valuations to
both the custodian and to the Company within 90 days of quarter end. The custodian reports the
most recent value available and adjusts the value for cash flows since the statement date for each
respective fund.

Amounts recognized in the balance sheets related to the Company s other postretirement benefit
plans consist of the following:

II-64

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Presented below are the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income and regulatory
assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 related to the other postretirement benefit plans that had not
yet been recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost along with the estimated
amortization of such amounts for 2010.

The components of other comprehensive income, along with the changes in the balance of regulatory
assets, related to the other postretirement benefit plans for the plan year ended December 31, 2009
and the 15 months ended December 31, 2008 are presented in the following table:

II-65 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Components of the other postretirement benefit plans  net periodic cost were as follows:

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) provides
a 28% prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the subsidy reduced
Southern Company s expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 by approximately
$33 million, $35 million, and $35 million, respectively.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service and
are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for the
postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy receipts expected as
a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions 

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2006 for the 2007 plan year using a discount rate of 6.00% and an annual
salary increase of 3.50%.

The Company estimates the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit
plan assets using a financial model to project the expected return on each current investment
portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each of seven different asset
classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust s
target asset allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on
four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset class (based in part on historical returns), each
trust s asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact of a periodic
rebalancing of each trust s portfolio.

II-66 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 8.50% for 2010, decreasing gradually to 5.25% through the year 2016 and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%
would affect the APBO and the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2009 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan 

Southern Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all
employees. The Company provides an 85% matching contribution up to 6% of an employee s base
salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $78 million,
$76 million, and $73 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

General Litigation Matters 

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. In addition, the business activities of Southern Company s
subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the
environment such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury,
common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air
and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury and other claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and
common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas and other emissions, have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or
potential litigation against Southern Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this
time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not
anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a
material adverse effect on Southern Company s financial statements.

Mirant Matters 

Mirant Corporation (Mirant) was an energy company with businesses that included independent power
projects and energy trading and risk management companies in the U.S. and selected other countries.
It was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company until its initial public offering in October
2000. In April 2001, Southern Company completed a spin-off to its shareholders of its remaining
ownership, and Mirant became an independent corporate entity.

In July 2003, Mirant and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
The Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming Mirant s plan of reorganization in December 2005,
and Mirant announced that this plan became effective in January 2006. As part of the plan, Mirant
transferred substantially all of its assets and its restructured debt to a new corporation that
adopted the name Mirant Corporation (Reorganized Mirant).

Under the terms of the separation agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off, Mirant
agreed to indemnify Southern Company for certain costs. As a result of Mirant s bankruptcy,
Southern Company sought reimbursement as an unsecured creditor in Mirant s Chapter 11 proceeding.
If Southern Company s claims for indemnification with respect to these costs are allowed, then
Mirant s indemnity obligations to Southern Company would constitute unsecured claims against Mirant
entitled to stock in Reorganized Mirant. As a result of the $202 million settlement on March 31,
2009 of another suit related to Mirant (MC Asset Recovery litigation), the maximum amount
Southern Company can assert by proof of claim in the Mirant bankruptcy is capped at $9.5 million.
See Note 5 under  Effective Tax Rate  for more information regarding the MC Asset Recovery
settlement. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Environmental Matters 

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions
of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. After
Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action, the EPA filed a separate action in January
2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In
these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating
facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, including facilities co-owned by
Mississippi Power and Gulf Power. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief,
including an order requiring installation of the best available control technology at the affected
units. The EPA concurrently issued notices of violation to Gulf Power and Mississippi Power
relating to Gulf Power s Plant Crist and Mississippi Power s Plant Watson. In early 2000, the EPA
filed a motion to amend its complaint to add Gulf Power and Mississippi Power as defendants based
on the allegations in the notices of violation. However, in March 2001, the court denied the
motion based on lack of jurisdiction, and the EPA has not re-filed. The original action, now
solely against Georgia Power, has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the
case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

Southern Company believes that the traditional operating companies complied with applicable laws
and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.
The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly

II-68 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but the traditional operating
companies and Southern Power were named as defendants in an amended complaint which was rendered
moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi when such
court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at
this time.

Environmental Remediation  

Southern Company s subsidiaries must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the
handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the subsidiaries may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The
traditional operating companies have each received authority from their respective state PSCs to
recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. Within limits
approved by the state PSCs, these rates are adjusted annually or as necessary.

Georgia Power s environmental remediation liability as of December 31, 2009 was $12.5 million.
Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at sites
governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), including a large site in
Brunswick, Georgia on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). The parties have completed the
removal of wastes from the Brunswick site as ordered by the EPA. Additional claims for recovery of
natural resource damages at this site or for the assessment and potential cleanup of other sites on
the Georgia Hazardous Sites Inventory and CERCLA NPL are anticipated.

By letter dated September 30, 2008, the EPA advised Georgia Power that it has been designated as a
PRP at the Ward Transformer Superfund site located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Numerous other
entities have also received notices from the EPA. Georgia Power, along with other named PRPs, is
negotiating with the EPA to address cleanup of the site and reimbursement for past expenditures
related to work performed at the site. In addition, on April 30, 2009, two PRPs filed separate
actions in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against numerous
other PRPs, including Georgia Power, seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred
by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site. The ultimate outcome of
these matters will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of PRPs and
cannot be determined at this time; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on
Southern Company s financial statements.

Gulf Power s environmental remediation liability includes estimated costs of environmental
remediation projects of approximately $65.2 million as of December 31, 2009. These estimated costs
relate to site closure criteria by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for
potential impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide applications at Gulf Power substations.
The schedule for completion of the remediation projects will be subject to FDEP approval. The
projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery through Gulf Power s environmental cost
recovery clause; therefore, there was no impact on net income as a result of these estimates.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the currently known
conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites,
management does not believe that additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material
to the financial statements .

FERC Matters 

Market-Based Rate Authority  

Each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power has authorization from the FERC to
sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices.
Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company s generation market
power within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets was not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by any subsidiary of
Southern Company in Southern Company s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month
refund period that ended in May 2006 could have been subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

On December 23, 2009, Southern Company and the FERC trial staff reached an agreement in principle
that would resolve the proceeding in its entirety. The agreement does not reflect any finding or
suggestion that any subsidiary of Southern Company possesses or has exercised any market power.
The agreement likewise does not require Southern Company to make any refunds related to sales
during the 15-month refund period. The agreement does provide for the traditional operating
companies and Southern Power to donate a total of $1.7 million to nonprofit organizations in the
states in which they operate for the purpose of offsetting the electricity bills of low-income
retail customers. The agreement is subject to review and approval by the FERC.

Intercompany Interchange Contract  

The Company s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new
proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies,
Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is
operated, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC s standards of conduct
applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company s
code of conduct defining Southern Power as a  system company  rather than a  marketing affiliate 
is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized
Southern Power s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern
Company s code of conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement s terms.
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. In December 2008, the FERC division of audits issued
for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and related
matters. No comments were submitted challenging the audit report s findings of Southern Company s
compliance. The proceeding remains open pending a decision from the FERC regarding the audit
report.

Right of Way Litigation 

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Mississippi Power, have been named as
defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs  lawsuits claim
that defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic
communications lines on the rights of way that cross the plaintiffs  properties and that such
actions exceed the easements or other property rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert
claims for, among other things, trespass and unjust enrichment and seek compensatory and punitive
damages and injunctive relief. Management of Southern Company believes that its subsidiaries have
complied with applicable laws and that the plaintiffs  claims are without merit.

To date, Mississippi Power has entered into agreements with plaintiffs in approximately 95% of the
actions pending against Mississippi Power to clarify its easement rights in the State of
Mississippi. These agreements have been approved by the Circuit Courts of Harrison County and
Jasper County, Mississippi (First Judicial Circuit), and the related cases have been dismissed.
These agreements have not resulted in any material effects on Southern Company s financial
statements.

II-70 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Mississippi Power,
were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought in Troup County, Georgia, Superior Court by
Interstate Fibernet, Inc., a subsidiary of telecommunications company ITC DeltaCom, Inc. that uses
certain of the defendants  rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the
defendants are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
telecommunications company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future
right of way litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff s claims are without merit. In
the fall of 2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner
litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the
telecommunications company s appeal of the trial court s order for lack of jurisdiction. An
adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications
company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs 

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE), which provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The
DOE failed to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contracts, and
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of
contract.

In July 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded Georgia Power approximately $30 million,
based on its ownership interests, and awarded Alabama Power approximately $17 million, representing
substantially all of the direct costs of the expansion of spent nuclear fuel storage facilities at
Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle from 1998 through 2004. In November 2007, the government s motion
for reconsideration was denied. In January 2008, the government filed an appeal and, in February
2008, filed a motion to stay the appeal. In April 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit granted the government s motion to stay the appeal pending the court s decisions in three
other similar cases already on appeal. Those cases were decided in August 2008. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit has left the stay of appeals in place pending the decision in an
appeal of another case involving spent nuclear fuel contracts.

In April 2008, a second claim against the government was filed for damages incurred after December
31, 2004 (the court-mandated cut-off in the original claim), due to the government s alleged
continuing breach of contract. In October 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
denied a similar request by the government to stay this proceeding. The complaint does not contain
any specific dollar amount for recovery of damages. Damages will continue to accumulate until the
issue is resolved or the storage is provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial
statements as of December 31, 2009 for either claim. The final outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time, but no material impact on net income is expected as any damage amounts
collected from the government are expected to be returned to customers.

Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core
discharge capability for both units into 2014. Construction of an on-site dry storage facility at
Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge
capability. At Plants Hatch and Farley, on-site dry storage facilities are operational and can be
expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of each plant.

Income Tax Matters 

Georgia Power s 2005 through 2008 income tax filings for the State of Georgia include state income
tax credits for increased activity through Georgia ports. Georgia Power has also filed similar
claims for the years 2002 through 2004. The Georgia Department of Revenue has not responded to
these claims. In July 2007, Georgia Power filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County
to recover the credits claimed for the years 2002 through 2004. An unrecognized tax benefit has
been recorded related to these credits. See Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  for
additional information. If Georgia Power prevails, these claims could have a significant, and
possibly material, positive effect on Southern Company s net income. If Georgia Power is not
successful, payment of the related state tax could have a significant, and possibly material,
negative effect on Southern Company s cash flow. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters 

Alabama Power  

Retail Rate Plans 

Alabama Power operates under a Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate RSE) approved by the
Alabama PSC. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable
upcoming calendar year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot
exceed 4% per year and any annual adjustment is limited to 5%. Retail rates remain unchanged when
the retail return on common equity (ROE) is projected to be between 13% and 14.5%. If Alabama
Power s actual retail ROE is above the allowed equity return range, customer refunds will be
required; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail
ROE fall below the allowed equity return range. In October 2008, the Alabama PSC approved a
corrective rate package effective January 2009, that primarily provides for adjustments associated
with customer charges to certain existing rate structures. Alabama Power agreed to a moratorium on
any increase in rates in 2009 under Rate RSE. On December 1, 2009, Alabama Power made its Rate RSE
submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2010. The Rate RSE increase for
2010 is 3.2%, or $152 million annually, and became effective in January 2010. The revenue
adjustment under the Rate RSE is largely attributable to the costs associated with fossil capacity
which is currently dedicated to certain long-term wholesale contracts that expire during 2010.
Retail cost of service for 2010 reflects the costs for that portion of the year in which this
capacity is no longer committed to wholesale. In an Alabama PSC order dated January 5, 2010, the
Alabama PSC acknowledged that a full calendar year of costs for such capacity would be reflected in
the Rate RSE calculation beginning in 2011 and thereafter. Under the terms of Rate RSE, the
maximum increase for 2011 cannot exceed 4.76%.

The Alabama PSC has also approved a rate mechanism that provides for adjustments to recognize the
cost of placing new generating facilities in retail service and for the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated power purchase agreements (PPAs) under a Rate Certificated New Plant
(Rate CNP). There was no adjustment to Rate CNP in April 2007, 2008, or 2009. Effective April
2010, Rate CNP will be reduced approximately $70 million annually, primarily due to the expiration
on May 31, 2010 of the PPA with Southern Power covering the capacity of Plant Harris Unit 1. Rate
CNP also allows for the recovery of Alabama Power s retail costs associated with environmental
laws, regulations, or other such mandates. The rate mechanism is based on forward-looking
information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated
annually. Environmental costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital. Retail rates increased approximately 2.4% in
January 2008 and 0.6% in January 2007 due to environmental costs. In October 2008, Alabama Power
agreed to defer collection during 2009 of any increase in rates under this portion of Rate CNP
which permits recovery of costs associated with environmental laws and regulations until 2010. The
deferral of the retail rate adjustments had an immaterial impact on annual cash flows, and had no
significant effect on Southern Company s revenues or net income in 2009. On December 1, 2009,
Alabama Power made its Rate CNP environmental submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for
calendar year 2010. The Rate CNP environmental increase for 2010 is 4.3%, or $195 million
annually, based upon projected billings. Under the terms of the rate mechanism, the adjustment
became effective in January 2010. The Rate CNP environmental adjustment is primarily attributable
to scrubbers being placed in service during 2010 at four of Alabama Power s generating plants.

Fuel Cost Recovery 

Alabama Power has established fuel cost recovery rates under an energy cost recovery clause (Rate
ECR) approved by the Alabama PSC. Rates are based on an estimate of future energy costs and the
current over or under recovered balance. In June 2007, the Alabama PSC approved Alabama Power s
request to increase the retail energy cost recovery rate to 3.100 cents per kilowatt hour (KWH),
effective with billings beginning July 2007. In October 2008, the Alabama PSC approved an increase
in Alabama Power s Rate ECR factor to 3.983 cents per KWH effective with billings beginning October
2008. On June 2, 2009, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease in Alabama Power s Rate ECR factor to
3.733 cents per KWH for billings beginning June 9, 2009. On December 1, 2009, the Alabama PSC
approved a decrease in Alabama Power s Rate ECR factor to 2.731 cents per KWH for billings
beginning January 2010 through December 2011. The Alabama PSC further approved an additional
reduction in the Rate ECR factor of 0.328 cents per KWH for the billing months of January 2010
through December 2010 resulting in a Rate ECR factor of 2.403 cents per KWH for such 12-month
period. For billing months beginning January 2012, the Rate ECR factor shall be 5.910 cents per
KWH, absent a contrary order by the Alabama PSC. Rate ECR revenues, as recorded on the financial
statements, are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in
current regulated rates. Accordingly, the approved decreases in the Rate ECR factor will have no
significant effect on Southern Company s net income, but will decrease operating cash flows related
to fuel cost recovery in 2010 when compared to 2009. As of December 31, 2009, Alabama Power had an
over recovered fuel balance of approximately $200 million, of which approximately $22 million is
included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred in the balance sheets. Alabama Power, along
with the Alabama PSC, will continue to monitor the over recovered fuel cost balance to determine
whether an additional adjustment to billing rates is required.

Retail Rate Plans 

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the 2004 Retail Rate Plan. Under the terms of the 2004
Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power s earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25% to
12.25%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25% were applied to rate refunds, with the remaining
one-third retained by Georgia Power. Retail rates and customer fees increased by approximately
$203 million effective January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased power, operating and
maintenance expenses, environmental compliance, and continued investment in new generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. In 2007,
Georgia Power refunded 2005 earnings above 12.25% retail ROE. There were no refunds related to
earnings for 2007.

In December 2007, the Georgia PSC approved the 2007 Retail Rate Plan. Under the 2007 Retail Rate
Plan, Georgia Power s earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%.
Retail base rates increased by approximately $100 million effective January 1, 2008 to provide for
cost recovery of transmission, distribution, generation, and other investments, as well as
increased operating costs. In addition, the ECCR tariff was implemented to allow for the recovery
of costs related to environmental projects mandated by state and federal regulations. The ECCR
tariff increased rates by approximately $222 million effective January 1, 2008. In connection with
the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power agreed that it would not file for a general base rate
increase during this period unless its projected retail ROE falls below 10.25%. Georgia Power is
required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be
expected to determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan should be continued, modified, or
discontinued.

Cost of Removal 

The economic recession has significantly reduced Georgia Power s revenues upon which retail rates
were set under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan. In June 2009, despite stringent efforts to reduce
expenses, Georgia Power s projected retail ROE for both 2009 and 2010 was below 10.25%. However,
in lieu of filing to increase customer rates as allowed under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, on June
29, 2009, Georgia Power filed a request with the Georgia PSC for an accounting order that would
allow Georgia Power to amortize up to $324 million of its regulatory liability related to other
cost of removal obligations.

On August 27, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved the accounting order. Under the terms of the
accounting order, Georgia Power was entitled to amortize up to one-third of the regulatory
liability ($108 million) in 2009, limited to the amount needed to earn no more than a 9.75% retail
ROE. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Georgia Power amortized $41 million of the regulatory
liability. In addition, Georgia Power may amortize up to two-thirds of the regulatory liability
($216 million) in 2010, limited to the amount needed to earn no more than a 10.15% retail ROE.

Fuel Cost Recovery 

Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. The Georgia
PSC approved increases in Georgia Power s total annual billings of approximately $383 million
effective March 1, 2007 and approximately $222 million effective June 1, 2008.
On December 15,
2009, Georgia Power filed for a fuel cost recovery increase with the
Georgia PSC. On February 22, 2010, Georgia Power, the Georgia PSC
Public Interest Advocacy Staff, and three customer groups entered into
a stipulation to resolve the case, subject to approval by the Georgia
PSC (the Stipulation). Under the terms of the Stipulation, Georgia
Power s annual fuel cost recovery billings will increase by
approximately $425 million. In addition, Georgia Power will implement
an interim fuel rider, which would allow Georgia Power to adjust its
fuel cost recovery rates prior to the next fuel case if the under
recovered fuel balance exceeds budget by more than $75 million.
Georgia Power is required to file its next fuel case by March 1, 2011.
The Georgia PSC is scheduled to vote on the Stipulation on March 11,
2010 with the new fuel rates to become effective April 1, 2010. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

As of
December 31, 2009, Georgia Power s  under recovered fuel
balance totaled approximately $665
million, which if the Stipulation is approved, Georgia Power will
recover over 32 months  beginning  April 1, 2010. Therefore,
approximately $373 million of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues for
Georgia Power is included in deferred charges and other assets  at December
31, 2009.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded in the financial statements are adjusted for differences in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, a change in
the billing factor has no significant effect on Southern Company s revenues or net income, but does
impact annual cash flow.

Nuclear Construction 

On August 26, 2009, the NRC issued an Early Site Permit and Limited Work Authorization to Southern
Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC), the Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), and the City of Dalton, Georgia, an incorporated municipality in
the State of Georgia acting by and through its Board of Water, Light and Sinking Fund Commissioners
(collectively, Owners), related to two additional nuclear units on the site of Plant Vogtle (Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4). See Note 4 for additional information on these co-owners. In March 2008,
Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a combined construction and operating
license for the new units. If licensed by the NRC, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are scheduled to be
placed in service in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

In April 2008, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium
consisting of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (Westinghouse) and Stone   Webster, Inc.
(collectively, Consortium) entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement to
design, engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units with electric generating
capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each and related facilities, structures, and improvements at
Plant Vogtle (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement).

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is an arrangement whereby the Consortium supplies and constructs the
entire facility with the exception of certain items provided by the Owners. Under the terms of the
Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Owners agreed to pay a purchase price that will be subject to certain
price escalations and adjustments, including certain index-based adjustments, as well as
adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses for early completion and unit performance.
Each Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its
ownership interest, of all amounts owed to the Consortium under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement.
Georgia Power s proportionate share is 45.7%.

On
February 23, 2010, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and the
Consortium entered into an amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. The amendment, which is
subject to the approval of the Georgia PSC, replaces certain of the index-based adjustments to the
purchase price with fixed escalation amounts.

On March 17, 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at
an in-service cost of $6.4 billion. In addition, the Georgia PSC voted to approve inclusion of the
related construction work in progress accounts in rate base.

On April 21, 2009, the Governor of the State of Georgia signed into law the Georgia Nuclear Energy
Financing Act that will allow Georgia Power to recover financing costs for nuclear construction
projects by including the related construction work in progress accounts in rate base during the
construction period. The cost recovery provisions will become effective on January 1, 2011. With
respect to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, this legislation allows Georgia Power to recover projected
financing costs of approximately $1.7 billion during the construction period beginning in 2011,
which reduces the projected in-service cost to approximately $4.4 billion.

On June 15, 2009, an environmental group filed a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia seeking review of the Georgia PSC s certification order and challenging the
constitutionality of the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act. Georgia Power believes there is no
meritorious basis for this petition and intends to vigorously defend against the requested actions.

On August 27, 2009, the NRC issued letters to Westinghouse revising the review schedules needed to
certify the AP1000 standard design for new reactors and expressing concerns related to the
availability of adequate information and the shield building design. The shield building protects
the containment and provides structural support to the containment cooling water supply. Georgia
Power is continuing to work with Westinghouse and the NRC to resolve these concerns. Any possible
delays in the AP1000 design certification schedule, including those addressed by the NRC in their
letters, are not currently expected to affect the projected commercial operation dates for Plant
Vogtle Units 3  and 4. 

There are pending technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Similar additional challenges at the state and federal level are expected as
construction proceeds.

On August 31, 2009, Georgia Power filed with the Georgia PSC its first semi-annual construction
monitoring report for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for the period ended June 30, 2009 which did not
include any proposed change to the estimated construction cost as certified by the Georgia PSC in
March 2009. On February 25, 2010, the Georgia PSC approved the expenditures made by Georgia Power
pursuant to the certification through June 30, 2009. The Georgia PSC also ordered that in its
future semi-annual construction monitoring reports, Georgia Power will report against a total
certified cost of approximately $6.1 billion, which is the effective certified amount after giving
effect to the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act as described above. Georgia Power will continue
to file construction monitoring reports by February 28 and August 31 of each year during the
construction period.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)  

On January 16, 2009, Mississippi Power filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity
with the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. The plant would utilize an advanced integrated coal gasification combined
cycle technology with an output capacity of 582 MWs. The Kemper IGCC will use locally mined
lignite from a proposed mine adjacent to the plant as fuel. This certificate, if approved by the
Mississippi PSC, would authorize Mississippi Power to acquire, construct and operate the Kemper
IGCC and related facilities. The Kemper IGCC, subject to federal and state reviews and certain
regulatory approvals, is expected to begin commercial operation in May 2014. The Mississippi PSC
has issued orders allowing Mississippi Power to defer the costs associated with the generation
resource planning, evaluation, and screening activities as a regulatory asset. As of December 31,
2009, Mississippi Power had spent a total of $73.5 million of such costs including regulatory
filing costs.

On November 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order that found Mississippi Power has a
demonstrated need for additional capacity. Hearings to determine the appropriate resource to fill
the need were held in February 2010 with a decision due by May 2010.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS 

Alabama Power owns an undivided interest in units 1 and 2 of Plant Miller and related facilities
jointly with Power South Energy Cooperative, Inc. Georgia Power owns undivided interests in Plants
Vogtle, Hatch, Scherer, and Wansley in varying amounts jointly with OPC, MEAG Power, the City of
Dalton, Georgia, Florida Power   Light Company, and Jacksonville Electric Authority. In addition,
Georgia Power has joint ownership agreements with OPC for the Rocky Mountain facilities and with
Florida Power Corporation for a combustion turbine unit at Intercession City, Florida. Southern
Power owns an undivided interest in Plant Stanton Unit A and related facilities jointly with the
Orlando Utilities Commission, Kissimmee Utility Authority, and Florida Municipal Power Agency.

At December 31, 2009, Alabama Power s, Georgia Power s, and Southern Power s ownership and
investment (exclusive of nuclear fuel) in jointly owned facilities with the above entities were as
follows:

At December 31, 2009, the portion of total construction work in progress related to Plants Miller,
Scherer, Wansley, and Vogtle Units 3 and 4 was $244 million, $247 million, $5 million, and $611
million, respectively. Construction at Plants Miller, Wansley, and Scherer relates primarily to
environmental projects. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Nuclear
Construction  for information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Power have contracted to operate and maintain the
jointly owned facilities, except for Rocky Mountain and Intercession City, as agents for their
respective co-owners. The companies  proportionate share of their plant operating expenses is
included in the corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income and each company is
responsible for providing its own financing.

5. INCOME TAXES 

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined state income tax
returns for the States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax
allocation agreement, each subsidiary s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally
liable for the tax liability.

Current and Deferred Income Taxes 

Details of income tax provisions are as follows:

Net cash payments for income taxes in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $975 million, $537 million, and
$732 million, respectively.

The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and their respective tax bases, which give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities, are as follows:

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, Southern Company had a State of Georgia net operating loss (NOL)
carryforward totaling $1.0 billion, which could result in net state income tax benefits of $55
million, if utilized. However, Southern Company has established a valuation allowance for the
potential $55 million tax benefit due to the remote likelihood that the tax benefit will be
realized. These NOLs expire between 2010 and 2021. During 2009, Southern Company utilized
$4 million in available NOLs, which resulted in a $0.2 million state income tax benefit. The State
of Georgia allows the filing of a combined return, which should substantially reduce any additional
NOL carryforwards.

At December 31, 2009, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $1.05 billion and
$249 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

Effective Tax Rate 

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the
applicable U.S. federal statutory rate to earnings before income taxes and preferred and preference
dividends of subsidiaries, as a result of the following:

Southern Company s 2009 effective tax rate increased from 2008 primarily due to the $202 million
charge recorded for the MC Asset Recovery litigation settlement, which completed and resolved all
claims by MC Asset Recovery against Southern Company. Southern Company is currently evaluating
potential recovery of the settlement payment through various means. The degree to which any
recovery is realized will determine, in part, the final income tax treatment of the settlement
payment. The ultimate outcome of any such recovery and/or income tax treatment cannot be
determined at this time. The increase in Southern Company s effective tax rate was partially
offset by the gain on the early termination of an international leveraged lease investment and the
increase in AFUDC related to increased construction expenditures.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U. S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production
activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate
applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a
9% rate thereafter. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction.
However, Southern Company reached an agreement with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed
a closing agreement in December 2008. Therefore, in 2008, Southern Company reversed the
unrecognized tax benefit related to the calculation methodology and adjusted the deduction for all
previous years to conform to the agreement which resulted in a decrease in the 2008 deduction when
compared to the 2007 deduction. Certain aspects of the production activities deduction remain
unresolved. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the
application of the new methodology had no material effect on the Company s financial statements.

For 2009, Georgia Power donated 5,111 acres of land to the State of Georgia. In 2007, Georgia
Power donated 2,200 acres of land in the Tallulah Gorge State Park to the State of Georgia. The
estimated value of the donations lowered the effective income tax rate for the years ended December
31, 2009 and December 31, 2007.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

For 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $53 million, resulting in a
balance of $199 million as of December 31, 2009.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

The tax positions from current periods increase for 2009 relate primarily to the Georgia state tax
credits litigation, the production activities deduction tax position, and other miscellaneous
uncertain tax positions. The tax positions increase from prior
periods for 2009 relates primarily to the
production activities deduction tax position. See Note 3 under  Income Tax Matters  for additional
information.

Impact on Southern Company s effective tax rate, if recognized, is as follows:

The tax positions impacting the effective tax rate primarily relate to
Georgia state tax credit litigation at Georgia Power and the production activities deduction tax
position. See Note 3 under  Income Tax Matters  for additional information.

Accrued interest for unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

Southern Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The net amount of
interest accrued during 2009 was primarily associated with the Georgia state tax credit
litigation.

Southern Company did not accrue any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to a majority of
Southern Company s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the
next 12 months. The possible settlement of the Georgia state tax credits litigation and/or the
conclusion or settlement of state audits could impact the balances significantly. At this time, an
estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be determined.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2006.

6. FINANCING 

Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts 

Certain of the traditional operating companies have formed certain wholly-owned trust subsidiaries
for the purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments
and preferred security sales were loaned back to the applicable traditional operating company
through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $412 million, which constitute
substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are reflected in the balance sheets as
 Long-term Debt.  Such traditional operating companies each consider that the mechanisms and
obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute
a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts  payment obligations with respect
to these securities. At December 31, 2009, preferred securities of $400 million were outstanding.
See Note 1 under  Variable Interest Entities  for additional information on the accounting
treatment for these trusts and the related securities.

Securities Due Within One Year 

A summary of scheduled maturities and redemptions of securities due within one year at December 31
was as follows:

Maturities through 2014 applicable to total long-term debt are as follows: $1.1 billion in 2010;
$1.1 billion in 2011; $1.8 billion in 2012; $941 million in 2013; and $430 million in 2014.

Bank Term Loans 

Certain of the traditional operating companies have entered into bank term loan agreements. In
2008, Georgia Power borrowed $300 million under a three-year term loan agreement. In 2008, Gulf
Power borrowed $110 million under a three-year loan agreement. Mississippi Power also borrowed
$80 million under a three-year term loan agreement in 2008. The proceeds of these loans were used
to repay maturing long-term and short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

Senior Notes 

Southern Company and its subsidiaries issued a total of $2.4 billion of senior notes in 2009.
Southern Company issued $650 million, and the traditional operating companies  combined issuances
totaled $1.8 billion. The proceeds of these issuances were used to repay long-term and short-term
indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Southern Company and its subsidiaries had a total of $14.7 billion
and $12.9 billion, respectively, of senior notes outstanding. At December 31, 2009 and 2008,
Southern Company had a total of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of senior notes
outstanding.

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the traditional operating companies from public
authorities of funds derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance
pollution control and solid waste disposal facilities. The traditional operating companies have
$3.6 billion of outstanding pollution control revenue bonds and are required to make payments
sufficient for the authorities to meet principal and interest requirements of such bonds. Proceeds
from certain issuances are restricted until qualifying expenditures are incurred.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Assets Subject to Lien 

Each of Southern Company s subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate and apart from
Southern Company and its other subsidiaries. Alabama Power and Gulf Power have granted one or more
liens on certain of their respective property in connection with the issuance of certain pollution
control revenue bonds with an outstanding principal amount of $194 million. There are no
agreements or other arrangements among the subsidiary companies under which the assets of one
company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of Southern Company or
any of its other subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements 

At December 31, 2009, unused credit arrangements with banks totaled $4.8 billion, of which $1.5
billion expires during 2010, $25 million expires in 2011, and $3.2 billion expires in 2012. The
following table outlines the credit arrangements by company:

All of the credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of
the commitments or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks. Commitment fees
average approximately   1  / 2  of 1% or less for Southern Company, the traditional operating companies,
and Southern Power. Compensating balances are not legally restricted from withdrawal.

Most of the credit arrangements with banks have covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total
capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt excludes the
long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities.
At December 31, 2009, Southern Company, Southern Power, and the traditional operating companies
were each in compliance with their respective debt limit covenants.

In addition, the credit arrangements typically contain cross default provisions that would be
triggered if the borrower defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. The cross
default provisions are restricted only to the indebtedness, including any guarantee obligations, of
the company that has such credit arrangements. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are currently
in compliance with all such covenants.

A portion of the $4.8 billion unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to
the traditional operating companies  variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The amount of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds requiring liquidity support as of December 31, 2009
was approximately $1.6 billion. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, two remarketings of pollution
control revenue bonds increased the total requiring liquidity support to $1.8 billion.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power make short-term
borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of committed
bank credit arrangements. Southern Company and the traditional operating companies may also borrow
through various other arrangements with banks. The amounts of commercial paper outstanding and
included in notes payable in the balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were
$638 million and $794 million, respectively. The amounts of short-term bank loans included in
notes payable in the balance sheets at December 31, 2008 were $150 million. There were no short
term-bank loans included in notes payable in the balance sheet at December 31, 2009.

During 2009, the peak amount outstanding for short-term debt was $1.4 billion, and the average
amount outstanding was $956 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt was 0.4%
for 2009 and 2.7% for 2008.

Changes in Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries 

Each of the traditional operating companies has issued preferred and/or preference stock. The
preferred stock of Alabama Power and Mississippi Power contains a feature that allows the holders
to elect a majority of such subsidiary s board of directors if dividends are not paid for four
consecutive quarters. Because such a potential redemption-triggering event is not solely within
the control of Alabama Power and Mississippi Power, this preferred stock is presented as
 Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries  in a manner consistent with temporary equity under
applicable accounting standards. The preferred and preference stock at Georgia Power and the
preference stock at Alabama Power and Gulf Power do not contain such a provision that would allow
the holders to elect a majority of such subsidiary s board. As a result, under applicable
accounting standards, the preferred and preference stock at Georgia Power and the preference stock
at Alabama Power and Gulf Power are required to be shown as  noncontrolling interest,  separately
presented as a component of  Stockholders  Equity  on Southern Company s consolidated balance
sheets, consolidated statements of capitalization, and consolidated statements of stockholders 
equity.

Construction Program 

Southern Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total $4.9
billion in 2010, $5.3 billion in 2011, and $6.2 billion in 2012. These amounts include $271
million, $157 million, and $166 million in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively, for construction
expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel included herein under
 Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments.  The construction programs are subject to periodic review
and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous
factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections;
changes in environmental statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory
requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the
cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design
changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to
capital expenditures will be fully recovered. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase
commitments were outstanding in connection with the ongoing construction program, which includes
new facilities and capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and generation facilities,
including those to meet environmental standards. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters  
Georgia Power   Nuclear Construction  and  Retail Regulatory Matters   Integrated Coal Gasification
Combined Cycle  for additional information.

Long-Term Service Agreements 

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power have entered into Long-Term Service
Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric (GE), Alstom Power, Inc., Mitsubishi Power Systems
Americas, Inc., and Siemens AG for the purpose of securing maintenance support for the combined
cycle and combustion turbine generating facilities owned or under construction by the subsidiaries.
The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which generally includes the
cost of all labor and materials. The LTSAs are also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned
maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in each contract.

II-81 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

In general, these LTSAs are in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments under the LTSAs, which are subject to price escalation, are made at various intervals
based on actual operating hours or number of gas turbine starts of the respective units. Total
remaining payments under these agreements for facilities owned are currently estimated at
$2.4 billion over the remaining life of the agreements, which are currently estimated to range up
to 24 years. However, the LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at the option of the
purchasers.

Georgia Power has also entered into an LTSA with GE through 2014 for neutron monitoring system
parts and electronics at Plant Hatch. Total remaining payments to GE under this agreement are
currently estimated at $8 million. The contract contains cancellation provisions at the option of
Georgia Power.

Payments made under the LTSAs prior to the performance of any work are recorded as a prepayment in
the balance sheets. All work performed is capitalized or charged to expense (net of any joint
owner billings), as appropriate based on the nature of the work.

Limestone Commitments 

As part of Southern Company s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal plants, the
traditional operating companies have entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement
of limestone to be used in flue gas desulfurization equipment. Limestone contracts are structured
with tonnage minimums and maximums in order to account for fluctuations in coal burn and sulfur
content. Southern Company has a minimum contractual obligation of 7.0 million tons, equating to
approximately $295 million, through 2019. Estimated expenditures (based on minimum contracted
obligated dollars) over the next five years are $37 million in 2010, $36 million in 2011, $37
million in 2012, $38 million in 2013, and $39 million in 2014.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments 

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, Southern Company has entered
into various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil, biomass fuel, and nuclear fuel.
In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels,
and other financial commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed
volumes with prices based on various indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart
below represent estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2009.
Also, Southern Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of capacity
and electricity. Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2009 were as
follows:

* 
       
     Certain PPAs reflected in the table are accounted for as
operating leases. 

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply Southern Company s future
needs. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $160 million
in 2009, $147 million in 2008, and $144 million in 2007.

Operating Leases 

In 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a combined cycle
generating facility built at Plant Daniel for approximately $370 million. In 2003, the generating
facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), whose partners are unaffiliated with
Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease agreement with
Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties unrelated to
Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi Power comprise less than 50% of Juniper s
assets. Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related
liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. The initial lease term
ends in 2011, and the lease includes a purchase and

II-82 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

renewal option based on the cost of the facility at the inception of the lease. Mississippi Power
is required to amortize approximately 4% of the initial acquisition cost over the initial lease
term. In April 2010, 18 months prior to the end of the initial lease term, Mississippi Power must
notify Juniper if the lease will be terminated. Mississippi Power may elect to renew the lease for
10 years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for Mississippi Power to amortize an
additional 17% of the initial completion cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the
lease, at Mississippi Power s option, it may either exercise its purchase option or the facility
can be sold to a third party. If Mississippi Power does not exercise either its purchase option or
its renewal option, Mississippi Power could lose its rights to some or all of the 1,064 MWs of
capacity at that time.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73% of the acquisition cost, by
Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that Mississippi Power
does not renew the lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market value is less than the
unamortized cost of the asset. A liability of approximately $3 million, $5 million, and $7 million
for the fair market value of this residual value guarantee is included in the balance sheets as of
December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Southern Company also has other operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates.
Total operating lease expenses were $186 million, $184 million, and $187 million for 2009, 2008,
and 2007, respectively. Southern Company includes any step rents, escalations, and lease
concessions in its computation of minimum lease payments, which are recognized on a straight-line
basis over the minimum lease term.

At December 31, 2009, estimated minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases were as
follows:

For the traditional operating companies, a majority of the barge and rail car lease expenses are
recoverable through fuel cost recovery provisions. In addition to the above rental commitments,
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have obligations upon expiration of certain leases with respect to
the residual value of the leased property. These leases expire in 2010, 2011, and 2013, and the
maximum obligations are $61 million, $40 million, and $19 million, respectively. At the
termination of the leases, the lessee may either exercise its purchase option, or the property can
be sold to a third party. Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect that the fair market value of the
leased property would substantially reduce or eliminate the payments under the residual value
obligations. However, due to the recessionary economy, it is possible that the fair market value
of the leased property would not eliminate the payments under the residual value obligations on the
leases expiring in 2010.

Guarantees 

As discussed earlier in this Note under  Operating Leases,  Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and
Mississippi Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees.

8. COMMON STOCK 

Stock Issued 

In 2009, Southern Company issued 22.6 million shares of common stock for $673 million through the
Southern Investment Plan and employee and director stock plans. In addition, Southern Company
issued 19.9 million shares of common stock through at-the-market issuances pursuant to sales agency
agreements related to Southern Company s continuous equity offering program and received cash
proceeds of $613 million, net of $6 million in fees and commissions. In 2008, Southern Company
raised $474 million from the issuance of 14.1 million new common shares through the Southern
Investment Plan and employee and director stock plans.

II-83 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Shares Reserved 

At December 31, 2009, a total of 91 million shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Southern Investment Plan, the Employee Savings Plan, the Outside Directors Stock Plan, and the
Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (which includes the stock option plan discussed below).

Stock Option Plan 

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of its employees ranging
from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2009, there were 7,563 current and former
employees participating in the stock option plan, and there were 21 million shares of common stock
remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices of options granted to date have been at
the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to date become
exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the date of grant. Southern Company
generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period which
equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are eligible for retirement,
the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will expire no later than
10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern Company Board of
Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option awards, a change in
control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company s stock over a period equal to the expected term. Southern Company used
historical exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that
options granted to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock
options. The following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted
average grant-date fair value of stock options granted:

Southern Company s activity in the stock option plan for 2009 is summarized below:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2009 was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2009 as
stated above. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6 years and 5 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $100 million and
$77 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 10 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $23 million, $20 million, and $28 million, respectively, with the
related tax benefit also recognized in income of $9 million, $8 million, and $11 million,
respectively.

II-84 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007 was $9 million, $45 million, and $81 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized
by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises totaled $4 million, $17 million,
and $31 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Southern Company has a policy of issuing shares to satisfy share option exercises. Cash received
from issuances related to option exercises under the share-based payment arrangements for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $19 million, $113 million, and $195 million,
respectively.

Diluted Earnings Per Share 

For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is
attributable to outstanding options under the stock option plan. The effect of the stock options
was determined using the treasury stock method. Shares used to compute diluted earnings per share
are as follows:

The reduction in the effect of options for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 compared to
2007 is primarily due to the anti-dilutive nature of certain stock options outstanding that have an
exercise price that exceeds the average stock price of Southern Company shares in the year ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were 37.7 million
and 6.8 million stock options outstanding, respectively, that were not included in the diluted
earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive. Assuming an average stock price of
$38.01 (the highest exercise price of the anti-dilutive options outstanding), the effect of options
for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 would have increased by 3.4 million and 0.3 million
shares, respectively.

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions 

The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of its subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2009, consolidated retained earnings included $5.6 billion of undistributed
retained earnings of the subsidiaries. Southern Power s credit facility contains potential
limitations on the payment of common stock dividends; as of December 31, 2009, Southern Power was
in compliance with all such requirements.

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE 

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements
of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability
arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies  nuclear power plants. The Act
provides funds up to $12.6 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single
nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of
$375 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a
mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against
all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $117.5 million per
incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $17.5 million per
incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any
applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its ownership and
buyback interests, is $235 million and $237 million, respectively, per incident, but not more than
an aggregate of $35 million per company to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the
maximum assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at
least every five years. The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than October 29, 2013.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual
insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for
members  nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, both companies have policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL. In the event of a
loss, the amount of insurance available may not be adequate to cover property damage and other
incurred expenses.

II-85 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during
a prolonged accidental outage at a member s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage,
subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit
limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase the maximum limit allowed by NEIL, subject to
ownership limitations. Each facility has elected a 12-week deductible waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed the
accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power under the NEIL policies would be $38 million and
$50 million, respectively.

Claims resulting from terrorist acts are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to
normal policy limits). The aggregate, however, that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from
terrorist acts in any 12-month period is $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover
through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC
requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may
be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a
market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is
maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value
measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques used for fair value measurement.

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or
liabilities. 

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is
either directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of
the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If
there is little available market data, then the Company s own assumptions are the best
available information. 

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

II-86 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

As of December 31, 2009, assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
during the period, together with the level of the fair value hierarchy in which they fall, are
as follows:

(a) 
       
     Excludes receivables related to investment income, pending investment sales,
and payables related to pending investment purchases. 

Energy-related derivatives and interest rate derivatives primarily consist of
over-the-counter contracts. See Note 11 for additional information. The nuclear
decommissioning trust funds are invested in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income
securities. See Note 1 under  Nuclear Decommissioning  for additional information. The cash
equivalents and restricted cash consist of securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.  Other  represents marketable securities and certain deferred compensation funds also
invested in various marketable securities. All of these financial instruments and investments
are valued primarily using the market approach.

As of December 31, 2009, the fair value measurements of investments calculated at net asset

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The commingled funds in the nuclear decommissioning trusts invest primarily in a
diversified portfolio of investment high grade money market instruments, including, but not
limited to, commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness
with a maturity not exceeding 13 months from the date of purchase. The commingled funds will,
however, maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 90 days or less. The assets
may be longer term investment grade fixed income obligations having a maximum five year final
maturity with put features or floating rates with a reset rate date of 13 months or less. The
primary objective for the commingled funds is a high level of current income consistent with
stability of principal and liquidity.

One of the nuclear decommissioning trusts includes investments in Trust-Owned Life Insurance
(TOLI). The taxable nuclear decommissioning trust invests in the TOLI in order to minimize the
impact of taxes on the portfolio and can draw on the value of the TOLI through death proceeds,
loans against the cash surrender value, and/or the cash surrender value, subject to legal
restrictions. The amounts reported in the tables above reflect the fair value of investments
the insurer has made in relation to the TOLI agreements. The nuclear decommissioning trust does
not own the underlying investments, but the fair value of the investments approximates the cash
surrender value of the TOLI policies. The investments made by the insurer are in commingled
funds. The commingled funds primarily include investments in domestic and international equity
securities and predominantly high-quality fixed income securities. These fixed income
securities include U.S. Treasury and government agency fixed income securities, non-U.S.
government and agency fixed income securities, domestic and foreign corporate fixed income
securities, and, to some degree, mortgage and asset backed securities. The passively managed
funds seek to replicate the performance of a related index. The actively managed funds seek to
exceed the performance of a related index through security analysis and selection.

The money market funds are short-term investments of excess funds in various money market mutual
funds, which are portfolios of short-term debt securities. The money market funds are regulated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission and typically receive the highest rating from credit
rating agencies. Regulatory and rating agency requirements for money market funds include
minimum credit ratings and maximum maturities for individual securities and a maximum weighted
average portfolio maturity. Redemptions are available on a same day basis up to the full amount
of the Company s investment in the money market funds.

Changes in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 items using significant unobservable inputs
for Southern Company at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:

Unrealized losses of $3 million were included in earnings during 2009 relating to assets still held
at December 31, 2009 and are recorded in  depreciation and amortization. 

As of December 31, 2009, other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal
fair value were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2).

11. DERIVATIVES 

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are exposed to market
risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage
of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to each company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management
practices. Each company s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes
and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress
testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the
balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.

Energy-Related Derivatives 

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power enter into energy-related derivatives to
hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate
regulations, the traditional operating companies have limited exposure to market volatility in
commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. Each of the traditional operating companies
manages fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs,
through the use of financial derivative contracts. Southern Power has limited exposure to market
volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity because its long-term sales contracts
shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, Southern Power has
been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a
result of sales of uncontracted generating capacity.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
physical fixed-price or heat rate contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the
wholesale electricity market. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in gas prices, the
Company may enter into fixed-price contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant
portion of contracts are priced at market.

Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for in one of three methods:

Regulatory Hedges    Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory
hedges relate primarily to the traditional operating companies  fuel hedging programs, where
gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively,
and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and
ultimately recovered through the respective fuel cost recovery clauses. 

Cash Flow Hedges    Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges are used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other
comprehensive income (OCI) before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged
transactions are reflected in earnings. 

Not Designated    Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as
incurred. 

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial
settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric industry.
When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or
loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the
actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

II-89 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for power and natural
gas positions for Southern Company, together with the longest hedge date over which it is hedging
its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest
date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

* 
       
     Includes location basis of 2 million British thermal units (mmBtu). 

For cash flow hedges, the amounts expected to be reclassified from OCI to revenue and fuel
expense for the next 12-month period ending December 31, 2010 are immaterial.

Interest Rate Derivatives 

Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also enter into interest rate derivatives, which include
forward-starting interest rate swaps, to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives
related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize
ineffectiveness.

For cash flow hedges, the fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into
earnings at the same time the hedged transactions affect earnings.

At December 31, 2009, Southern Company had a total of $976 million notional amount of interest rate
derivatives outstanding with net fair value losses of $3 million as follows:

* 
       
     Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index (SIFMA) 

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company had realized net losses of $19 million upon
termination of certain interest rate derivatives at the same time the related debt was issued. The
effective portion of these losses has been deferred in OCI and is being amortized to interest
expense over the life of the original interest rate derivative, reflecting the period in which the
forecasted hedged transaction affects earnings.

The estimated pre-tax losses that will be reclassified from OCI to interest expense for the next
12-month period ending December 31, 2010 is $25 million. The Company has deferred gains and losses
that are expected to be amortized into earnings through 2037.

Contingent Features 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating
changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of
derivative liabilities with contingent features was $33 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no collateral posted with their derivative counterparties.
The maximum potential collateral requirement arising from the credit-risk-related contingent
features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, is $33 million. Generally, collateral may be
provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Included in these amounts are
certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company
system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.

Currently, the Company has investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to its debt.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Alabama Power Company 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Alabama Power
Company (the  Company ) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-123 to II-166) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Alabama Power Company at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

OVERVIEW 

Business Activities 

Alabama Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail and wholesale customers within its traditional service area located in the
State of Alabama in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Many factors affect the
opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s primary business of selling electricity.
These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain
energy sales given the effects of the recession, and to effectively manage and secure timely
recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth,
increasingly stringent environmental standards, fuel, capital expenditures, and restoration
following major storms. Appropriately balancing the need to recover these increasing costs with
customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future.

Key Performance Indicators 

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to customers, the
Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators include customer
satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on preferred
and preference stock. The Company s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its
customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high
reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability
indicators to evaluate the Company s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of fossil/hydro and
nuclear plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when
generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced
outages by total generation hours. The fossil/hydro 2009 Peak Season EFOR of 1.50% was better than
the target. The nuclear 2009 Peak Season EFOR of 0.14% was better than the target. Transmission
and distribution system reliability performance is measured by the frequency and duration of
outages. Performance targets for reliability are set internally based on historical performance,
expected weather conditions, and expected capital expenditures. The performance for 2009 was
better than the target for these reliability measures.

Net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock is the primary measure of the
Company s financial performance. The Company s 2009 results compared with its targets for some of
these key indicators are reflected in the following chart.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company s financial
performance. The performance achieved in 2009 reflects the continued management emphasis, as well
as the commitment shown by employees, in achieving or exceeding these key performance expectations.

Earnings 

The Company s financial performance remained strong in 2009 despite the challenges of a
recessionary economy. The Company s net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock
of $670 million in 2009 increased $54 million (8.7%) over the prior year. The increase was
primarily due to the corrective rate package providing for adjustments associated with customer
charges to certain existing rate structures effective in January 2009, a decrease in other
operations and maintenance expenses, and an increase in allowance for funds used during
construction (AFUDC) equity. The increase was partially offset by an overall decline in base rate
revenues attributable to a decline in kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales, resulting from a recessionary
economy and unfavorable weather conditions.

II-100 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock of $616 million in
2008 increased $36 million (6.3%) over the prior year. This improvement was primarily due to an
increase in retail base rate revenues resulting from an increase in rates under the Rate
Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate RSE) and the Rate Certificated New Plant (Rate CNP) for
environmental costs that took effect January 1, 2008, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating
expenses and depreciation.

The Company s 2007 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was $580 million,
representing a $62 million (11.9%) increase from the prior year. This improvement was primarily
due to an increase in retail base rate revenues resulting from an increase in rates under Rate RSE
and Rate CNP for environmental costs that took effect January 1, 2007 as well as favorable weather
conditions, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses and increased interest expense.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

A condensed income statement for the Company follows:

Operating Revenues  

Operating revenues for 2009 were $5.5 billion, reflecting a $548 million decrease from 2008. The
following table summarizes the principal factors that have affected operating revenues for the past
three years:

II-101 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Retail revenues in 2009 were $4.5 billion. These revenues decreased $365 million (7.5%) in
2009 and increased $455 million (10.3%) and $411 million (10.3%) in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
The decrease in 2009 was due to decreased fuel revenue and a decline in KWH sales, partially offset
by the corrective rate package providing for adjustments associated with customer charges to
certain existing rate structures. The increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to increases
in fuel revenue and base rate increases of 5.6% and 5.3%, respectively. See FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL    PSC Matters  herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory
Matters  for additional information. See  Energy Sales  below for a discussion of changes in the
volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.

Fuel rates billed to customers are designed to fully recover fluctuating fuel and purchased power
costs over a period of time. Fuel revenues generally have no effect on net income because they
represent the recording of revenues to offset fuel and purchased power expenses. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  herein and Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  for additional information.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of available
energy compared to the cost of the Company and Southern Company system-owned generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company service territory, and availability of Southern Company system
generation.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates include unit power sales under long-term contracts
to Florida utilities and sales to wholesale customers within the Company s service territory.
Capacity revenues under unit power sales contracts reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return
on investment, and under these contracts, energy is generally sold at variable cost. Fluctuations
in the prices of oil and natural gas, which are the primary fuel sources for unit power sales
customers, influence changes in these energy sales. However, because energy is generally sold at
variable cost, these fluctuations have a minimal effect on earnings. The amounts of long-term unit
power sales capacity revenues are scheduled to cease with the termination of the unit power sales
contract in May 2010. In June 2010, the capacity subject to the unit power sales contracts will be
utilized for retail service. As shown in the table above, unit power sales capacity revenues have
ranged from $151 million
to $160 million over the last three years. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included
in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based
rates that generally provide a margin above the Company s variable cost to produce the energy. See
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Retail Rate Adjustments  herein and Note 3 to the
financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate RSE  for additional information.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in accordance with the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In
2009, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $71.5 million primarily due to a 37.6%
decrease in price, partially offset by a 23.2% increase in KWH sales to affiliates as a result of
greater availability of the Company s generating resources because of a decrease in customer demand
within the Company s service territory. In 2008, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates
increased $164.4 million primarily due to a 62.2% increase in KWH sales to affiliates as a result
of greater availability of the Company s generating resources because of a decrease in customer
demand within the Company s service territory. In 2007, wholesale revenues from sales to
affiliates decreased $71.9 million primarily due to a 37.0% decrease in KWH sales to affiliates as
a result of lower availability of the Company s generating resources because of an increase in
customer demand within the Company s service territory.

II-102 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is generally
sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through the
Company s energy cost recovery clauses.

Other operating revenues in 2009 decreased $19.6 million (10.1%) from 2008 primarily due to a $42.5
million decrease in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities as a result of lower
gas prices. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $10.0 million in customer charges
related to late fees. In 2008, other operating revenues increased $12.4 million (6.8%) from 2007
primarily due to an $11.7 million increase in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam
facilities. In 2007, other operating revenues increased $13.5 million (8.0%) from 2006 primarily
due to a $4.0 million increase in revenues from electric property associated with pole attachment
and building rentals, a $2.6 million increase in transmission revenues, and a $2.5 million increase
in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities. Since co-generation steam revenues
are generally offset by fuel expense, these revenues did not have a significant impact on earnings
for any year reported.

Energy Sales  

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to
year. KWH sales for 2009 and the percent change by year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales in 2009 were 7.6% less
than in 2008. Energy sales were down in 2009 across major classes of customers. Residential and
commercial sales decreased 1.7% and 2.5%, respectively, due primarily to unfavorable weather and
decreased customer demand in 2009 as compared to 2008. Industrial sales decreased 15.9% during the
year as a result of decreased customer demand in all sectors, most significantly in the chemical
and primary metals sectors, due to a recessionary economy.

Retail energy sales in 2008 were 2.5% less than in 2007. Energy sales were down in 2008 across
major classes of customers. Residential and commercial sales decreased 2.6% and 1.4%,
respectively, due primarily to unfavorable weather in 2008 compared to 2007. Industrial sales
decreased 3.2% during the year primarily as a
result of decreased customer demand in the chemical and pipeline, and textiles and food sectors, as
a result of a slowing economy that worsened during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Retail energy sales in 2007 were 0.5% higher than in 2006. Energy sales in the residential and
commercial sectors led the growth with a 1.3% and a 2.8% increase, respectively, due primarily to
weather-driven increased demand. Industrial sales decreased 1.6% during the year primarily as a
result of decreased sales demand in textiles and food, primary metals, and chemical sectors.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses  

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generating units. Additionally, the Company purchases a portion of its
electricity needs from the wholesale market.

II-103 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Details of the Company s electricity generated and purchased were as follows:

* 
       
     Fuel includes fuel purchased by the Company for tolling agreements where power
is generated by the provider
and is included in purchased power when determining the average cost of purchased
power. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.1 billion in 2009, a decrease of $592.1 million
(21.8%) below the prior year costs. This decrease was the result of a $367.3 million decrease
related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased and a $224.8 million decrease in the cost of
fuel resulting from lower natural gas prices and an increase in hydro generation.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.7 billion in 2008, an increase of $521.5 million (23.7%)
above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a $560.8 million increase in the cost
of fuel, offset by a $39.3 million decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.2 billion in 2007, an increase of $101.9 million (4.9%)
above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a $70.3 million increase in the cost
of fuel and a $31.6 million increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Purchased power consists of purchases from affiliates in the Southern Company system and
non-affiliated companies. Purchased power transactions among the Company, its affiliates, and
non-affiliates will vary from period to period depending on demand and the availability and
variable production cost of generating resources at each company. In 2009, purchased power from
non-affiliates decreased $91.1 million (50.9%) due to a 34.9% decrease in the amount of energy
purchased and a 24.6% decrease in the average cost per KWH. In 2009, purchased power from
affiliates decreased $140.5 million (39.1%) due to a 31.4% decrease in the amount of energy
purchased. In 2008, the average cost of purchased power from non-affiliates increased $81.9
million (84.5%) due to a 67.9% increase in the amount of energy purchased. In 2007, purchased
power from non-affiliates decreased $27.1 million (21.8%) due to a 22.6% decrease in the amount of
energy purchased.

Coal prices continued to be influenced by worldwide demand from developing countries, as well as
increased mining and fuel transportation costs. While coal prices reached unprecedented high
levels in 2008, the recessionary economy pushed prices downward in 2009. However, the lower prices
did not fully offset the
higher priced coal already in inventory and under long-term contract. Demand for natural gas in
the United States also was affected by the recessionary economy leading to significantly lower
natural gas prices. During 2009, uranium prices continued to moderate from the highs set during
2007. Worldwide production levels increased in 2009; however, secondary supplies and inventories
were still required to meet worldwide reactor demand.

Fuel and purchased power expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel
revenues under the Company s energy cost recovery rate (Rate ECR). The Company, along with the
Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC), continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to
determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC
Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail
Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses  

In 2009, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $47.6 million (3.8%) primarily due to
an $18.1 million decrease in steam production expense related to fewer scheduled outages, a $12.9
million decrease in administrative and general expense related to reductions in employee medical
and other benefit-related expenses and in the injuries and damages reserve, a $5.5 million decrease
in customer accounts expense, and a $4.7 million decrease in customer service and information
expense.

In 2008, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $72.7 million (6.1%) primarily due to
a $27.4 million increase in steam production expense related to environmental mandates (which were
offset by revenues associated with Rate CNP environmental) and scheduled outage costs, a $22.9
million increase in nuclear production expense related to operations and scheduled outage costs,
and a $19.9 million increase in transmission and distribution expense related to overhead line
clearing costs.

In 2007, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $89.3 million (8.1%) primarily due to
a $28.5 million increase in steam production expense related to environmental mandates and
scheduled outage costs, a $19.6 million increase in transmission and distribution expense related
to overhead line clearing costs, a $19.0 million increase in administrative and general expenses
related to an increase in the expenses for the injuries and damages reserve, outside services, and
employee benefits, an $8.1 million increase in nuclear production expense related to scheduled
outage cost, and a $4.7 million increase in customer accounts expense associated with customer
service expenses.

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization increased $24.5 million (4.7%) in 2009, $48.9 million (10.4%) in
2008, and $20.5 million (4.5%) in 2007, primarily due to additions to property, plant, and
equipment related to environmental mandates (which were offset by revenues associated with Rate CNP
environmental) and transmission and distribution projects. See Note 3 to financial statements
under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate CNP  for additional information.

On June 25, 2009, the Company submitted an offer of settlement and stipulation to the FERC relating
to the 2008 depreciation study that was filed in October 2008. The settlement offer withdraws the
requests for authorization to use updated depreciation rates. In lieu of the new rates, the
Company is using those depreciation rates employed prior and up to January 1, 2009 that were
previously approved by the FERC. On September 30, 2009, the FERC issued an order approving the
settlement offer. See Note 1 to financial statements under  Depreciation and Amortization  for
additional information.

Taxes other than income taxes increased $15.8 million (5.1%) in 2009, $19.9 million (7.0%) in 2008,
and $28.4 million (11.0%) in 2007, primarily due to increases in the bases of state and municipal
public utility license taxes.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction Equity  

AFUDC equity increased $33.7 million (73.9%) in 2009, $10.1 million (28.5%) in 2008, and $17.2
million (94.1%) in 2007, primarily due to increases in construction work in progress related to
environmental mandates at generating facilities, as well as transmission, distribution, and general
plant projects compared to the prior years. See Note 1 to financial statements under  Allowance
for Funds Used During Construction  for additional information.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized  

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased $19.6 million (7.0%) in 2009 primarily due
to the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by additional capitalized interest, as a result
of increases in construction work in progress. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized,
increased $5.2 million (1.9%) in 2008 which was not material when compared to the prior year.
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased $21.5 million (8.5%) in 2007 primarily due
to higher interest rates on new issuance of long-term debt and higher interest rates on the
Company s outstanding variable rate securities.

Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Income Taxes  

Income taxes increased $16.2 million (4.4%) in 2009, primarily due to higher pre-tax income, prior
year tax return actualization, and an increase in expense related to normal tax contingencies,
partially offset by the tax benefits associated with an increase in AFUDC equity and an increase in
the federal production activities deduction.

Income taxes increased $16.6 million (4.7%) in 2008, primarily due to higher pre-tax income
partially offset by the tax benefit associated with an increase in AFUDC equity and a decrease in
expense related to normal tax contingencies.

Income taxes increased $20.9 million (6.3%) in 2007, primarily due to higher pre-tax income
partially offset by the tax benefit associated with an increase in AFUDC equity and an increase in
the federal production activities deduction.

Effects of Inflation 

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and
projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs
could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on the
Company s results of operations has not been substantial. See Note 3 to financial statements under
 Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate RSE  for additional information.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 

General 

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail and
wholesale customers within its traditional service area located in the State of Alabama in addition
to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail
customers are set by the Alabama PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for wholesale
electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are
regulated by the FERC. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically
within certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Application of Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates   Electric Utility Regulation  herein and Note 3 to the financial
statements under  FERC Matters  and  Retail Regulatory Matters  for additional information about
regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s primary business of selling
electricity. These factors include the Company s ability to maintain a constructive regulatory
environment that continues to allow for the recovery of prudently incurred costs during a time of
increasing costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining energy
sales, which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new
energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price
of electricity, the
price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the Company s service
area. Recessionary conditions have negatively impacted sales and are expected to continue to have
a negative impact, particularly on industrial and commercial customers. The timing and extent of
the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

Environmental Matters 

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Environmental Matters  for additional
information.

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including the Company, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR)
provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities.
These actions were filed concurrently with the issuance of notices of violation of the NSR
provisions to each of the

II-106 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

traditional operating companies. After the Company was dismissed from the original action,
the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against the Company in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Alabama. In the lawsuit against the Company, the EPA alleges that NSR
violations occurred at five coal-fired generating facilities operated by the Company. The civil
action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring installation of the
best available control technology at the affected units. The original action, now solely against
Georgia Power, has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been
reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between the Company and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Company s lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Company with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome could require substantial
capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be
determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. Such
expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations  

General 

The Company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning   Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2009, the Company had invested approximately $2.8 billion in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $526 million, $617 million, and $469 million for
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $136 million, $85
million, and $99 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The Company s compliance strategy
can be affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations; the cost,
availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; and the Company s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY    Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations  herein.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and
health concerns could also significantly affect the Company. Although new or revised environmental
legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the Company s operations, the full impact of
any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality 

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2009, the Company had spent approximately $2.5 billion
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are currently being
installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance with existing
regulations, and meet new requirements.

The EPA regulates ground level ozone through implementation of an eight-hour ozone air quality
standard. No area within the Company s service area is currently designated as nonattainment under
the current standard. In March 2008, however, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a more
stringent eight-hour ozone standard, and on January 6, 2010, the EPA proposed further reductions in
the standard. The EPA is expected to finalize the revised standard in August 2010 and require
state implementation plans for any nonattainment areas by December 2013. The revised eight-hour
ozone standard is expected to result in designation of new nonattainment areas within the Company s
service territory.

During 2005, the EPA s annual fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within the Company s service area. State plans for addressing the nonattainment
designations for this standard could require further reductions in SO 2  and
NO x  emissions from power plants. In September 2006, the EPA published a final rule
which increased the stringency of the 24-hour average fine particulate matter air quality standard.
The Birmingham, Alabama area has been designated as nonattainment for the 24-hour standard, and a
state implementation plan for this nonattainment area is due in December 2012.

II-108 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

On December 8, 2009, the EPA also proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality
Standard for SO 2 . The EPA is expected to finalize the revised SO 2  standard
in June 2010.

Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Alabama, are subject to the requirements of the
Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The rule calls for additional reductions of NO x 
and/or SO 2  to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. In July 2008 and December
2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued decisions invalidating
certain aspects of CAIR, but left CAIR compliance requirements in place while the EPA develops a
revised rule. The State of Alabama has completed its plan to implement CAIR, and emissions
reductions are being accomplished by the installation of emissions controls at the Company s
coal-fired facilities and/or by the purchase of emissions allowances. The EPA is expected to issue
a proposed CAIR replacement rule in July 2010.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule was finalized in July 2005, with a goal of restoring natural
visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064.
The rule involves the application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources
built between 1962 and 1977, and any additional emissions reductions necessary for each designated
area to achieve reasonable progress toward the natural conditions goal by 2018 and for each
ten-year period thereafter. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to
determine that CAIR satisfies BART requirements for SO 2  and no additional controls
beyond CAIR are anticipated to be necessary at any of the Company s facilities. The State of
Alabama has completed its implementation plans for BART compliance and other measures required to
achieve the first phase of reasonable progress.

The EPA is currently developing a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule for coal and
oil-fired electric generating units, which will likely address numerous Hazardous Air Pollutants,
including mercury. In March 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), a cap and
trade program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. In February
2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the CAMR. In a
separate proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the EPA entered into a
proposed consent decree that requires the EPA to issue a proposed MACT rule by March 16, 2011 and a
final rule by November 16, 2011.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standards, the fine particulate matter nonattainment
designations, and future revisions to CAIR, the SO 2  standard, the Clean Air Visibility
Rule, and MACT rule for the electric generating units on the Company cannot be determined at this
time and will depend on the specific provisions of the final rules, resolution of any legal
challenges, and the development and implementation of rules at the state level. However, these
additional regulations could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect
future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and
financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance
obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements discussed above. As
part of this strategy, the
Company has already installed a number of SO 2  and NO x  emissions
controls and plans to install additional controls within the next
several years to ensure continued compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

Water Quality 

In July 2004, the EPA published final regulations under the Clean Water Act to reduce impingement
and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
water intake structures. The use of cost-benefit analysis in the rule was ultimately appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 1, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA could consider
costs in arriving at its standards and in providing variances from those standards for existing
intake structures. The EPA is now in the process of revising the regulations. While the U.S.
Supreme Court s decision may ultimately result in greater flexibility for demonstrating compliance
with the standards, the full scope of the regulations will depend on further rulemaking by the EPA
and the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

On December 28, 2009, the EPA announced its determination that revision of the current effluent
guidelines for steam electric power plants is warranted and proposed a plan to adopt such revisions
by 2013. New wastewater treatment requirements are expected and may result in the installation of
additional controls on certain Company facilities. The impact of revised guidelines will depend on
the studies conducted in connection with the rulemaking, as well as the specific requirements of
the final rule, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

II-109

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Environmental Remediation 

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material
for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for
additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Environmental Matters   Environmental Remediation  for additional information.

Coal Combustion Byproducts 

The EPA is currently evaluating whether additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts is
merited under federal solid and hazardous waste laws. The EPA has collected information from the
electric utility industry on surface impoundment safety, and conducted on-site inspections at one
of the Company s facilities as part of its evaluation. The Company has a routine and robust
inspection program in place to ensure the integrity of its coal ash surface impoundments. The EPA
is expected to issue a proposal regarding additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts in
early 2010. The impact of these additional regulations on the Company will depend on the specific
provisions of the final rule and cannot be determined at this time. However, additional regulation
of coal combustion byproducts could have a significant impact on the Company s management,
beneficial use, and disposal of such byproducts and could result in significant additional
compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

Global Climate Issues  

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions, renewable energy standards, and energy efficiency standards continue to be considered in
Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by
the current Administration. On June 26, 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009
(ACES), which would impose mandatory greenhouse gas restrictions through implementation of a cap
and trade program, a renewable energy standard, and other measures, was passed by the House of
Representatives. ACES would require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions on a national basis to
a level that is 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, and 83% below 2005
levels by 2050. In addition, ACES would provide for renewable energy standards of 6% by 2012 and
20% by 2020. Similar legislation is being considered by the Senate. The financial and operational
impact of such legislation, if enacted, will depend on a variety of factors. These factors include
the specific greenhouse gas emissions limits or renewable energy requirements, the timing of
implementation of these limits or requirements, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the
level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and
commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions,
the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any),
the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and cost recovery through regulated rates. There can be
no assurance that any legislation will be enacted or as to the ultimate form of any legislation.
Additional or alternative legislation may be adopted as well.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published
a final determination, which became effective on January 14, 2010, that certain greenhouse gas
emissions from new motor vehicles endanger public health and welfare due to climate change. On
September 28, 2009, the EPA published a proposed rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from new
motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has stated that once this rule is effective, it
will cause carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to become regulated pollutants under the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) preconstruction permit program and the Title V
operating permit program, which both apply to power plants. As a result, the construction of new
facilities or the major modification of existing facilities could trigger the requirement for a PSD
permit and the installation of the best available control technology for carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases. The EPA also published a proposed rule governing how these programs would be
applied to stationary sources, including power plants, on October 27, 2009. The EPA has stated
that it expects to finalize these proposed rules in March 2010. The ultimate outcome of the
endangerment finding and these proposed rules cannot be determined at this time and will depend on
additional regulatory action and any legal challenges.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. A nonbinding agreement was announced during the most recent round of
negotiations in December 2009 that included a pledge from both developed and developing countries
to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome and impact of the international negotiations
cannot be determined at this time.

II-110 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Although the outcome of federal, state, or international initiatives cannot be determined at
this time, mandatory restrictions on the Company s greenhouse gas emissions or requirements
relating to renewable energy or energy efficiency on the federal or state level are likely to
result in significant additional compliance costs, including significant capital expenditures.
These costs could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions, and could result in the
retirement of a significant number of coal-fired generating units. Also, additional compliance
costs and costs related to unit retirements could affect results of operations, cash flows, and
financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Further, higher costs
that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity,
which could negatively impact results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In 2008, the total carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel-fired electric generating units
owned by the Company were approximately 47 million metric tons. The preliminary estimate of carbon
dioxide emissions from these units in 2009 is approximately
43 million metric tons. The level of
carbon dioxide emissions from year to year will be dependent on the level of generation and mix of
fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability of generating units.

The Company continues to evaluate its future energy and emissions profiles and is participating in
voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help develop and advance technology to
reduce emissions.

FERC Matters 

In July 2005, the Company filed two applications with the FERC for new 50-year licenses for the
Company s seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay,
Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin) and for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead developments on the Warrior
River. The FERC licenses for all of these nine projects expired in July and August 2007. Since
the FERC did not act on the Company s new license applications prior to the expiration of the
existing licenses, the FERC is required by law to issue annual licenses to the Company, under the
terms and conditions of the existing license, until action is taken on the new license
applications. The FERC issued an annual license for the Coosa developments in August 2007 and
issued an annual license for the Warrior developments in September 2007. These annual licenses
were automatically renewed in 2009 without further action by the FERC to allow the Company to
continue operation of the projects under the terms of the previous license while the FERC completes
review of the applications for new licenses.

In 2006, the Company initiated the process of developing an application to relicense the Martin
hydroelectric project located on the Tallapoosa River. The current Martin license will expire in
2013 and the application for a new license is expected to be filed with the FERC in 2011.

In 2010, the Company will initiate the process of developing an application to relicense the Holt
hydroelectric project located on the Warrior River. The current Holt license will expire on August
31, 2015, and the application for a new license is expected to be filed prior to that time.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take
over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new
licensee. The FERC may grant
relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result in additional costs to the Company.
The timing and final outcome of the Company s relicense applications cannot now be determined.

PSC Matters 

Retail Rate Adjustments  

Rate RSE 

Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar
year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% per
year and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. Retail rates remain unchanged when the retail
return on common equity is projected to be between 13.0% and 14.5%. If the Company s actual retail
return on common equity is above the allowed equity return range, customer refunds will be
required; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail
return on common equity fall below the allowed equity return range.

II-111 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

In October 2008, the Alabama PSC approved a corrective rate package, effective January 2009,
that primarily provides for adjustments associated with customer charges to certain existing rate
structures. The Company agreed to a moratorium on any increase in rates in 2009 under the Rate
RSE.

On December 1, 2009, the Company made its Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data
for calendar year 2010. The Rate RSE increase for 2010 is 3.24%, or $152 million annually, and was
effective in January 2010. The revenue adjustment under the Rate RSE is largely attributable to
the costs associated with fossil capacity which is currently dedicated to certain long-term
wholesale contracts that expire during 2010. Retail cost of service for 2010 reflects the cost for
that portion of the year in which this capacity is no longer committed to wholesale. The
termination of these long-term wholesale contracts will result in a significant decrease in unit
power sales capacity revenues. In an Alabama PSC order dated January 5, 2010, the Alabama PSC
acknowledged that a full calendar year of costs for such capacity would be reflected in the Rate
RSE calculation beginning in 2011 and thereafter. Under the terms of Rate RSE, the maximum
increase for 2011 cannot exceed 4.76%.

Rate CNP 

The Company s retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, provide for adjustments to recognize the
placing of new generating facilities into retail service and the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated power purchase agreements (PPAs) under a Rate CNP. There was no
adjustment to the Rate CNP to recover certificated PPA costs in 2007, 2008, or 2009. Effective
April 2010, Rate CNP will be reduced approximately $70 million annually, primarily due to the
expiration on May 31, 2010 of the PPA with Southern Power covering the capacity of Plant Harris
Unit 1.

Rate CNP also allows for the recovery of the Company s retail costs associated with environmental
laws, regulations, or other such mandates. The rate mechanism is based on forward looking
information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated
annually. Environmental costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital. Retail rates increased approximately 0.6% in
January 2007 and 2.4% in January 2008 due to environmental costs. In October 2008, the Company
agreed to defer collection of any increase in rates under this portion of Rate CNP, which permits
recovery of costs associated with environmental laws and regulations, from 2009 until 2010. The
deferral of the retail rate adjustments had an immaterial impact on annual cash flows, and had no
significant effect on the Company s revenues or net income. On December 1, 2009, the Company made
its Rate CNP environmental submission of projected data for calendar year 2010, resulting in an
increase to retail rates of approximately 4.3%, or an additional $195 million annually, based upon
projected billings. Under the terms of the rate mechanism, this adjustment became effective in
January 2010. The Rate CNP environmental adjustment is primarily attributable to scrubbers being
placed in service during 2010 at four of the Company s generating units. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate CNP  for further information.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates under Rate ECR approved by the Alabama PSC.
Rates are based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered
balance. The Company,
along with the Alabama PSC, will continue to monitor the over recovered fuel cost balance to
determine whether an additional adjustment to billing rates is required.

In June 2007, the Alabama PSC ordered the Company to increase its Rate ECR factor to 3.100 cents
per KWH effective with billings beginning July 2007. In October 2008, the Alabama PSC approved an
increase in the Company s Rate ECR factor to 3.983 cents per KWH effective with billings beginning
October 2008.

On June 2, 2009, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease in the Company s Rate ECR factor to 3.733
cents per KWH for billings beginning June 9, 2009. On December 1, 2009, the Alabama PSC approved a
decrease in the Company s Rate ECR factor to 2.731 cents per KWH for billings beginning January
2010 through December 2011. The Alabama PSC further approved an additional reduction in the Rate
ECR factor of 0.328 cents per KWH for the billing months of January 2010 through December 2010
resulting in a Rate ECR factor of 2.403 cents per KWH for such 12-month period. For billing months
beginning January 2012, the Rate ECR factor shall be 5.910 cents per KWH, absent a contrary order
by the Alabama PSC. Rate ECR revenues, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for
the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Accordingly, the approved decreases in the Rate ECR factor will have no significant effect on the
Company s net income, but will decrease operating cash flows related to fuel cost recovery in 2010
when compared to 2009.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had an over recovered fuel balance of approximately $199.6
million, of which approximately $22.1 million is included in deferred over recovered regulatory
clause revenues in the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2008, the

II-112 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Company had an under recovered fuel balance of approximately $305.8 million, of which
approximately $180.9 million is included in deferred under recovered regulatory clause revenues in
the balance sheets. These classifications are based on estimates, which include such factors as
weather, generation availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these
factors could have a material impact on the timing of any return of the over recovered fuel costs
or recovery of under recovered fuel costs. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail
Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  for further information.

Natural Disaster Reserve  

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for operations and
maintenance expense to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and
distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly natural disaster reserve (NDR)
charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and
maintain a target reserve balance of $75 million for future storms and is an on-going part of
customer billing. The second component of the NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any
existing deferred storm-related operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits
over a 24-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives the Company authority to record a deficit
balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent
further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per
month per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per residential customer account. The
Company has discretionary authority to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances
warrant.

In addition to the monthly NDR charge, the Company accrued $39.6 million of discretionary reserve
in 2009 resulting in an accumulated balance of approximately $75 million in the reserve for future
storms as of December 31, 2009. This reserve is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred
in the balance sheets. Effective February 2010, billings will be reduced to $0.37 per month per
non-residential customer account and $0.15 per month per residential customer account, consistent
with the Alabama PSC order to maintain the target NDR balance. The Company has fully recovered its
deferred storm costs; therefore, rates do not include the second component of the NDR charge.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance
expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, any change in revenue and
expense will not have an effect on net income but will decrease operating cash flows related to the
NDR charge in 2010 when compared to 2009.

The net effect of the changes in 2010 in the Rate ECR factor, Rate RSE, Rate CNP, and NDR will
result in an overall annual reduction in the Company s retail customers  billings of approximately
$433 million.

Steam Service  

On February 5, 2009, the Alabama PSC granted a Certificate of Abandonment of Steam Service in the
downtown area of the City of Birmingham. The order allows the Company to discontinue steam service
by the earlier of three years from May 14, 2008 or when it has no remaining steam service
customers. Currently, the Company has contractual obligations to provide steam service until 2013.
Impacts related to the abandonment of steam service are recognized in operating income and are not
material to the earnings of the Company.

Legislation  

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives, which could have a significant impact on the future cash flow
and net income of the Company. The Company s cash flow reduction to 2009 tax payments as a result
of the bonus depreciation provisions of the ARRA was approximately $104 million. On December 8,
2009, President Obama announced proposals to accelerate job growth that include an extension of the
bonus depreciation provision for the ARRA for 2010, which could have a significant impact on the
future cash flow and net income of the Company.

On October 27, 2009, Southern Company and its subsidiaries received notice that an award of $165
million had been granted, of which $65 million is available to the Company, under the ARRA grant
application for transmission and distribution automation and modernization projects pending final
negotiations. The Company continues to assess the other financial implications of the ARRA.

The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have passed separate bills related to
healthcare reform. Both bills include a provision that would make Medicare Part D subsidy
reimbursements taxable. If enacted into law, this provision could have a

II-113 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

significant negative impact on the Company s net income. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under  Other Postretirement Benefits  for additional information.

The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Income Tax Matters 

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as
defined in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The deduction is equal to
a stated percentage of qualified production activities net income. The percentage is phased in
over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate
applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. See Note 5 to the financial
statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for additional information.

Other Matters 

In accordance with accounting standards related to employers  accounting for pensions, the Company
recorded non-cash pre-tax pension income of approximately $24 million, $26 million, and $17 million
in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were $19
million, $23 million, and $27 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Such amounts are
dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plans. A portion of
pension and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on construction-related labor
charges. Pension and postretirement benefit costs are a component of the regulated rates and
generally do not have a long-term effect on net income. For more information regarding pension and
postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could
affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company s business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation
of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various
types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased
generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury and other claims for
damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law nuisance claims for
injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the
Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.
See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company s
Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation  

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Alabama PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies accounting standards which require the
financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process,
the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they
would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of
expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery
through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on the
Company s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore,

II-114 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear
decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the
Company s financial statements than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements under  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, 
significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate
recoverability of these regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines
and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative,
judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and
liabilities and could adversely impact the Company s results of operations.

Contingent Obligations  

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and
reasonably estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external
events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could
materially affect the Company s financial statements.

These events or conditions include the following:

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal
ash, control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
matters. 

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
or Alabama Department of Revenue interpretations of existing regulations. 

Identification of sites that require environmental remediation or the filing of other
complaints in which the Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party. 

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or complaints in which the
Company may be named as a defendant. 

Resolution or progression of new or existing matters through the legislative process, the
court systems, the IRS, the Alabama Department of Revenue, the FERC, or the EPA. 

Unbilled Revenues  

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including
weather, generation patterns, power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These
factors can be unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall
estimate of unbilled revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact
on the Company s results of operations.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

The Company s calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a
number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates,
expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and
other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest
and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan
assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ
from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore,
generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the
Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefits costs
and obligations.

II-115 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Key elements in determining the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit expense in
accordance with GAAP are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to
measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The
expected long-term return on postretirement benefit plan assets is based on the Company s
investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that
considers external actuarial advice. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by
applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to the Company s target
asset allocation. The Company discounts the future cash flows related to its postretirement
benefit plans using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of
market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to
expected benefit payments.

A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption would result in a $6 million or less change
in total benefit expense and a $68 million or less change in projected obligations.

New Accounting Standards 

Variable Interest Entities  

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on the consolidation of
variable interest entities, which replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for
determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an
approach that is primarily qualitative, requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requires additional disclosures about an
enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities. The Company adopted this new guidance
effective January 1, 2010, with no material impact on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

Overview 

The Company s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2009. Throughout the turmoil in
the financial markets, the Company has maintained adequate access to capital without drawing on any
of its committed bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial paper programs and
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The Company intends to continue to monitor its
access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet
future capital and liquidity needs. Market rates for committed credit have increased, and the
Company has been and expects to continue to be subject to higher costs as its existing facilities
are replaced or renewed. Total committed credit fees for the Company average less than   1  / 4  of 1% per
year. See  Sources of Capital  and  Financing Activities  herein for additional information.

The Company s investments in pension and nuclear decommissioning trust funds remained stable in
value as of December 31, 2009. The Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be
contributed to the pension trust fund is 2012. The projections of the amount vary significantly
depending on key variables, including future trust fund performance, and cannot be determined at
this time. The Company s funding obligations for the nuclear decommissioning trust are based on
the site study, and the next study is expected to be conducted in 2013.

Net cash provided from operating activities in 2009 totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of $424
million as compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income, as
previously discussed, a decrease in receivables, and an increase in other current liabilities
attributable to collections on regulatory clauses. Net cash provided from operating activities in
2008 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $30 million as compared to 2007. The increase included
additional use of funds for fossil fuel inventory and payment of operating expenses along with a
higher receivables balance as compared to 2007. This use of funds was offset by an increase in
cash from net income as previously discussed and higher depreciation expense along with a decrease
in the payments for federal taxes as compared to 2007. Net cash provided from operating activities
in 2007 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $194 million as compared to 2006. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in net income resulting from price increases, an increase in deferred
taxes, and the timing of payments related to operating expenses.

Net cash used for investing activities totaled $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.3 billion for
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, primarily due to gross property additions to utility plant of
$1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These
additions were primarily related to environmental mandates, construction of transmission and
distribution facilities, replacement of steam generation equipment, and purchases of nuclear fuel.

II-116 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Net cash used for financing activities totaled $35 million in 2009 primarily due to
redemptions of debt securities and dividends paid in excess of debt issuances and cash raised from
common stock sales. In 2008 and 2007, net cash provided from financing activities totaled $375
million and $162 million, respectively, primarily due to long-term debt issuances and cash raised
from common stock sales in excess of redemptions of securities and dividends paid. Fluctuations in
cash flow from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and securities
redeemed.

Significant balance sheet changes for 2009 include increases of $340 million in cash primarily from
collections on regulatory clauses. These cash collections correspondingly decreased current and
deferred under recovered regulatory clause revenues by $297 million and increased current and
deferred over recovered regulatory clause revenues by $204 million. Other changes include increases of $939
million in gross plant related to environmental mandates and transmission and distribution projects
and $478 million in long-term debt. In 2008, significant balance sheet changes included an
increase of $966 million in gross plant and an increase of $855 million in long-term debt,
primarily due to an increase in environmental-related equipment. Other significant balance sheet
changes in 2008 were a result of a decline in the market value of the Company s pension trust and
nuclear decommissioning trust funds, impacting the Company s other regulatory assets and
liabilities. In 2007, significant balance sheet changes included an increase of $671 million in
gross plant and an increase of $602 million in long-term debt, primarily due to an increase in
environmental-related equipment.

The Company s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 43.3%
in 2009, 42.5% in 2008, and 42.5% in 2007. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional
information.

The Company has maintained investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to debt, preferred securities, preferred stock, and preference stock. See SELECTED
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA for additional information regarding the Company s securities ratings.

Sources of Capital 

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, unsecured debt,
common stock, preferred stock, and preference stock. However, the type and timing of any
financings will depend on market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the Alabama PSC. Additionally, with
respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files registration statements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of
securities authorized by the Alabama PSC are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are
made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information. The Southern
Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company s current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets because of the Company s debt due
within one year and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source primarily to meet
scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due
to the seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various internal and external
sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $368 million of cash and
cash equivalents and $1.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, as described below. In
addition, the Company has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the capital
markets, including a commercial paper program, to meet liquidity needs.

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $1.3 billion, of which $481
million will expire at various times during 2010. $372 million of the credit facilities expiring in
2010 allow for the execution of term loans for an additional one-year period. $765 million of
credit facilities expire in 2012. A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to
provide liquidity support to the Company s variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The
amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds requiring liquidity support as of December
31, 2009 was approximately $608 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, two remarketings of
pollution control revenue bonds increased that amount to $744 million. See Note 6 to the financial
statements under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information.

II-117 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of the Company and
the other traditional operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the
Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances
for the benefit of any other traditional operating company. The obligations of each company under
these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support.

The Company had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2009, and $25 million
outstanding as of December 31, 2008.

Financing Activities 

In March 2009, the Company issued $500 million of Series 2009A 6.00% Senior Notes due March 1,
2039. The proceeds were used to repay short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate
purposes, including the Company s continuous construction program.

In June 2009, the Company incurred obligations related to the issuance of $53 million of the
Industrial Development Board of the City of Mobile, Alabama Pollution Control Revenue Bonds
(Alabama Power Barry Plant Project), First Series 2009. The proceeds were used to fund pollution
control and environmental improvement facilities at Plant Barry.

In July 2009, the Company issued 3,375,000 shares of common stock to Southern Company at $40 a
share ($135 million aggregate purchase price). The proceeds were used for general corporate
purposes.

In August 2009, the Company s $250 million Series BB Floating Rate Senior Notes due August 25, 2009
matured.

In October 2009, the Company issued 1,687,500 shares of common stock to Southern Company at $40 a
share ($67.5 million aggregate purchase price). The proceeds were used for general corporate
purposes.

In December 2009, the Company incurred obligations related to the issuance of $25.5 million of the
Industrial Development Board of the City of Mobile, Alabama Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds
(Alabama Power Barry Plant Project), Second Series 2009. The proceeds were used to fund certain
solid waste disposal facilities at Plant Barry.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual
obligations, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

Credit Rating Risk 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in
payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain
contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit
rating change to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, emissions allowances, and
energy price risk management. At December 31, 2009, the
maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at a BBB- and/or Baa3 rating were
approximately $5 million. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential collateral requirements
under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately $324 million. Included
in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more
Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment
grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or
cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the Company s ability to access
capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

Market Price Risk 

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage
of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management
practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress
testing, and sensitivity analysis.

II-118 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company enters into forward
starting interest rate swaps and other derivatives that have been designated as hedges. The
weighted average interest rate on $232 million of long-term variable interest rate exposure that
has not been hedged at January 1, 2010 was 3.0%. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change
in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized
interest expense by approximately $2.3 million at January 1, 2010. For further information, see
Note 1 to the financial statements under  Financial Instruments  and Note 11 to the financial
statements.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market and, to a lesser extent, into financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. The
Company has implemented fuel hedging programs per the guidelines of the Alabama PSC.

In addition, the Company s Rate ECR allows the recovery of specific costs associated with the sales
of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations at the Company s electric
generating facilities. Rate ECR also allows recovery of the cost of financial instruments used for
hedging market price risk up to 75% of the budgeted annual amount of natural gas purchases. The
Company may not engage in natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a rolling 42-month
window. Also, the premiums paid for natural gas financial options may not exceed 5% of the
Company s natural gas budget for that year.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

(a) 
       
     Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new
contracts entered into during the period, if any. 

The change in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the year
ended December 31, 2009 was an increase of $47.6 million, substantially all of which is due to
natural gas positions. The change is attributable to both the volume of million British thermal
units (mmBtu) and prices of natural gas. At December 31, 2009, the Company had a net hedge volume
of 37.3 million mmBtu with a weighted average contract cost approximately $1.20 per mmBtu above
market prices, and 44.5 million mmBtu at December 31, 2008 with a weighted average contract cost
approximately $2.12 per mmBtu above market prices. The majority of the natural gas hedges are
recovered through the fuel cost recovery clause.

At December 31, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge designation was
reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate to the
Company s fuel hedging program where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered
through the fuel cost recovery clause. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related
derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, are initially deferred in other comprehensive income
before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses
on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are
recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related derivative contracts recognized in income
were not material for any year presented.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy
in which they fall at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

The Company uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using
prices which are actively quoted, and thus fall into Level 2. See Note 10 to the financial
statements for further discussion on fair value measurement.

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. The Company only enters into agreements and
material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody s and
S P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Therefore, the Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
 Financial Instruments  and Note 11 to the financial statements.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $1.0 billion for 2010, $1.0
billion for 2011, and $1.1 billion for 2012. Environmental expenditures included in these
estimated amounts are $136 million, $85 million, and $99 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012,
respectively. Also included over the next three years, the Company estimates spending $653 million
on Plant Farley (including nuclear fuel), $882 million on distribution facilities,
and $481 million on transmission additions. See Note 7 to the financial statements under
 Construction Program  for additional details.

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental statutes and
regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; Alabama PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of
capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be
fully recovered. As a result of Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements, the Company has
external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs; however, the Company currently has no
additional funding requirements. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial
statements under  Nuclear Decommissioning. 

In addition to the funds required for the Company s construction program, approximately $800
million will be required by the end of 2012 for maturities of long-term debt. The Company plans to
continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower cost capital if market conditions permit.

The Company has also established an external trust fund for postretirement benefits as ordered by
the Alabama PSC. The cumulative effect of funding these items over an extended period will
diminish internally funded capital for other purposes and may require the Company to seek capital
from other sources. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred and preference
stock dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, 7, and 11
to the financial statements for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Contractual Obligations 

(a) 
       
     All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.
Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of January 1, 2010, as reflected in the
statements of capitalization. Fixed rates include, where applicable, the effects of interest rate
derivatives employed to manage interest rate risk. 

(b) 
       
     Preferred and preference stock do not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next five years only. 

(c) 
       
     For additional information, see Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements. 

(d) 
       
     The timing related to the realization of $6 million in unrecognized tax benefits and interest payments in
individual years beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated due to uncertainties in the
timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. See Note  5 to the financial statements for
additional information. 

(e) 
       
     The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operations and maintenance
expenditures. Total other operations and maintenance expenses for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $1.21
billion, $1.26 billion, and $1.19 billion, respectively. 

(f) 
       
     The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent current estimates
of total expenditures excluding those amounts related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear
fuel. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the
construction program. 

(g) 
       
     As part of the Company s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from certain of its coal plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used in flue
gas desulfurization equipment. 

(h) 
       
     Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery. Amounts reflected
have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2009. 

(i) 
       
     Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices. 

(j) 
       
     The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. The Company expects
that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust fund is 2012. The projections
of the amount vary significantly depending on key variables including future trust fund performance and
cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no amounts related to the pension trust are included in the
table. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the pension and
postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit payments will be made through
the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from the Company s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

General 

Alabama Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC
Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company,
Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
companies   the Company, Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power),
and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power), are vertically integrated utilities providing
electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a vertically integrated
utility providing electricity to retail and wholesale customers within its traditional service area
located in the State of Alabama in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern
Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets, and sells electricity at
market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost,
specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless
provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies
and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber cable services within the
Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for Southern Company s
investments in leveraged leases. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
Company s nuclear power plants, including the Company s Plant Farley.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but does
not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary beneficiary.
Certain prior years  data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions 

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
transactions. Costs for these services amounted to $325 million, $321 million, and $299 million,
during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved
by the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to
be rendered at cost by system service companies.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which the following nuclear-related
services are rendered to the
Company at cost: general executive and advisory services, general operations, management and
technical services, administrative
services including procurement, accounting, employee relations, systems and procedures services,
strategic planning and budgeting
services, and other services with respect to business and operations. Costs for these services
amounted to $183 million, $196 million, and $182 million, during 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively.

The Company jointly owns Plant Greene County with Mississippi Power. The Company has an agreement
with Mississippi Power under which the Company operates Plant Greene County, and Mississippi Power
reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of non-fuel expenses, which were $10.2 million
in 2009, $11.1 million in 2008, and $9.8 million in 2007. See Note 4 for additional information.

Southern Company s 30% ownership interest in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), which produced
synthetic fuel, was terminated in July 2006. The Company had an agreement with an indirect
subsidiary of Southern Company that provided services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company
provided certain accounting functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation
invoices, and the Company was reimbursed for its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement
totaled approximately $1.2 million

II-131 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

and $58.1 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, the Company purchased synthetic
fuel from AFP for use at several of the Company s plants. Synthetic fuel purchases totaled $6.2
million and $462.1 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company had an agreement with Southern Power under which the Company operated and maintained
Plant Harris at cost. On August 1, 2007, that agreement was terminated and replaced with a service
agreement under which the Company provides to Southern Power specifically requested services. In
2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company billed Southern Power $0.9 million, $0.9 million, and
$2.4 million, respectively, under these agreements. Under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with
Southern Power, the Company s purchased power costs from Plant Harris in 2009, 2008, and 2007
totaled $61.6 million, $63.2 million, and $66.3 million, respectively. The Company also provides
the fuel, at cost, associated with the PPA. The fuel cost recognized by the Company was $62.5
million in 2009, $119.6 million in 2008, and $108.1 million in 2007. Additionally, the Company
recorded $8.3 million of prepaid capacity expenses included in other deferred charges and other
assets in the balance sheets at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. See Note 3 under  Retail
Regulatory Matters  and Note 7 under  Purchased Power Commitments  for additional information.

Also, see Note 4 for information regarding the Company s ownership in and PPA with Southern
Electric Generating Company (SEGCO).

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power jointly enter into
various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or
through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under  Fuel Commitments  for additional
information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 

The Company is subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board in accounting
for the effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues
associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking
process.

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 relate to:

Note: 
       
     The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are as follows: 

(a) 
       
     Asset retirement and removal assets and liabilities are recorded, deferred income tax assets are recovered, and deferred tax liabilities are
amortized over the related property lives, which may range up to 50 years. Asset retirement and removal assets and liabilities will be settled and
trued up following completion of the related activities. 

(b) 
       
     Recovered over the remaining life of the original issue, which may range up to 50 years. 

(c) 
       
     Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year. This includes both vacation and banked holiday pay. 

II-132 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

(d) 
       
     Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved or accepted by the Alabama PSC over periods not exceeding five years. 

(e) 
       
     Fuel-hedging assets and liabilities are recorded over the life of the underlying hedged purchase contracts, which generally does not exceed three
years. Upon final settlement, actual costs incurred are recovered through the fuel cost recovery clause. 

(f) 
       
     Recorded as accepted by the Alabama PSC. Capitalized upon initialization of related construction projects. 

(g) 
       
     Recovered over the life of the PPA for periods up to 13 years. 

(h) 
       
     Recorded as accepted by the Alabama PSC. Mine reclamation and remediation liabilities will be settled following completion of the related activities. 

(i) 
       
     Recovered as storm restoration expenses are incurred, as approved by the Alabama PSC. 

(j) 
       
     Recovered and amortized over the average remaining service period which may range up to 14 years. See Note 2 for additional information. 

(k) 
       
     Not earning a return as offset in rate base by a corresponding asset or liability. 

In the event that a portion of the Company s operations is no longer subject to applicable
accounting rules for rate regulation, the Company would be required to write off or reclassify to
accumulated other comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to
determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets to
their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates. See Note 3
under  Retail Regulatory Matters  for additional information.

Revenues 

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Wholesale capacity revenues are
generally recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract periods. Unbilled revenues
are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased
power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual
costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause
revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through
adjustments to the billing factors. The Company continuously monitors the under/over recovered
balances and files for revised rates as required or when management deems appropriate, depending on
the rate. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  and  Retail Regulatory
Matters   Rate CNP  for additional information.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer comprises 10% or more of
revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues.

Fuel Costs 

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emissions
allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear
fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
See Note 3 under  Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs  for additional information.

Income and Other Taxes 

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with accounting standards related to the uncertainty in income taxes, the Company
recognizes tax positions that are  more likely than not  of being sustained upon examination by the
appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  for additional
information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

II-133 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling costs, which are recorded
in accordance with specific Alabama PSC orders. The Company accrues estimated nuclear refueling
outage costs in advance of the unit s next refueling outage. The refueling cycle is 18 months for
each unit. During 2009, the Company accrued $47.5 million for the applicable refueling cycles and
paid $29.6 million for an outage at Plant Farley Unit 1. There was no outage at Plant Farley Unit
2 in 2009. At December 31, 2009, the reserve balance totaled $27.1 million and is included in the
balance sheet in other regulatory liabilities.

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.2% in 2009 and 2008 and 3.1% in 2007.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates and the information
is provided to the Alabama PSC. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal,
less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions, the
applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet accounts and a gain
or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are
retired when the related property unit is retired.

On June 25, 2009, the Company submitted an offer of settlement and stipulation to the FERC relating
to the 2008 depreciation study that was filed in October 2008. The settlement offer withdraws the
requests for authorization to use updated depreciation rates. In lieu of the new rates, the
Company is using those depreciation rates employed prior and up to January 1, 2009 that were
previously approved by the FERC. On September 30, 2009, the FERC issued an order approving the
settlement offer.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal 

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset s useful life.
The Company has received accounting guidance from the Alabama PSC allowing the continued accrual of
other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are
reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company s nuclear
facility, Plant Farley. The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling retirement
obligations related to nuclear facilities as of December 31, 2009 was $490 million. In addition,
the Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites and underground storage
tanks, asbestos removal, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers. The
Company also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution
facilities and certain wireless communication towers. However, liabilities for the removal of
these assets have not been recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle
these obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to
recognize in the statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory
treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards
related to asset retirement and environmental obligations, and those reflected in rates are
recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability, as ordered by the Alabama PSC, and are
reflected in the balance sheets. See  Nuclear Decommissioning  for further information on amounts
included in rates.

II-134

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

(a) 
       
     Updated based on results from 2008 Nuclear Decommissioning Study 

Nuclear Decommissioning 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. The
Company has external trust funds (the Funds) to comply with the NRC s regulations. Use of the
Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the Funds are managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC,
and the Alabama PSC, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Funds are required to be
held by one or more trustees with an individual net worth of at least $100 million. The FERC
requires the Funds  managers to exercise the standard of care in investing that a  prudent
investor  would use in the same circumstances. The FERC regulations also require, except for
investments tied to market indices or other mutual funds, that the Funds  managers may not invest
in any securities of the utility for which it manages funds or its affiliates. While the Company
is allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds  managers, the Company is not
allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to mandate individual investment
decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated third
party managers with oversight by the Company s management. The Funds  managers are authorized,
within broad limits, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to
maximize the investment return on the Funds  investments. The Funds are invested in a
tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as
trading securities.

The Company records the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note
10. Gains and losses, whether realized, unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary, are
recorded in the regulatory liability for asset retirement obligations in the balance sheets and are
not included in net income or other comprehensive income. Fair value adjustments, realized gains,
and other-than-temporary impairment losses are determined on a specific identification basis.

At December 31, 2009, investment securities in the Funds totaled $488.4 million consisting of
equity securities of $345.6 million, debt securities of $134.3 million, and $8.5 million of other
securities. At December 31, 2008, investment securities in the Funds totaled $402.9 million
consisting of equity securities of $256.7 million, debt securities of $135.3 million, and $10.9
million of other securities. These amounts exclude receivables related to investment income and
pending investment sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases.

Sales of the securities held in the Funds resulted in cash proceeds of $243.8 million, $299.6
million, and $333.4 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, all of which were reinvested.
For 2009, fair value increases, including reinvested interest and dividends and excluding the
Funds  expenses, were $96.2 million, of which $79.9 million related to securities held in the Funds
at December 31, 2009. For 2008, fair value reductions, including reinvested interest and dividends
and excluding the Funds  expenses, were $(134.4) million. Realized gains and other-than-temporary
impairment losses were $34.6 million and $(37.2) million, respectively, in 2007. While the
investment securities held in the Funds are reported as trading securities, the Funds continue to
be managed with a long-term focus. Accordingly, all purchases and sales within the Funds are
presented separately in the statements of cash flows as investing cash flows, consistent with the
nature of and purpose for which the securities were acquired.

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over periods approved by the Alabama PSC. The NRC s minimum external funding requirements
are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a
nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. The Company has filed a plan with the NRC
designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will
provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, the accumulated provisions for decommissioning were as follows:

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of the site study year. The
estimated costs of decommissioning based on the most current study performed in 2008 for Plant
Farley was as follows:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from
service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because of changes in
the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions
used in making these estimates.

For ratemaking purposes, the Company s decommissioning costs are based on the site study.
Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5%
and a trust earnings rate of 7.0%. The next site study is expected to be conducted in 2013.

Amounts previously contributed to the external trust fund are currently projected to be adequate to
meet the decommissioning obligations. The Company will continue to provide site specific estimates
of the decommissioning costs and related projections of funds in the external trust to the Alabama
PSC and, if necessary, would seek the Alabama PSC s approval to address any changes in a manner
consistent with the NRC and other applicable requirements.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) 

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The equity component of AFUDC is not included in calculating taxable income.
All current construction costs are included in retail rates. The composite rate used to determine
the amount of AFUDC was 9.2% in 2009 and 2008 and 9.4% in 2007. AFUDC, net of income tax, as a
percent of net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was 14.9% in 2009, 9.4% in
2008, and 8.0% in 2007.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles 

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Natural Disaster Reserve 

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for operations and
maintenance expense to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and
distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly natural disaster reserve (NDR)
charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and
maintain a target reserve balance of $75 million for future storms and is an on-going part of
customer billing. The second component of the NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any
existing deferred storm-related operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits
over a 24-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives the Company authority to record a deficit
balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent
further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per
month per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per residential customer account. The
Company has discretionary authority to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances
warrant.

In addition to the monthly NDR charge, the Company accrued $39.6 million of discretionary reserve
in 2009 resulting in an accumulated balance of approximately $75 million in the reserve for future
storms as of December 31, 2009. This reserve is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred
in the balance sheets. Effective February 2010, billings will be reduced to $0.37 per month per
non-residential customer account and $0.15 per month per residential customer account, consistent
with the Alabama PSC order to maintain the target NDR balance. The Company has fully recovered its
deferred storm costs; therefore, rates do not include the second component of the NDR charge.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance
expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, any change in revenue and
expense will not have an effect on net income but will decrease operating cash flows related to the
NDR charge in 2010 when compared to 2009.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies 

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory 

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emissions allowances.
Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the Company
through fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Alabama PSC. Emissions allowances granted by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (included in  Other  or shown
separately as  Risk Management Activities ) and are measured at fair value. See Note 10 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Alabama PSC-approved
fuel hedging program. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in
net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are
recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. See Note 11 for additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
has no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2009.

II-137 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties 
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive Income 

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities 

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. See Note 6 under  Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts  for additional
information. However, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts.
Therefore, the investments in these trusts are reflected as Other Investments, and the related
loans from the trusts are included in Long-term Debt in the balance sheets.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS 

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the defined benefit plan are expected for the
year ending December 31, 2010. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension plans for
a selected group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these
non-qualified pension plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain
medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit
plans. The Company funds trusts to the extent required by the Alabama PSC and the FERC. For the
year ending December 31, 2010, postretirement trust contributions are expected to total
approximately $11 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2009 and 2008 was December 31 while the
measurement date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to accounting standards related to
defined postretirement benefit plans, the Company was required to change the measurement date for
its defined postretirement benefit plans from September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions
effective January 1, 2008 resulting in an increase in long-term liabilities of $5 million and an
increase in prepaid pension costs of approximately $11 million.

Pension Plans 

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $1.6 billion in 2009 and $1.4
billion in 2008. Changes during the plan year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15-month period
ended December 31, 2008 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were
as follows:

II-138 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $1.6 billion and $95 million, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to the
qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). In
2009, in determining the optimal asset allocation for the pension fund, the Company performed an
extensive study based on projections of both assets and liabilities over a 10-year horizon. The
primary goal of the study was to maximize plan funded status. The Company s investment policy
covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real estate, and
private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily to gain efficient exposure to the
various asset classes and as hedging tools. The Company minimizes the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk. The actual
composition of the Company s pension plan assets as of the end of the year, along with the targeted
mix of assets, is presented below:

The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Company s defined benefit pension plan is to
be broadly diversified across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after
consideration of various factors that affect the assets and liabilities of the pension plan
including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns, volatility, correlations of asset
classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and
liabilities. Because a significant portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in
nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment expectations for return and
risk. To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the
Company employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment
managers and service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent
investment practices.

Detailed below is a description of the investment strategies for each major asset category
disclosed above:

Domestic equity.   This portion of the portfolio comprises a mix of large and small
capitalization stocks with generally an equal distribution of value and growth attributes
managed both actively and through passive index approaches. 

International equity.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed with a blend of
growth stocks and value stocks with both developed and emerging market exposure. 

Fixed income.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed through an allocation to
long-dated, investment grade corporate and government bonds. 

Special situations.   Though currently unfunded, this portion of the portfolio was established
both to execute opportunistic investment strategies with the objectives of diversifying and
enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as to invest in promising
new strategies of a longer-term nature. 

Real estate investments.   Assets in this portion of the portfolio are invested in traditional
private market, equity-oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate securities. 

Private equity.   This portion of the portfolio generally consists of investments in private
partnerships that invest in private or public securities typically through privately
negotiated and/or structured transactions. Leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed
debt are examples of investment strategies within this category.

Changes in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 items in the pension plan assets valued
using significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as
follows:

The fair values presented above are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards
regarding fair value. For purposes of determining the fair value of the pension plan assets and
the appropriate level designation, management relies on information provided by the plan s trustee.
This information is reviewed and evaluated by management with changes made to the trustee
information as appropriate.

Securities for which the activity is observable on an active market or traded exchange are
categorized as Level 1. Fixed income securities classified as Level 2 are valued using matrix
pricing, a common model using observable inputs. Domestic and international equity securities
classified as Level 2 consist of pooled funds where the value is not quoted on an exchange but
where the value is determined using observable inputs from the market. Securities that are valued
using unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3 and include investments in real estate and
investments in limited partnerships. The Company invests (through the pension plan trustee)
directly in the limited partnerships which then invest in various types of funds or various private
entities within a fund. The fair value of the limited partnerships  investments is based on
audited annual capital accounts statements which are generally prepared on a fair value basis. The
Company also relies on the fact that, in most instances, the underlying assets held by the limited
partnerships are reported at fair value. External investment managers typically send valuations to
both the custodian and to the Company within 90 days of quarter end. The custodian reports the
most recent value available and adjusts the value for cash flows since the statement date for each
respective fund.

Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets related to the Company s pension plans
consist of:

Presented below are the amounts included in regulatory assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 related

The changes in the balances of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to the defined
benefit pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15 months ended December 31,
2008 are presented in the following table:

Components of net periodic pension cost (income) were as follows:

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs
netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value
of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to
amortize changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the
changes immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate
the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2009, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

million, $10.7 million, and $10.7 million, respectively, and is expected to have a similar impact
on future expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service and

Actuarial Assumptions 

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2006 for the 2007 plan year using a discount rate of 6.00% and an annual
salary increase of 3.50%.

The Company estimates the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit
plan assets using a financial model to project the expected return on each current investment
portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each of seven different asset
classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust s
target asset allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on
four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset class (based in part on historical returns), each
trust s asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact of a periodic
rebalancing of each trust s portfolio.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 8.50% for 2010, decreasing gradually to 5.25% through the year 2016 and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%
would affect the APBO and the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2009 as follows:

The Company provides an 85% matching contribution up to 6% of an employee s base salary. Total
matching contributions made to the plan for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $19 million, $18 million, and
$17 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

General Litigation Matters 

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment such as regulation of air emissions and
water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including
property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental
requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury and other claims for damages caused
by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief
and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have become more
frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot
be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.

Environmental Matters 

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, alleging
that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act
and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. These actions were filed
concurrently with the issuance of notices of violation of the NSR provisions to each of the
traditional operating companies. After the Company was dismissed from the original action, the EPA
filed a separate action in January 2001 against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Alabama. In the lawsuit against the Company, the EPA alleges that NSR
violations occurred at five coal-fired generating facilities operated by the Company. The civil
action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring installation of the
best available control technology at the affected units. The original action, now solely against
Georgia Power, has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been
reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between the Company and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Company s lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Company with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome could require substantial
capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be
determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. Such
expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the

II-148  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on lack
of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation  

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties.

FERC Matters 

Market-Based Rate Authority  

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company s generation market
power within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets was not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in
Southern Company s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended
in May 2006 could have been subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

On December 23, 2009, Southern Company and the FERC trial staff reached an agreement in principle
that would resolve the proceeding in its entirety. The agreement does not reflect any finding or
suggestion that the Company possesses or has exercised any market power. The agreement likewise
does not require the Company to make any refunds related to sales during the 15-month refund
period. Under the agreement, the Company will donate $0.6 million to nonprofit organizations in
the State of Alabama for the purpose of offsetting the electricity bills of low-income retail
customers. The agreement is subject to review and approval by the FERC.

Intercompany Interchange Contract  

The Company s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies (including the Company), Southern
Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated,
(2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC s standards of conduct applicable to
utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company s code of
conduct defining Southern Power as a  system company  rather than a  marketing affiliate  is just
and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern
Power s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company s code of
conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement s terms.
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on

II-149  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a compliance plan
in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain modifications, the
plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a material impact on
the Company s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified the FERC that the
plan had been implemented. In December 2008, the FERC division of audits issued for public comment
its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and related matters. No comments
were submitted challenging the audit report s findings of Southern Company s compliance. The
proceeding remains open pending a decision from the FERC regarding the audit report.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs 

The Company has a contract with the United States, acting through the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), that provides for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin
disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contract, and the Company is pursuing
legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.

In July 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded the Company approximately $17 million,
representing substantially all of the direct costs of the expansion of spent nuclear fuel storage
facilities at Plant Farley from 1998 through 2004. In November 2007, the government s motion for
reconsideration was denied. In January 2008, the government filed an appeal, and in February 2008,
filed a motion to stay the appeal. In April 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit granted the government s motion to stay the appeal pending the court s decisions in three
other similar cases already on appeal. Those cases were decided in August 2008. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit has left the stay of appeals in place pending the decision in an
appeal of another case involving spent nuclear fuel contracts.

In April 2008, a second claim against the government was filed for damages incurred after December
31, 2004 (the court-mandated cut-off in the original claim), due to the government s alleged
continuing breach of contract. In October 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
denied a similar request by the government to stay this proceeding. The complaint does not contain
any specific dollar amount for recovery of damages. Damages will continue to accumulate until the
issue is resolved or the storage is provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial
statements as of December 31, 2009 for either claim. The final outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time, but no material impact on net income is expected as any damage amounts
collected from the government are expected to be returned to customers.

An on-site dry spent fuel storage facility at Plant Farley is operational and can be expanded to
accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of the plant.

Retail Regulatory Matters 

Rate RSE  

Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar
year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% per
year and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. Retail rates remain unchanged when the retail
return on common equity is projected to be between 13.0% and 14.5%. If the Company s actual retail
return on common equity is above the allowed equity return range, customer refunds will be
required; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail
return on common equity fall below the allowed equity return range.

In October 2008, the Alabama PSC approved a corrective rate package, effective January 2009, that
primarily provides for adjustments associated with customer charges to certain existing rate
structures. The Company agreed to a moratorium on any increase in rates in 2009 under the Rate
RSE.

On December 1, 2009, the Company made its Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data
for calendar year 2010. The Rate RSE increase for 2010 is 3.24%, or $152 million annually, and was
effective in January 2010. The revenue adjustment under the Rate RSE is largely attributable to
the costs associated with fossil capacity which is currently dedicated to certain long-term
wholesale contracts that expire during 2010. Retail cost of service for 2010 reflects the costs
for that portion of the year in which this capacity is no longer committed to wholesale. In an
Alabama PSC order dated January 5, 2010, the Alabama PSC acknowledged that a full calendar year of
costs for these units would be reflected in the Rate RSE calculation beginning in 2011 and
thereafter. Under the terms of Rate RSE, the maximum increase for 2011 cannot exceed 4.76%.

II-150  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Rate CNP  

The Company s retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, provide for adjustments to recognize the
placing of new generating facilities into retail service and the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated PPAs under a Rate CNP. There was no adjustment to the Rate CNP to
recover certificated PPA costs in 2007, 2008, or 2009. Effective April 2010, Rate CNP will be
reduced approximately $70 million annually, primarily due to the expiration on May 31, 2010, of the
PPA with Southern Power covering the capacity of Plant Harris Unit 1.

Rate CNP also allows for the recovery of the Company s retail costs associated with environmental
laws, regulations, or other such mandates. The rate mechanism is based on forward looking
information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated
annually. Environmental costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital. Retail rates increased approximately 0.6% in
January 2007 and 2.4% in January 2008 due to environmental costs. In October 2008, the Company
agreed to defer collection of any increase in rates under this portion of Rate CNP, which permits
recovery of costs associated with environmental laws and regulations, from 2009 until 2010. The
deferral of the retail rate adjustments had an immaterial impact on annual cash flows, and had no
significant effect on the Company s revenues or net income. On December 1, 2009, the Company made
its Rate CNP environmental submission of projected data for calendar year 2010, resulting in an
increase to retail rates of approximately 4.3%, or an additional $195 million annually, based upon
projected billings. Under the terms of the rate mechanism, this adjustment became effective in
January 2010. The Rate CNP environmental adjustment is primarily attributable to scrubbers being
placed in service during 2010 at four of the Company s generating units.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates under Rate ECR approved by the Alabama PSC.
Rates are based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered
balance. The Company, along with the Alabama PSC, will continue to monitor the over recovered fuel
cost balance to determine whether an additional adjustment to billing rates is required.

In June 2007, the Alabama PSC ordered the Company to increase its Rate ECR factor to 3.100 cents
per kilowatt-hour (KWH) effective with billings beginning July 2007. In October 2008, the Alabama
PSC approved an increase in the Company s Rate ECR factor to 3.983 cents per KWH effective with
billings beginning October 2008.

On June 2, 2009, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease in the Company s Rate ECR factor to 3.733
cents per KWH for billings beginning June 9, 2009. On December 1, 2009, the Alabama PSC approved a
decrease in the Company s Rate ECR factor to 2.731 cents per KWH for billings beginning January
2010 through December 2011. The Alabama PSC further approved an additional reduction in the Rate
ECR factor of 0.328 cents per KWH for the billing months of January 2010 through December 2010
resulting in a Rate ECR factor of 2.403 cents per KWH for such 12-month period. For billing months
beginning January 2012, the Rate ECR factor shall be 5.910 cents per KWH, absent a contrary order
by the Alabama PSC. Rate ECR revenues, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for
the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Accordingly, the approved decreases in the Rate ECR factor will have no significant effect on the
Company s net income, but will decrease operating cash flows related to fuel cost recovery in 2010
when compared to 2009.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had an over recovered fuel balance of approximately
$199.6 million, of which approximately $22.1 million is included in deferred over recovered
regulatory clause revenues in the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had an
under recovered fuel balance of approximately $305.8 million, of which approximately $180.9 million
is included in deferred under recovered regulatory clause revenues in the balance sheets. These
classifications are based on estimates, which include such factors as weather, generation
availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these factors could have
a material impact on the timing of any return of the over recovered fuel costs or recovery of under
recovered fuel costs.

Natural Disaster Reserve  

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for operations and
maintenance expense to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and
distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly NDR charge to customers consisting
of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a target reserve
balance of $75 million for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. The second
component of the NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related
operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a 24-month period. The
Alabama PSC order gives the Company authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of
storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the
maximum total NDR charge consisting of

II-151  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

both components is $10 per month per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per
residential customer account. The Company has discretionary authority to accrue certain
additional amounts as circumstances warrant.

In addition to the monthly NDR charge, the Company accrued $39.6 million of discretionary reserve
in 2009 resulting in an accumulated balance of approximately $75 million in the reserve for future
storms as of December 31, 2009. This reserve is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred
in the balance sheets. Effective February 2010, billings will be reduced to $0.37 per month per
non-residential customer account and $0.15 per month per residential customer account, consistent
with the Alabama PSC order to maintain the target NDR balance. The Company has fully recovered its
deferred storm costs, therefore, rates do not include the second component of the NDR charge.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance
expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, any change in revenue and
expense will not have an effect on net income but will decrease operating cash flows related to the
NDR charge in 2010 when compared to 2009.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS 

The Company and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns
electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as well as associated
transmission facilities. The capacity of these units is sold equally to the Company and Georgia
Power under a contract which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to provide for the
operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a return on equity, whether or not SEGCO has any
capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically for two-year
periods, subject to either party s right to cancel upon two years  notice. The Company s share of
purchased power totaled $82.1 million in 2009, $124 million in 2008, and $105 million in 2007, and
is included in  Purchased power from affiliates  in the statements of income. The Company accounts
for SEGCO using the equity method.

In addition, the Company has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an
installment sale agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO s
generating units, pursuant to which $24.5 million principal amount of pollution control revenue
bonds are outstanding. Also, the Company has guaranteed $50 million principal amount of unsecured
senior notes issued by SEGCO for general corporate purposes. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse
the Company for the pro rata portion of such obligations corresponding to its then proportionate
ownership of stock of SEGCO if the Company is called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

At December 31, 2009, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $85 million of equity and
$74 million of long-term debt on which the annual interest requirement is $3.2 million. SEGCO paid
no dividends in 2009, $7.8 million in 2008, and $2.6 million in 2007, of which one-half of each was
paid to the Company. In addition, the Company recognizes 50% of SEGCO s net income.

In addition to the Company s ownership of SEGCO, the Company s percentage ownership and investment
in jointly-owned coal-fired generating plants at December 31, 2009 is as follows:

(1) 
       
     Jointly owned with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. 

(2) 
       
     Jointly owned with PowerSouth. 

At December 31, 2009, the Company s Plant Miller portion of construction work in progress was
$243.6 million.

The Company has contracted to operate and maintain the jointly owned facilities as agent for their
co-owners. The Company s proportionate share of its plant operating expenses is included in
operating expenses in the statements of income and the Company is responsible for providing its own
financing.

5. INCOME TAXES 

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined state income tax
returns for the States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax
allocation agreement, each subsidiary s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the tax liability. In addition, the Company files a separate company income
tax return for the State of Tennessee.

Current and Deferred Income Taxes 

Details of income tax provisions are as follows:

The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and
their respective tax bases, which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, are as follows:

II-153  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, the Company s tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $387 million
and $89 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years, to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates lower than the current
enacted tax law, and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the
lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $8.0
million in each of 2009, 2008, and 2007. At December 31, 2009, all investment tax credits
available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

Effective Tax Rate 

A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as
follows:

AFUDC increased in 2009 due to increases in the amount of construction work in progress related to
environmental mandates at generating facilities and transmission, distribution, and general plant
projects compared to the prior years. See Note 1 under  Allowance for Funds Used During
Construction (AFUDC)  for additional information.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U. S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production
activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate
applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a
9% rate thereafter. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction.
However, Southern Company reached an agreement with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed
a closing agreement in December 2008. Therefore, in 2008, the Company reversed the unrecognized
tax benefit related to the calculation methodology and adjusted the deduction for all previous
years to conform to the agreement which resulted in a decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared
to the 2007 deduction. Certain aspects of the production activities deduction remain unresolved.
The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the application of
the new methodology had no material effect on the Company s financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

For 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $3 million, resulting in a
balance of $6 million as of December 31, 2009.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

The tax positions from current periods increase for 2009 relate primarily to the production
activities deduction tax position and other miscellaneous uncertain tax positions. The tax
positions increase from prior periods for 2009 relates primarily to the production activities deduction tax
position. See  Effective Tax Rate  above for additional information.

II-154  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Impact on the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized, is as follows:

Accrued interest for unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

The Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The Company did not
accrue any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to a majority of
the Company s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12
months. The possible conclusion or settlement of state audits could impact the balances
significantly. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be
determined.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2006.

6. FINANCING 

Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts 

The Company has formed certain wholly-owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $206 million,
which constitute substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are reflected in the balance
sheets as Long-term Debt Payable. The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations
relating to the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts  payment obligations with respect to these
securities. At December 31, 2009, preferred securities of $200 million were outstanding. See
Note 1 under  Variable Interest Entities  for additional information on the accounting treatment
for these trusts and the related securities.

Securities Due Within One Year 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had a scheduled maturity of senior notes due within one year
totaling $100 million. At December 31, 2008, the Company had scheduled maturities and redemptions
of senior notes due within one year totaling $250 million.

Maturities of senior notes through 2014 applicable to total long-term debt are as follows:
$100 million in 2010; $200 million in 2011; $500 million in 2012; $250 million in 2013; and none in
2014.

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds or
installment purchases of solid waste disposal facilities financed by funds derived from sales by
public authorities of revenue bonds. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the
authorities to meet principal and interest requirements of such bonds. The Company incurred
obligations related to the issuance of $78.5 million of pollution control revenue bonds in 2009.
Proceeds from certain issuances are restricted until qualifying expenditures are incurred.

II-155  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Senior Notes 

The Company issued a total of $500 million of unsecured senior notes in 2009. The proceeds of
these issuances were used to repay short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate
purposes, including the Company s continuous construction program.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $4.8 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, of
senior notes outstanding. These senior notes are effectively subordinate to all secured debt of
the Company which amounted to approximately $153 million at December 31, 2009.

Preference and Common Stock 

In 2009, the Company issued no new shares of preference stock. The Company issued 5,062,500 new
shares of common stock to Southern Company at $40.00 per share and realized proceeds of
$202.5 million. The proceeds of these issuances were used for general corporate purposes.

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock 

The Company currently has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common
stock authorized and outstanding. The Company s preferred stock and Class A preferred stock,
without preference between classes, rank senior to the Company s preference stock and common stock
with respect to payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. The preferred stock
and Class A preferred stock of the Company contains a feature that allows the holders to elect a
majority of the Company s board of directors if dividends are not paid for four consecutive
quarters. Because such a potential redemption-triggering event is not solely within the control of
the Company, the preferred stock and Class A preferred stock is presented as  Redeemable Preferred
Stock  in a manner consistent with temporary equity under applicable accounting standards. The
preference stock does not contain such a provision that would allow the holders to elect a majority
of the Company s board. The Company s preference stock ranks senior to the common stock with
respect to the payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Certain series of
the preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, and preference stock are subject to redemption at the
option of the Company on or after a specified date (typically five or 10 years after the date of
issuance).

Dividend Restrictions 

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

Assets Subject to Lien 

The Company has granted liens on certain property in connection with the issuance of certain series
of pollution control revenue bonds with an outstanding principal amount of $153 million as of
December 31, 2009.

Bank Credit Arrangements 

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $1.3 billion, of which
$481 million will expire at various times during 2010, $25 million will expire in 2011, and $765
will expire in 2012. $372 million of the credit facilities expiring in 2010 allow for the
execution of one-year term loans. These credit facilities provide liquidity support to the
Company s commercial paper borrowings and $608 million are dedicated to funding purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. Subsequent to December 31,
2009, two remarketings of pollution control revenue bonds increased that amount to $744 million.

Most of the credit arrangements require payment of a commitment fee based on the unused portion of
the commitment or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks. Commitment fees average
less than   1  / 4  of 1% for the Company. Compensating balances are not legally restricted from
withdrawal.

Most of the Company s credit arrangements with banks have covenants that limit the Company s debt
to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the arrangements. For purposes of calculating these
covenants, long-term notes payable to affiliated trusts are excluded from debt but included in
capitalization. Exceeding this debt level would result in a default under the credit arrangements.
At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with the debt limit covenants. In addition,
the credit arrangements typically contain cross default provisions that would be triggered if the
Company defaulted on other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) above a specified
threshold. None of the arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of
borrowings.

II-156  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company borrows through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of committed
bank credit arrangements. In addition, the Company borrows from time to time through uncommitted
credit arrangements. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. As
of December 31, 2008, the Company had $25 million of commercial paper outstanding. During 2009 and
2008, the peak amount outstanding for short-term borrowings was $237 million and $301 million,
respectively. The average amount outstanding in 2009 and 2008 was $30 million and $40 million,
respectively. The average annual interest rate on short-term borrowings was 0.23% in 2009 and
2.31% in 2008. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the balance sheets.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had regulatory approval to have outstanding up to $2.0 billion of
short-term borrowings.

7. COMMITMENTS 

Construction Program 

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total
$1.0 billion in 2010, $1.0 billion in 2011, and $1.1 billion in 2012. These amounts include $73
million, $48 million, and $51 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively, for construction
expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel included under  Fuel
Commitments.  The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual
construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors
include: changes in business conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental
statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in
FERC rules and regulations; Alabama PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency
of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of
capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be
fully recovered. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program. The Company has no generating plants under construction.
Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and capital improvements, including
those needed to meet environmental standards for existing generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities, will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements 

The Company has entered into Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion turbine
generating facilities. The LTSAs provide that GE will perform all planned inspections on the
covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to
cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in
each contract.

In general, these LTSAs are in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments to GE, which are subject to price escalation, are made at various intervals based on
actual operating hours of the respective units. Total remaining payments to GE under these
agreements for facilities owned are currently estimated at $256 million over the remaining life of
the agreements, which are currently estimated to range up to 10 years. However, the LTSAs contain
various cancellation provisions at the option of the Company. Payments made to GE prior to the
performance of any planned maintenance are recorded as either prepayments or other deferred charges
and assets in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are capitalized or charged to expense based on
the nature of the work performed.

Limestone Commitments 

As part of the Company s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used
in flue gas desulfurization equipment. Limestone contracts are structured with tonnage minimums
and maximums in order to account for fluctuations in coal burn and sulfur content. The Company has
a minimum contractual obligation of 2.9 million tons, equating to approximately $127 million,
through 2019. Estimated expenditures (based on minimum contracted obligated dollars) over the next
five years are $11 million in 2010, $15 million in 2011, $15 million in 2012, $16 million in 2013,
and $16 million in 2014.

Fuel Commitments 

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these
contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxide emissions allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices
based on various indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent
estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2009. Total
estimated minimum long-term commitments at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the Company s future needs. Total
charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense totaled $78 million in 2009, $70 million in 2008,
and $65 million in 2007.

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent
for the Company and all of the other traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Under
these agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power may be jointly and
severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to the
creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered
into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional operating companies to
ensure the Company will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or
damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these
agreements.

Purchased Power Commitments 

The Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of capacity and energy.
Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

Certain PPAs reflected in the table are accounted for as operating leases.

II-158  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Operating Leases 

The Company has entered into rental agreements for coal rail cars, vehicles, and other equipment
with various terms and expiration dates. These expenses totaled $26.9 million in 2009,
$26.1 million in 2008, and $27.7 million in 2007. Of these amounts, $20.3 million, $19.2 million,
and $20.5 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, relate to the rail car leases and are
recoverable through the Company s Rate ECR. At December 31, 2009, estimated minimum rental
commitments for non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:

*  
       
     Total does not include payments related to a
non-affiliated PPA that is accounted for as an operating lease.
Obligations related to this agreement are included in the above
purchased power commitments table. 

In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has potential obligations upon
expiration of certain leases with respect to the residual value of the leased property. These
leases expire in 2010 and 2013, and the Company s maximum obligations are $61.2 million and
$18.6 million, respectively. At the termination of the leases, at the Company s option, the
Company may negotiate an extension, exercise its purchase option, or the property can be sold to a
third party. The Company expects that the fair market value of the leased property would
substantially eliminate the Company s payments under the residual value obligations. However, due
to the recessionary economy, it is possible that the fair market value of the leased property would
not eliminate the Company s payments under the residual value obligations on the leases expiring in
2010.

Guarantees 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding guarantees related to SEGCO s purchase of certain
pollution control facilities and issuance of senior notes, as discussed in Note 4, and to certain
residual values of leased assets as described above in  Operating Leases. 

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN 

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2009, there were 1,412 current and
former employees of the Company participating in the stock option plan and there were 21 million
shares of Southern Company common stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices
of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant.
Options granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the
date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are
eligible for retirement, the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards, a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company s stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company used historical
exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that options granted
to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock options.

II-159  

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average
grant-date fair value of stock options granted:

The Company s activity in the stock option plan for 2009 is summarized below:

The number of stock options vested and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2009 was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2009 as
stated above. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6.0 years and 4.6 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $20.8 million and
$17.1 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $1.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 11 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $3.8 million, $3.1 million, and $4.9 million, respectively, with
the related tax benefit also recognized in income of $1.4 million, $1.2 million, and $1.9 million,
respectively.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and exercise of Southern Company stock
options to the Company s employees are recognized in the Company s financial statements with a
corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007 was $1.7 million, $5.2 million, and $9.7 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit
realized by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises totaled $0.7 million,
$2.0 million, and $3.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007.

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE 

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), the Company maintains agreements of indemnity with
the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear
incident occurring at Plant Farley. The Act provides funds up to $12.6 billion for public
liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Plant Farley is insured against
this liability to a maximum of $375 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining
coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a
nuclear incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. The Company could be assessed
up to $117.5 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an
aggregate of $17.5 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such
maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for the Company is $235 million
per incident but not more than an aggregate of $35 million to be paid for each incident in any one
year. Both the maximum assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for
inflation at least every five years. The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than October
29, 2013.

II-160

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established
to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members  nuclear
generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL. In the event of a
loss, the amount of insurance available may not be adequate to cover property damage and other
incurred expenses.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during
a prolonged accidental outage at a member s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage,
subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit
limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL and has elected a 12-week deductible
waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed the
accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would be $38 million.

Claims resulting from terrorist acts are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to
normal policy limits). The aggregate, however, that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from
terrorist acts in any 12 month period is $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover
through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC
requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may
be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a
market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is
maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value
measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques used for fair value measurement.

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets
or liabilities. 

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that
is either directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions
of the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
If there is little available market data, then the Company s own assumptions are the
best available information. 

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

II-161

NOTES (continued) 
Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

As of December 31, 2009, assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
during the period, together with the level of the fair value hierarchy in which they fall, are
as follows:

(a) 
       
     Excludes receivables related to investment income, pending
investment sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases. 

Energy-related derivatives and interest rate derivatives primarily consist of
over-the-counter contracts. See Note 11 herein for additional information. The nuclear
decommissioning trust funds are invested in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income
securities. See Note 1 under  Nuclear Decommissioning  for additional information. The cash
equivalents and restricted cash consist of securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less. All of these financial instruments and investments are valued primarily using the market
approach.

As of December 31, 2009, the fair value measurements of investments calculated at net asset
value per share (or its equivalent), as well as the nature and risks of those investments, are

The nuclear decommissioning trust includes investments in Trust-Owned Life Insurance (TOLI). The
taxable nuclear decommissioning trust invests in the TOLI in order to minimize the impact of taxes
on the portfolio and can draw on the value of the TOLI via death proceeds, loans against the cash
surrender value, and/or the cash surrender value, subject to legal restrictions. The amounts
reported in the tables above reflect the fair value of investments the insurer has made in relation
to the TOLI agreements. The nuclear decommissioning trust does not own the underlying investments,
but the fair value of the investments approximates the cash surrender value of the TOLI policies.
The investments made by the insurer are in commingled funds. The commingled funds primarily
include investments in domestic and international equity securities and predominantly high-quality
fixed income securities. These fixed income securities include U.S. Treasury and government agency
fixed income securities, non-U.S. government and agency fixed income securities, domestic and
foreign corporate fixed income securities, and, to some degree, mortgage and asset backed
securities. The passively managed funds seek to replicate the performance of a related index. The
actively managed funds seek to exceed the performance of a related index through security analysis
and selection.

Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The money market funds are short-term investments of excess funds in various money market mutual
funds, which are portfolios of short-term debt securities. The money market funds are regulated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission and typically receive the highest rating from credit rating
agencies. Regulatory and rating agency requirements for money market funds include minimum credit
ratings and maximum maturities for individual securities and a maximum weighted average portfolio
maturity. Redemptions are available on a same day basis, up to the full amount of the Company s
investment in the money market funds.

As of December 31, 2009, other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal
fair value were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2).

11. DERIVATIVES 

The Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk. To
manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets its exposures, where
possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. The Company s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily
for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are
recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.

Energy-Related Derivatives 

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
manages fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of the Alabama PSC, through the use
of financial derivative contracts.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in gas prices, the Company
may enter into fixed-price contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of
contracts are priced at market.

Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for in one of three methods:

Regulatory Hedges    Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory
hedges relate primarily to the Company s fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are
initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included
in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through
the fuel cost recovery clause. 

Cash Flow Hedges    Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges are used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other
comprehensive income (OCI) before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged
transactions are reflected in earnings. 

Not Designated    Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as
incurred. 

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial
settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric industry.
When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or
loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the
actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

Alabama Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas
positions for the Company, together with the longest hedge date over which it is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest date
for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

For cash flow hedges, the amounts expected to be reclassified from OCI to revenue and fuel
expense for the next 12-month period ending December 31, 2010 are immaterial.

Interest Rate Derivatives 

The Company also enters into interest rate derivatives, which include forward-starting interest
rate swaps, to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives related to existing
variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness.

For cash flow hedges, the fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into
earnings at the same time the hedged transactions affect earnings.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges of existing debt as follows:

* 
       
     Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index
(SIFMA) 

The estimated pre-tax loss that will be reclassified from OCI to interest expense for the next
12-month period ending December 31, 2010 is $1.0 million. The Company has deferred gains and
losses that are expected to be amortized into earnings through 2035.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the pre-tax effect of interest rate
derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments on the statements of income were as
follows:

There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the pre-tax effect of energy-related
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were immaterial.

Contingent Features 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating
changes of certain affiliated companies. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of derivative
liabilities with contingent features was $7.6 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no collateral posted with its derivative counterparties;
however, because of the joint and several liability features underlying these derivatives, the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features,
at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, is $33.3 million.

Currently, the Company has investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to debt, preferred securities, preferred stock, and/or preference stock.

Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash.
The Company participated in certain
agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company system
power pool participants has a credit
rating change to below investment grade.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The management of Georgia Power Company (the  Company ) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in  Internal
Control Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Georgia Power Company 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Georgia Power
Company (the  Company ) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-196 to II-241) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Georgia Power Company at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

OVERVIEW 

Business Activities 

Georgia Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s business of selling
electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment,
to maintain energy sales given the effects of the recession, and to effectively manage and secure
timely recovery of rising costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand
growth, increasingly stringent environmental standards, and fuel prices. The Company is currently
constructing two new nuclear and three new combined cycle generating units. Appropriately
balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge
the Company for the foreseeable future. On August 27, 2009, the Georgia Public Service Commission
(PSC) approved an accounting order that allows the Company to amortize up to $324 million of its
regulatory liability related to other cost of removal obligations over the 18-month period ending
December 31, 2010 in lieu of filing a request for a base rate increase. The Company is required to
file a general base rate case by July 1, 2010. The Company filed for an adjustment to its fuel
cost recovery rate on December 15, 2009. On February 22, 2010,
the Company, the Georgia PSC Public Interest Advocacy Staff, and
three customer groups entered into a stipulation to resolve the case,
subject to approval by the Georgia PSC. A final decision by the Georgia PSC is expected on
March 11, 2010. If approved, the new fuel cost recovery rates will go into effect on April 1,
2010.

Key Performance Indicators 

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to more than two
million customers, the Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators
include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after
dividends on preferred and preference stock. The Company s financial success is directly tied to
the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include
outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer
satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the Company s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of fossil/hydro and
nuclear plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when
generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced
outages by total generation hours. The 2009 fossil/hydro Peak Season EFOR of 1.43% was better than
the target. The 2009 nuclear Peak Season EFOR of 3.70% was above the target due to an unplanned
outage at Plant Hatch. Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is measured by
the frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set internally
based on historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital expenditures.
The 2009 performance was better than the target for these reliability measures.

Net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock is the primary measure of the
Company s financial performance. The Company s 2009 results compared to its targets for some of
these key indicators are reflected in the following chart:

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company s financial
performance. The Company s net income target for 2009 was set lower than in the prior year to
reflect the economic downturn that began in late 2008; however, the global recession s impacts on
energy demand were greater than anticipated. As the recession escalated, management emphasized
stringent cost-containment efforts to partially offset the resulting revenue declines and, in lieu
of a rate increase, worked with the Georgia PSC to develop the accounting order discussed
previously. Although the Company did not meet its target, these efforts provided substantial
improvement in the Company s financial condition while consistently demonstrating the Company s
commitment to customer service, reliability, and competitive prices.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Earnings 

The Company s 2009 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock totaled $814
million representing an $88.9 million, or 9.8%, decrease from 2008. The decrease was primarily
related to lower commercial and industrial base revenues resulting from the recessionary economy
and decreased revenues from market-response rates to large commercial and industrial customers that
were partially offset by cost containment activities, increased recognition of environmental
compliance cost recovery revenues, and the amortization of the regulatory liability related to
other cost of removal activities as authorized by the Georgia PSC. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  
 PSC Matters   Rate Plans  herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory
Matters   Rate Plans  for additional information. The Company s 2008 net income after dividends on
preferred and preference stock totaled $903 million representing a $66.8 million, or 8.0%, increase
over 2007. The increase was primarily related to increased contributions from market-response
rates for large commercial and industrial customers, higher retail base revenues resulting from the
retail rate increase effective January 1, 2008 (2007 Retail Rate Plan), and increased allowance for
equity funds used during construction. These increases were partially offset by increased
depreciation and amortization resulting from more plant in service and changes to depreciation
rates. The Company s 2007 earnings totaled $836 million representing a $48.9 million, or 6.2%,
increase over 2006. Operating income increased slightly in 2007 primarily due to increased
operating revenues from transmission and outdoor lighting and decreased property taxes, partially
offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses. Net income increased primarily due to higher
allowance for equity funds used during construction and lower income tax expenses resulting from
the Company s donation of Tallulah Gorge to the State of Georgia, partially offset by higher
financing costs.

Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Operating Revenues  

Operating revenues in 2009, 2008, and 2007 and the percent of change from the prior year were as
follows:

Retail base revenues of $3.9 billion in 2009 decreased by $161.8 million, or 3.9%, from 2008
primarily due to lower industrial and commercial base revenues resulting from the recessionary
economy and decreased revenues from market-response rates to large commercial and industrial
customers. Industrial base revenues decreased $207.1 million, or 27.9%, and commercial base
revenues decreased $35.8 million, or 2.1%. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in
residential base revenues of $78.4 million, or 4.8%. All customer classes were positively affected
by increased recognition of environmental compliance cost recovery revenues. Retail base revenues
of $4.1 billion in 2008 increased by $338.3 million, or 9.0%, from 2007 primarily due to an
increase in revenues from market-response rates to large commercial and industrial customers, the
retail rate increase effective January 1, 2008, and a 0.7% increase in retail customers. The
increase was partially offset by a weak economy in the Southeast and less favorable weather impacts
in 2008 than in 2007. Retail base revenues were $3.8 billion in 2007. There was not a material
change in total retail base revenues compared to 2006, although industrial base revenues decreased
$56.5 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to lower sales and a lower contribution from market-response
rates for large commercial and industrial customers. This decrease was partially offset by a $31.8
million, or 2.1%, increase in residential base revenues as well as a $22.6 million, or 1.5%,
increase in commercial base revenues primarily due to higher sales from favorable weather and
customer growth of 1.2%. See  Energy Sales  below for a discussion of changes in the volume of
energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.

Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the
energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel
revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the fuel component of purchased power, and do not
affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  herein for
additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of
available energy compared to the cost of the Company and Southern Company system-owned generation,
demand for energy within the Southern Company service territory, and availability of Southern
Company system generation.

Revenues from unit power sales decreased $15.9 million, or 18.9%, in 2009 primarily due to a 26.0%
decrease in kilowatt-hour (KWH) energy sales due to the recessionary economy and generally
unfavorable weather. Revenues from unit power sales increased $18.2 million, or 27.4%, in 2008
driven by higher fuel rates and an 8.2% increase in the KWH energy sales primarily related to sales
by the Company s generating units when other Southern Company system units were unavailable.
Revenues from unit power sales remained relatively constant in 2007. Revenues from other
non-affiliated sales decreased by $158.3 million, or 32.7%, in 2009, increased $12.7 million, or
2.7%, in 2008, and decreased $9.6 million, or 2.0%, in 2007. The decrease in 2009 was due to lower
natural gas prices and a 49.7% decrease in KWH sales due to the recessionary economy and generally
unfavorable weather. The increase in 2008 was primarily driven by the fuel component within
non-affiliate wholesale prices which has increased with the effects of higher fuel and purchased
power costs. This increase was partially offset by a 9.8% decrease in KWH energy sales and
decreased contributions from the emissions allowance component of market-based wholesale rates.
The decrease in 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from large territorial contracts
resulting from lower emissions allowance prices.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in accordance with the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In
2009, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased 60.9% due to lower natural gas prices
and a 32.2% decrease in KWH sales due to the recessionary economy and generally unfavorable
weather. In 2008, KWH energy sales to affiliated companies decreased 28.8% while revenues from
sales to affiliates increased 3.0%. In 2007, KWH energy sales to affiliates decreased 5.0% while
revenues from sales to affiliates increased 10.0%. The revenue increases in 2008 and 2007 were
primarily due to the increased cost of fuel and other marginal generation components of the rates.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold
at marginal cost.

Other operating revenues remained relatively flat in 2009. Other operating revenues increased
$12.3 million, or 4.8%, in 2008 primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in revenues from outdoor
lighting resulting from a 15.8% increase in lighting customers and a $7.6 million increase in
customer fees resulting from higher rates that went into effect in 2008, partially offset by a $2.2
million decrease in equipment rentals revenue. Other operating revenues increased $22.2 million,
or 9.4%, in 2007 primarily due to an $11.6 million increase in transmission revenues due to the
increased usage of the Company s transmission system by non-affiliated companies, a $7.9 million
increase in revenues from outdoor lighting activities due to a 10% increase in the number of
lighting customers, and a $4.0 million increase from customer fees.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Energy Sales  

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in volume of energy sold from year to
year. KWH sales for 2009 and the percent change by year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers,
changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers.

Residential KWH sales decreased 0.5% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to slightly less
favorable weather, partially offset by an increase of 0.2% in residential customers. Commercial
and industrial KWH sales decreased 1.4% and 9.7%, respectively, in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the
recessionary economy. During 2009, there was a broad decline in demand across all industrial
segments, most significantly in the chemical, primary metals, textiles, and stone, clay, and glass
sectors.

Residential KWH sales decreased 1.6% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to less favorable
weather, partially offset by a 0.7% increase in residential customers. Commercial KWH sales
remained flat in 2008 compared to 2007 despite a 0.2% increase in commercial customers. Industrial
KWH sales decreased 5.2% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to reduced demand and closures within the
textile and primary and fabricated metal industries, which were a result of the slowing economy
that worsened during the fourth quarter 2008.

Residential KWH sales increased 2.4% in 2007 over 2006 due to favorable weather and a 1.3% increase
in residential customers. Commercial KWH sales increased 2.9% in 2007 over 2006 primarily due to
favorable weather and a 0.3% increase in commercial customers. Industrial KWH sales decreased 0.3%
primarily due to reduced demand and closures within the textile industry; however, this was
partially offset by a 2.9% increase in the number of industrial customers.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses  

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generating units. Additionally, the Company purchases a portion of its
electricity needs from the wholesale market. Details of the Company s electricity generated and
purchased were as follows:

* 
       
     Fuel includes fuel purchased by the Company for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider and
is included in purchased power when determining the average cost of purchased power. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.7 billion in 2009, a decrease of $521.7 million, or
12.4%, below prior year costs. This decrease was due to a $371.2 million decrease related to fewer
KWHs generated and purchased primarily due to lower customer demand as a result of the recessionary
economy and a $150.5 million decrease in the average cost of purchased power, partially offset by
an increase in the average cost of fuel.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.2 billion in 2008, an increase of $526.6 million, or
14.3%, above prior year costs. Substantially all of this increase was due to the higher average
cost of fuel and purchased power.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.7 billion in 2007, an increase of $312.9 million, or
9.3%, above prior year costs. This increase was driven by a $414.5 million increase in total
energy costs due to the higher average cost of fuel and purchased power, partially offset by a
$101.6 million reduction due to fewer KWHs purchased.

Coal prices continued to be influenced by worldwide demand from developing countries, as well as
increased mining and fuel transportation costs. While coal prices reached unprecedented high
levels in 2008, the recessionary economy pushed prices downward in 2009. However, the lower prices
did not fully offset the higher priced coal already in inventory and under long-term contract.
Demand for natural gas in the United States also was affected by the recessionary economy leading
to significantly lower natural gas prices. During 2009, uranium prices continued to moderate from
the highs set during 2007. Worldwide production levels increased in 2009; however, secondary
supplies and inventories were still required to meet worldwide reactor demand.

Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
Company s fuel cost recovery provisions. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Fuel Cost
Recovery  herein for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses  

In 2009, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $86.7 million, or 5.5%, compared to
2008. The decrease was due to a $46.1 million decrease in power generation, a $28.0 million
decrease in transmission and distribution, and a $31.5 million decrease in customer accounting,
service, and sales, most of which are related to cost containment activities in an effort to offset
the effects of the recessionary economy.

In 2008, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $19.2 million, or 1.2%, compared to
2007. The increase was primarily the result of a $14.7 million increase in the accrual for
property damage approved under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, a $14.6 million increase in scheduled
outages and maintenance for fossil generating plants, and a $22.0 million increase related to meter
reading, records and collections, and uncollectible account expenses. These increases were
partially offset by decreases of $24.7 million related to the timing of transmission and
distribution operations and maintenance and $7.4 million related to medical, pension, and other
employee benefits. In 2007, the change in other operations and maintenance expenses was immaterial
compared to 2006.

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization increased $18.2 million, or 2.9%, in 2009 compared to the prior year
primarily due to additional plant in service related to transmission, distribution, and
environmental projects, partially offset by the amortization of $41.4 million of the regulatory
liability related to other cost of removal obligations as authorized by the Georgia PSC. See
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Rate Plans  herein, Note 1 to the financial statements
under  Depreciation and Amortization,  and Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail
Regulatory Matters   Rate Plans  for additional information.

Depreciation and amortization increased $125.8 million, or 24.6%, in 2008 compared to the prior
year primarily due to an increase in plant in service related to completed transmission,
distribution, and environmental projects, changes in depreciation rates effective January 1, 2008
approved under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, and the expiration of amortization related to a
regulatory liability for purchased power costs under the terms of the retail rate plan for the
three years ended December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan).

Depreciation and amortization increased $12.4 million, or 2.5%, in 2007 compared to the prior year
primarily due to a 3.4% increase in plant in service related to transmission, distribution, and
environmental projects from the prior year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in
amortization of the regulatory liability for purchased power costs as described above.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes  

In 2009, the increase in taxes other than income taxes was immaterial. In 2008, taxes other than
income taxes increased $25.1 million, or 8.6%, from the prior year primarily due to higher
municipal franchise fees resulting from retail revenue increases during 2008. Taxes other than
income taxes decreased $7.7 million, or 2.6%, in 2007 primarily due to the resolution of a dispute
regarding property taxes in Monroe County, Georgia.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction Equity  

In 2009, the increase in allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) equity was
immaterial. AFUDC equity increased $27.1 million, or 39.8%, in 2008 and $36.7 million, or 116.3%,
in 2007 primarily due to the increase in construction work in progress balances related to ongoing
environmental and transmission projects, as well as three combined cycle generating units at Plant
McDonough.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized  

In 2009, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $40.5 million, or 11.7%, primarily
due to an increase in long-term debt levels resulting from the issuance of additional senior notes
and pollution control bonds to fund the Company s ongoing construction program. The increase in
interest expense in 2008 was immaterial. Interest expense increased $25.5 million, or 8.0%, in
2007 primarily due to a 13.9% increase in long-term debt levels due to the issuance of additional
senior notes and pollution control revenue bonds.

II-178

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Other Income (Expense), Net  

Other income (expense), net increased $7.5 million, or 80.8%, in 2009 primarily related to $2.0
million and $0.9 million increases in customer contracting and income resulting from purchases by
large commercial and industrial customers of hedges against market-response rates, respectively,
and a decrease of $2.4 million in donations. Other income (expense), net decreased $24.0 million,
or 163.0%, in 2008 primarily due to a $12.9 million change in classification of revenues related to
a residential pricing program to base retail revenues in 2008 as ordered by the Georgia PSC under
the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, as well as decreased revenues of $7.3 million and $2.6 million related
to non-operating rental income and customer contracting, respectively. Other income (expense), net
increased $5.8 million, or 66.5%, in 2007 primarily due to $4.0 million from land and timber sales.

Income Taxes  

Income taxes decreased $77.5 million, or 15.9%, in 2009 primarily due to lower pre-tax income.
Income taxes increased $70.0 million, or 16.8%, in 2008 primarily due to increased pre-tax net
income and the 2007 Tallulah Gorge donation. This increase was partially offset by an increase in
AFUDC equity, which is non-taxable, as well as additional state tax credits and an increase in the
federal production activities deduction. Income taxes decreased $24.8 million, or 5.6%, in 2007
primarily due to state and federal deductions for the Company s donation of 2,200 acres in the
Tallulah Gorge area to the State of Georgia and higher federal manufacturing deductions.

Effects of Inflation 

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and
projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs
could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on the
Company s results of operations has not been substantial.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 

General 

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale customers
in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by
the Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to
wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power
are regulated by the FERC. Retail rates and revenues are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically
within certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates   Electric Utility Regulation  herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under
 Retail Regulatory Matters  and  FERC Matters  for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s business of selling electricity.
These factors include the Company s ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that
continues to allow for the recovery of prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing costs.
Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining energy sales, which is
subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts
with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity,
the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the Company s service
area. Recessionary conditions have negatively impacted sales and are expected to continue to have
a negative impact, particularly to industrial and commercial customers. The timing and extent of
the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

Environmental Matters 

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. Under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, an environmental compliance cost recovery (ECCR) tariff
was implemented on January 1, 2008 to allow for the recovery of most of the costs related to
environmental controls mandated by state and federal regulation scheduled for completion between
2008 and 2010. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate
Plans  for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including the Company, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR)
provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities.
The action was filed concurrently with the issuance of a notice of violation of the NSR provisions
to the Company. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action, the EPA filed a
separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight
coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and the Company. The civil actions
request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring installation of the best
available control technology at the affected units. The original action, now solely against the
Company, has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been
reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the

II-180

defendants  conduct caused the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal
with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order
dismissing the case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations  

General 

The Company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning   Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2009, the Company had invested approximately $3.5 billion in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $440 million, $689 million, and $856 million for
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to ensure
compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $259 million, $350
million, and $600 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The Company s compliance
strategy can be affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations; the
cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; and the Company s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY    Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations  herein.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and
health concerns could also significantly affect the Company. Although new or revised environmental
legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the Company s operations, the full impact of
any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality 

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2009, the Company had spent approximately $3.2 billion
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are currently being
installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance with existing
regulations, and meet new requirements.

The EPA regulates ground level ozone through implementation of an eight-hour ozone air quality
standard. A 20-county area within metropolitan Atlanta is the only location within the Company s
service area that is currently designated as nonattainment for the standard, which could require
additional reductions in NO x  emissions from power plants. In March 2008, however, the
EPA issued a final rule establishing a more stringent eight-hour ozone standard, and on January 6,
2010, the EPA proposed further reductions in the standard. The EPA is expected to finalize the
revised standard in August 2010 and require state implementation plans for any nonattainment areas
by December 2013. The revised eight-hour ozone standard is expected to result in designation of
new nonattainment areas within the Company s service territory.

II-181 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

During 2005, the EPA s annual fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within the Company s service area. State plans for addressing the nonattainment
designations for this standard could require further reductions in SO 2  and
NO x  emissions from power plants.

On December 8, 2009, the EPA also proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard
for SO 2 . The EPA is expected to finalize the revised SO 2  standard in June
2010.

Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Georgia, are subject to the requirements of the
Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The rule calls for additional reductions of NO x 
and/or SO 2  to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. In July 2008 and December
2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued decisions invalidating
certain aspects of CAIR, but left CAIR compliance requirements in place while the EPA develops a
revised rule. The State of Georgia has completed its plan to implement CAIR, and emissions
reductions are being accomplished by the installation of emissions controls at certain of the
Company s coal-fired facilities and/or by the purchase of emissions allowances. The EPA is
expected to issue a proposed CAIR replacement rule in July 2010.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule was finalized in July 2005, with a goal of restoring natural
visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064.
The rule involves the application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources
built between 1962 and 1977, and any additional emissions reductions necessary for each designated
area to achieve reasonable progress toward the natural conditions goal by 2018 and for each
ten-year period thereafter. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to
determine that CAIR satisfies BART requirements for SO 2  and NO x , and no
additional controls beyond CAIR are anticipated to be necessary at any of the Company s facilities.
The State of Georgia is currently completing its implementation plan for BART compliance and other
measures required to achieve the first phase of reasonable progress.

The EPA is currently developing a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule for coal and
oil-fired electric generating units, which will likely address numerous Hazardous Air Pollutants,
including mercury. In March 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), a cap and
trade program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. In February
2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the CAMR. In a
separate proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the EPA entered into a
proposed consent decree that requires the EPA to issue a proposed MACT rule by March 16, 2011 and a
final rule by November 16, 2011.

In February 2004, the EPA finalized the Industrial Boiler (IB) MACT rule, which imposed limits on
hazardous air pollutants from industrial boilers, including biomass boilers. Compliance with the
final rule was scheduled to begin in September 2007; however, in response to challenges to the
final rule, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the IB MACT rule
in its entirety in July 2007 and ordered the EPA to develop a new IB MACT rule. In September 2009,
the deadline to promulgate a proposed rule was extended from July 15, 2009 to April 15, 2010, with
a final rule required by December 16, 2010. The EPA is currently developing the new rule and may
change the methodology to determine the MACT limits for industrial boilers.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standards, the fine particulate matter nonattainment
designations, and future revisions to CAIR, the SO2 standard, the Clean Air Visibility
Rule, and the MACT rules for electric generating units and industrial boilers on the Company cannot
be determined at this time and will depend on the specific provisions of the final rules,
resolution of any legal challenges, and the development and implementation of rules at the state
level. However, these additional regulations could result in significant additional compliance
costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations,
cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. As a
result of these uncertainties, the Company has delayed any further construction activities related
to both the installation of emissions control equipment at Plants Branch and Yates and the
conversion of Plant Mitchell from coal-fired to biomass-fired.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company has already installed a number of SO 2
 and NO x  emissions controls and plans to install additional controls within the
next several years to ensure continued compliance with applicable air quality requirements. In
addition, most units in Georgia are required to install specific emissions controls according to a
schedule set forth in the state s Multipollutant Rule, which is designed to reduce emissions of
SO 2 , NO x , and mercury in Georgia.

Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Water Quality 

In July 2004, the EPA published final regulations under the Clean Water Act to reduce impingement
and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
water intake structures. The use of cost-benefit analysis in the rule was ultimately appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 1, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA could consider
costs in arriving at its standards and in providing variances from those standards for existing
intake structures. The EPA is now in the process of revising the regulations. While the U.S.
Supreme Court s decision may ultimately result in greater flexibility for demonstrating compliance
with the standards, the full scope of the regulations will depend on further rulemaking by the EPA
and the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

On December 28, 2009, the EPA announced its determination that revision of the current effluent
guidelines for steam electric power plants is warranted and proposed a plan to adopt such revisions
by 2013. New wastewater treatment requirements are expected and may result in the installation of
additional controls on certain of the Company s facilities. The impact of revised guidelines will
depend on the studies conducted in connection with the rulemaking, as well as the specific
requirements of the final rule, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation 

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material
for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for
additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Environmental Matters   Environmental Remediation  for additional information.

Coal Combustion Byproducts 

The EPA is currently evaluating whether additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts is
merited under federal solid and hazardous waste laws. The EPA has collected information from the
electric utility industry on surface impoundment safety and conducted on-site inspections at two
facilities of the Company as part of its evaluation. The Company has a routine and robust
inspection program in place to ensure the integrity of its coal ash surface impoundments. The EPA
is expected to issue a proposal regarding additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts in
early 2010. The impact of these additional regulations on the Company will depend on the specific
provisions of the final rule and cannot be determined at this time. However, additional
regulations of coal combustion byproducts could have a significant impact on the Company s
management, beneficial use, and disposal of such byproducts and could result in significant
additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and
results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates. As a result of these uncertainties, the Company has delayed any further
construction activities related to both the installation of emissions control equipment at Plants
Branch and Yates and the conversion of Plant Mitchell from coal-fired to biomass-fired.

Global Climate Issues  

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions, renewable energy standards, and energy efficiency standards continue to be considered in
Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by
the current Administration. On June 26, 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009
(ACES), which would impose mandatory greenhouse gas restrictions through implementation of a cap
and trade program, a renewable energy standard, and other measures, was passed by the House of
Representatives. ACES would require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions on a national basis to
a level that is 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, and 83% below 2005
levels by 2050. In addition, ACES would provide for renewable energy standards of 6% by 2012 and
20% by 2020. Similar legislation is being considered by the Senate. The financial and operational
impact of such legislation, if enacted, will depend on a variety of factors. These factors include
the specific greenhouse gas emissions limits or renewable energy requirements, the timing of
implementation of these limits or requirements, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the
level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and
commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions,
the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any),
the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and cost recovery through regulated rates. There can be
no assurance that any legislation will be enacted or as to the ultimate form of any legislation.
Additional or alternative legislation may be adopted as well.

II-183

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published
a final determination, which became effective on January 14, 2010, that certain greenhouse gas
emissions from new motor vehicles endanger public health and welfare due to climate change. On
September 28, 2009, the EPA published a proposed rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from new
motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has stated that once this rule is effective, it
will cause carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to become regulated pollutants under the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) preconstruction permit program and the Title V
operating permit program, which both apply to power plants. As a result, the construction of new
facilities or the major modification of existing facilities could trigger the requirement for a PSD
permit and the installation of the best available control technology for carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases. The EPA also published a proposed rule governing how these programs would be
applied to stationary sources, including power plants, on October 27, 2009. The EPA has stated
that it expects to finalize these proposed rules in March 2010. The ultimate outcome of the
endangerment finding and these proposed rules cannot be determined at this time and will depend on
additional regulatory action and any legal challenges.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. A nonbinding agreement was announced during the most recent round of
negotiations in December 2009 that included a pledge from both developed and developing countries
to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome and impact of the international negotiations
cannot be determined at this time.

Although the outcome of federal, state, or international initiatives cannot be determined at this
time, mandatory restrictions on the Company s greenhouse gas emissions or requirements relating to
renewable energy or energy efficiency on the federal or state level are likely to result in
significant additional compliance costs, including significant capital expenditures. These costs
could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions, and could result in the retirement
of a significant number of coal-fired generating units. See Item 1   BUSINESS    Rate Matters  
Integrated Resource Planning  for additional information. Also, additional compliance costs and
costs related to unit retirements could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Further, higher costs that are
recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could
negatively impact results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In 2008, the total carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel-fired electric generating units
owned by the Company were approximately 57  million metric tons. The preliminary estimate of carbon
dioxide emissions from these units in 2009 is approximately 48 million metric tons. The level of
carbon dioxide emissions from year to year will be dependent on the level of generation and mix of
fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability of generating units.

The Company is actively constructing new generating facilities with lower greenhouse gas emissions.
These include two additional nuclear generating units at Plant Vogtle and three combined cycle
units at Plant McDonough.

The Company has also proposed the conversion of Plant Mitchell from coal-fired to biomass
generation and is currently evaluating the costs and viability of other renewable technologies for
the State of Georgia. On February 2, 2010, the Georgia PSC approved the Company s request to delay
construction activities related to Plant Mitchell pending the EPA s anticipated issuance of
regulations associated with coal combustion byproducts and the IB MACT rule described previously.

PSC Matters 

Rate Plans  

In December 2007, the Georgia PSC approved the 2007 Retail Rate Plan for the years 2008 through
2010. Under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, the Company s earnings are evaluated against a retail
return on common equity (ROE) range of 10.25% to 12.25%. Retail base rates increased by
approximately $100 million effective January 1, 2008 to provide for cost recovery of transmission,
distribution, generation, and other investments, as well as increased operating costs. In
addition, the ECCR tariff was implemented to allow for the recovery of costs related to
environmental projects mandated by state and federal regulations. The ECCR tariff increased rates
by approximately $222 million effective January 1, 2008.

In connection with the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, the Company agreed that it would not file for a
general base rate increase during this period unless its projected retail ROE falls below 10.25%.
The economic recession has significantly reduced the Company s revenues upon which retail rates
were set under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan. In June 2009, despite stringent efforts to reduce
expenses, the Company s projected retail ROE for both 2009 and 2010 was below 10.25%. However, in
lieu of filing to increase customer rates as

II-184 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

allowed under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, on June 29, 2009, the Company filed a request with the
Georgia PSC for an accounting order that would allow the Company to amortize up to $324 million of
its regulatory liability related to other cost of removal obligations.

On August 27, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved the accounting order. Under the terms of the
accounting order, the Company was entitled to amortize up to one-third of the regulatory liability
($108 million) in 2009, limited to the amount needed to earn no more than a 9.75% retail ROE. For
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company amortized $41 million of the regulatory liability.
In addition, the Company may amortize up to two-thirds of the regulatory liability ($216 million)
in 2010, limited to the amount needed to earn no more than a 10.15% retail ROE. The Company is
required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be
expected to determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan should be continued, modified, or
discontinued. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate
Plans  for additional information.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. The Georgia PSC
approved increases in the Company s total annual billings of approximately $383 million effective
March 1, 2007 and approximately $222 million effective June 1, 2008.

On December 15,
2009, the Company filed for a fuel cost recovery increase with the
Georgia PSC. On February 22, 2010, the Company, the Georgia PSC
Public Interest Advocacy Staff, and three customer groups entered into
a stipulation to resolve the case, subject to approval by the Georgia
PSC (the Stipulation). Under the terms of the Stipulation, the
Company s annual fuel cost recovery billings will increase by
approximately $425 million. In addition, the Company will implement
an interim fuel rider, which would allow the Company to adjust its
fuel cost recovery rates prior to the next fuel case if the under
recovered fuel balance exceeds budget by more than $75 million.
The Company is required to file its next fuel case by March 1, 2011.
The Georgia PSC is scheduled to vote on the Stipulation on March 11,
2010 with the new fuel rates to become effective April 1, 2010. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

As of
December 31, 2009, the Company s  under recovered fuel
balance totaled approximately $665
million, which if the Stipulation is approved, the Company will
recover over  32 months  beginning  April 1, 2010. Therefore,
approximately $373 million of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues for
the Company is included in deferred charges and other assets  at December
31, 2009.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, a change in
the billing factor has no significant effect on the Company s revenues or net income, but does
impact annual cash flow. See Note 1 to the financial statements under  Revenues  and Note 3 to the
financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  for additional
information.

Legislation 

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives, which could have a significant impact on the future cash flow
and net income of the Company. The Company estimates the cash flow reduction to 2009 tax payments
as a result of the bonus depreciation provisions of the ARRA to be $112 million. On December 8,
2009, President Obama announced proposals to accelerate job growth that include an extension of the
bonus depreciation provision for the ARRA for 2010, which could have a significant impact on the
future cash flow and net income of the Company.

On October 27, 2009, Southern Company and its subsidiaries received notice that an award of $165
million had been granted, of which $51 million is available to the Company, under the ARRA grant
application for transmission and distribution automation and modernization projects pending final
negotiations. The Company continues to assess the other financial implications of the ARRA.

The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have passed separate bills related to
healthcare reform. Both bills include a provision that would make Medicare Part D subsidy
reimbursements taxable. If enacted into law, this provision could have a significant negative
impact on the Company s net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under  Other
Postretirement Benefits  for additional information.

The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Income Tax Matters 

Georgia State Income Tax Credits  

The Company s 2005 through 2008 income tax filings for the State of Georgia include state income
tax credits for increased activity through Georgia ports. The Company has also filed similar
claims for the years 2002 through 2004. The Georgia Department of

II-185 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Revenue (DOR) has not responded to these claims. In July 2007, the Company filed a complaint in
the Superior Court of Fulton County to recover the credits claimed for the years 2002 through 2004.
An unrecognized tax benefit has been recorded related to these credits. See Note 5 to the
financial statements under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  for additional information. If the Company
prevails, these claims could have a significant, and possibly material, positive effect on the
Company s net income. If the Company is not successful, payment of the related state tax could
have a significant, and possibly material, negative effect on the Company s cash flow. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction  

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production activities net
income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to
the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate
thereafter. See Note 5 to the financial statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for additional
information.

Construction 

Nuclear  

On August 26, 2009, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued an Early Site Permit and Limited
Work Authorization to Southern Nuclear, on behalf of the Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, the
Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, and the City of Dalton, Georgia, an incorporated
municipality in the State of Georgia acting by and through its Board of Water, Light, and Sinking
Fund Commissioners (collectively, Owners), related to two additional nuclear units on the site of
Plant Vogtle (Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4). See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional
information on these co-owners. In March 2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC
for a combined construction and operating license (COL) for the new units. If licensed by the NRC,
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are scheduled to be placed in service in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

In April 2008, the Company, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium
consisting of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (Westinghouse) and Stone   Webster, Inc.
(collectively, Consortium) entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement to
design, engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units with electric generating
capacity of approximately 1,100 megawatts each and related facilities, structures, and improvements
at Plant Vogtle (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement).

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is an arrangement whereby the Consortium supplies and constructs the
entire facility with the exception of certain items provided by the Owners. Under the terms of the
Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Owners agreed to pay a purchase price that will be subject to certain
price escalations and adjustments, including certain index-based adjustments, as well as
adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses for early completion and unit performance.
Each Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its
ownership interest, of all amounts owed to the Consortium under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. The
Company s proportionate share is 45.7%.

On
February 23, 2010, the Company, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and the
Consortium entered into an amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. The amendment, which is
subject to the approval of the Georgia PSC, replaces certain of the index-based adjustments to the
purchase price with fixed escalation amounts.

The Owners and the Consortium have agreed to certain liquidated damages upon the Consortium s
failure to comply with the schedule and performance guarantees. The Consortium s liability to the
Owners for schedule and performance liquidated damages and warranty claims is subject to a cap.

Certain payment obligations of Westinghouse and Stone   Webster, Inc. under the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement are guaranteed by Toshiba Corporation and The Shaw Group, Inc., respectively. In the
event of certain credit rating downgrades of any Owner, such Owner will be required to provide a
letter of credit or other credit enhancement.

The Owners may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided
that the Owners will be required to pay certain termination costs and, at certain stages of the
work, cancellation fees to the Consortium. The Consortium may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement under certain circumstances, including delays in receipt of the COL or delivery of full
notice to proceed, certain Owner suspension or delays of work, action by a governmental authority
to permanently stop work, certain breaches of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement by the Owners, Owner
insolvency, and certain other events.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

On March 17, 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at
an in-service cost of $6.4 billion. In addition, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the inclusion of
the related construction work in progress accounts in rate base.

On April 21, 2009 the Governor of the State of Georgia signed into law the Georgia Nuclear Energy
Financing Act that will allow the Company to recover financing costs for nuclear construction
projects by including the related construction work in progress accounts in rate base during the
construction period. The cost recovery provisions will become effective on January 1, 2011. With
respect to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, this legislation allows the Company to recover projected
financing costs of approximately $1.7 billion during the construction period beginning in 2011,
which reduces the projected in-service cost to approximately $4.4 billion.

On June 15, 2009, an environmental group filed a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia seeking review of the Georgia PSC s certification order and challenging the
constitutionality of the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act. The Company believes there is no
meritorious basis for this petition and intends to vigorously defend against the requested actions.

On August 27, 2009, the NRC issued letters to Westinghouse revising the review schedules needed to
certify the AP1000 standard design for new reactors and expressing concerns related to the
availability of adequate information and the shield building design. The shield building protects
the containment and provides structural support to the containment cooling water supply. The
Company is continuing to work with Westinghouse and the NRC to resolve these concerns. Any
possible delays in the AP1000 design certification schedule, including those addressed by the NRC
in their letters, are not currently expected to affect the projected commercial operation dates for
Plant Vogtle Units 3  
and 4.

There are pending technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Similar additional challenges at the state and federal level are expected as
construction proceeds.

On August 31, 2009, the Company filed with the Georgia PSC its first semi-annual construction
monitoring report for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for the period ended June 30, 2009 which did not
include any proposed change to the estimated construction cost as certified by the Georgia PSC in
March 2009. On February 25, 2010, the Georgia PSC approved the expenditures made by the Company
pursuant to the certification through June 30, 2009. The Georgia PSC also ordered that in its
future semi-annual construction monitoring reports, the Company will report against a total
certified cost of approximately $6.1 billion, which is the effective certified amount after giving
effect to the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act as described above. The Company will continue
to file construction monitoring reports by February 28 and August 31 of each year during the
construction period.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Other Construction  

On August 10, 2009, the Company filed its quarterly construction monitoring report for Plant
McDonough Units 4, 5, and 6 for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. On September 30, 2009, the
Company amended the report. As amended, the report includes a request for an increase in the
certified costs to construct Plant McDonough. The Georgia PSC held a hearing in December 2009 and
is scheduled to render its decision on March 16, 2010. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
be determined at this time.

Other Matters 

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and certain
tax-related issues that could affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to
certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company s
business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and
the environment, such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury,
common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air
and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury and other claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and
common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas and other emissions, have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or
potential litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current
proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities,
if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial statements. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding material
issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following
critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company s Board of
Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation  

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies accounting standards which require the
financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process,
the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they
would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of
expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery
through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on the
Company s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear
decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the
Company s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities
have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and
liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could
materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact
the Company s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations  

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and
reasonably estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external
events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could
materially affect the Company s financial statements. These events or conditions include the
following:

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances, hazardous and
solid wastes, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash, and other environmental
matters. 

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in IRS or Georgia DOR interpretations
of existing regulations. 

Identification of additional sites that require environmental remediation or the filing of
other complaints in which the Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party. 

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or complaints in which the Company may
be named as a defendant. 

Resolution or progression of new or existing matters through the legislative process, the
court systems, the IRS, the Georgia DOR, the FERC, or the EPA.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Unbilled Revenues  

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be unpredictable
and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could
be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company s results of
operations.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

The Company s calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a
number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates,
expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and
other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest
and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan
assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ
from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore,
generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the
Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefits costs
and obligations.

Key elements in determining the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit expense in
accordance with GAAP are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to
measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The
expected long-term return on postretirement benefit plan assets is based on the Company s
investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that
considers external actuarial advice. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by
applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to the Company s target
asset allocation. The Company discounts the future cash flows related to its postretirement
benefit plans using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of
market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to
expected benefit payments.

A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption would result in an $8 million or less change
in total benefit expense and a $104 million or less change in projected obligations.

New Accounting Standards 

Variable Interest Entities  

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on the consolidation of
variable interest entities, which replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for
determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an
approach that is primarily qualitative, requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requires additional disclosures about an
enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities. The Company adopted this new guidance
effective January 1, 2010, with no material impact on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

Overview 

The Company s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2009. Throughout the turmoil in
the financial markets, the Company has maintained adequate access to capital without drawing on any
of its committed bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial paper programs and
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The Company intends to continue to monitor its
access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet
future capital and liquidity needs. Market rates for committed credit increased in 2009, and the
Company may continue to be subject to higher costs as its existing facilities are replaced or
renewed. Total committed credit fees for the Company average less than   3 /  8  of 1% per year. See
 Sources of Capital  and  Financing Activities  herein for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s investments in pension and nuclear decommissioning trust funds remained stable in
value as of December 31, 2009. The Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be
contributed to the pension trust fund is 2012 and such contribution could be significant; however,
projections of the amount vary significantly depending on key variables including future fund
performance and cannot be determined at this time. Any changes to funding obligations to the
nuclear decommissioning trusts will be determined in connection with the Company s 2010 retail rate
case and are not currently expected to be material.

Cash flow from operations totaled $1.4 billion in 2009, a decrease of $310 million from 2008,
primarily due to an $89 million decrease in net income, a reduction in deferred revenues of
approximately $172 million, a reduction in accrued compensation of approximately $122 million, and
an increase in fuel inventory additions of approximately $150 million, partially offset by a
reduction in accounts receivable of approximately $210 million. Cash flow from operations totaled
$1.7 billion in 2008, an increase of $279 million from 2007, primarily due to higher retail
operating revenues partially offset by higher inventory additions. Cash flow from operations in
2007 totaled $1.4 billion, an increase of $249 million from 2006, primarily due to higher retail
revenues primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues and less cash used for working
capital primarily from lower inventory additions and increases in other current liabilities.

Net cash used for investing activities totaled $2.4 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.9 billion in
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, due to gross property additions primarily related to
installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards; construction of generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities; and purchase of nuclear fuel. The majority of funds
needed for gross property additions for the last several years have been provided from operating
activities, capital contributions from Southern Company, and the issuance of debt and preference
stock.

Cash provided from financing activities totaled $881 million, $310 million, and $430 million for
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These totals are primarily related to additional issuances of
senior notes in all years. The statements of cash flows provide additional details. See
 Financing Activities  herein.

Significant balance sheet changes in 2009 include the $1.9 billion increase in total property,
plant, and equipment discussed above. Other significant balance sheet changes in 2009 include a
$776 million increase in long-term debt to provide funds for the Company s continuous construction
program. Significant balance sheet changes in 2008 include a $1.1 billion increase in long-term
debt primarily to replace short-term debt and provide funds for the Company s continuous
construction program and an increase in total property, plant, and equipment of $1.3 billion.
Other significant balance sheet changes in 2008 include a decrease of $1.0 billion in prepaid
pension costs, an increase of $908 million in other regulatory assets, and a decrease of $462
million in other regulatory liabilities primarily attributable to the decline in market value of
the Company s pension trust fund.

The Company s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 47.8%
in 2009, 46.5% in 2008, and 47.5% in 2007. The Company has received investment grade credit
ratings from the major rating agencies with respect to debt, preferred securities, preferred stock,
and preference stock. See  Credit Rating Risk  herein and SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA
for additional information regarding the Company s security ratings.

Sources of Capital 

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, security
issuances, term loans, short-term borrowings, and equity contributions from Southern Company.
However, the type and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend on market conditions,
regulatory approvals, and other factors. In addition, on February 16, 2010, the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) offered the Company a conditional commitment for federal loan guarantees that would
apply to future Company borrowings related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Any borrowings
guaranteed by the DOE would be full recourse to the Company and would be secured by a first
priority lien on the Company s ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Total guaranteed
borrowings would not exceed 70% of eligible project costs, or approximately $3.4 billion, and are
expected to be funded by the Federal Financing Bank. The Company has 90 days to accept the
conditional commitment, including obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals. The Company will
work with the DOE to finalize the loan guarantees. Final approval and issuance of loan guarantees
by the DOE are subject to receipt of the COL for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the NRC,
negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any
necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. There can be no assurance
that the DOE will issue loan guarantees for the Company. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  
 Construction   Nuclear  herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under  Nuclear Construction 
for more information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The issuance of long-term securities by the Company is subject to the approval of the Georgia PSC.
In addition, the issuance of short-term debt securities by the Company is subject to regulatory
approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company
files registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of securities authorized by the Georgia PSC and
the FERC are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the
capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information. The Southern
Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued use of
short-term debt as a funding source for under recovered fuel costs and to meet cash needs which can
fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, at December 31, 2009 the Company had credit
arrangements with banks totaling $1.7 billion. See Note 6 to the financial statements under  Bank
Credit Arrangements  for additional information. In addition, the Company has substantial cash
flow from operating activities and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program,
to meet liquidity needs.

At December 31, 2009, bank credit arrangements were as follows:

Of the credit arrangements that expire in 2010, $40 million allow for the execution of term loans
for an additional two-year period.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of the Company and the other
traditional operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are
loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with proceeds from issuances for the benefit
of any other operating company. The obligations of each company under these arrangements are
several; there is no cross affiliate credit support. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $324
million of outstanding commercial paper.

Financing Activities 

In February 2009, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2009A 5.95%
Senior Notes due February 1, 2039. In December 2009, the Company issued $500 million aggregate
principal amount of Series 2009B 4.25% Senior Notes due December 1, 2019. The net proceeds from
the sale of these senior notes were used by the Company to repay at maturity $150 million aggregate
principal amount of its Series U Floating Rate Senior Notes and $125 million aggregate principal
amount of its Series V 4.10% Senior Notes, to redeem $55 million aggregate principal amount of its
Series D 5.50% Senior Notes, to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term indebtedness, and for
general corporate purposes, including the Company s continuous construction program.

The Company also incurred $416.5 million of obligations related to the issuance of pollution
control revenue bonds, the proceeds of which were used to retire $327.3 million of pollution
control revenue bonds and to finance the construction of certain solid waste disposal facilities.

During 2009, the Company settled interest rate hedges of $300 million related to the issuance of
senior notes at a loss of $19 million. The effective portion of these losses has been deferred in
other comprehensive income and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the original
interest rate hedge.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual
obligations, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Credit Rating Risk 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales,
fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, emissions allowances, energy price risk
management, and construction of new generation facilities. At December 31, 2009, the maximum
potential collateral requirements under these contracts at a BBB- and/or Baa3 rating were
approximately $32 million. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential collateral requirements
under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 totaled approximately $1.2 billion.
Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that
one or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below
investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of
credit, or cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the Company s ability to
access capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

On September 2, 2009, Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) affirmed the credit ratings of the
Company s senior unsecured notes and commercial paper of A2/P-1, respectively, and revised the
rating outlook to negative. On September 4, 2009, Fitch Ratings, Inc. affirmed the Company s
senior unsecured notes and commercial paper ratings of A /F1, respectively, but revised the
Company s rating outlook to negative. On October 6, 2009, Standard and Poor s Rating Services, a
division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S P) affirmed the credit ratings of the Company s
senior unsecured notes and its short-term credit rating of A/A-1, respectively, and maintained its
stable rating outlook.

Market Price Risk 

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market rate volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures the Company nets the exposures,where possible, to take advantage of
natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management
practices. The Company s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes
and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress
tests, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company enters into forward starting
interest rate swaps and other derivatives that have been designated as hedges. These derivatives
have a notional amount of $300 million and are related to certain variable rate debt over the next
year. The weighted average interest rate on $1.2 billion of outstanding variable rate long-term
debt that has not been hedged at January 1, 2010 was 0.23%. If the Company sustained a 100 basis
point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would
affect annualized interest expense by approximately $12 million at January 1, 2010. See Notes 1
and 11 to the financial statements under  Financial Instruments  and  Interest Rate Derivatives, 
respectively, for additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market and, to a lesser extent, into financial hedge contracts for gas purchases.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

(a) 
       
     Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts
entered into during the period, if any. 

II-192 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The change in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the
year-ended December 31, 2009 was an increase of $38.2 million, substantially all of which is due to
natural gas positions. The change is attributable to both the volume of million British thermal
units (mmBtu) and the price of natural gas. At December 31, 2009, the Company had a net hedge
volume of 70.7 million mmBtu with a weighted average contract cost approximately $1.08 per mmBtu
above market prices, and 59.3 million mmBtu at December 31, 2008 with a weighted average contract
cost approximately $1.96 per mmBtu above market prices. Substantially all natural gas hedges gains
and losses are recovered through the Company s fuel cost recovery mechanism.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, all of the Company s energy-related derivative contracts were
designated as regulatory hedges related to the Company s fuel hedging program. Therefore, gains
and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are
included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the fuel cost recovery mechanism. Gains and
losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges
are recognized in the statements of income as incurred and were not material for any year
presented.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy
in which they fall at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

The Company uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using
prices which are actively quoted, and thus fall into Level 2. See Note 10 to the financial
statements for further discussion on fair value measurement.

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. The Company only enters into agreements and
material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody s and
S P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.

Therefore, the Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
 Financial Instruments  and Note 11 to the financial statements.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $2.5 billion for 2010, $2.4
billion for 2011, and $2.8 billion for 2012. Environmental expenditures included in these
estimated amounts are $259 million, $350 million, and $600 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012,
respectively. The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual
construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors
include: changes in business conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental
statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in
FERC rules and regulations; Georgia PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency
of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of
capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be
fully recovered. See Note 3 and Note 7 to the financial statements under  Construction   Nuclear 
and  Construction Program,  respectively, for additional information.

As a result of requirements by the NRC, the Company has established external trust funds for
nuclear decommissioning costs. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements
under  Nuclear Decommissioning. 

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the Georgia PSC and the FERC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt and the related interest, preferred and preference stock dividends, leases, derivative
obligations, and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, 7, and 11 to the
financial statements for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Contractual Obligations 

(a) 
       
     All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations
with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of January 1, 2010, as
reflected in the statements of capitalization. Fixed rates include, where applicable, the effects of interest rate derivatives employed to manage
interest rate risk. Excludes capital lease amounts (shown separately). 

(b) 
       
     Preferred and preference stock does not mature; therefore, amounts provided are for the next five years only. 

(c) 
       
     For additional information see Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements. 

(d) 
       
     The timing related to the realization of $18 million in unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest payments cannot be reasonably and reliably
estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. Of the total $201 million, $97 million is the estimated cash
payment. See Note 3 under  Income Tax Matters  and Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  to the financial statements for additional information. 

(e) 
       
     The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operations and maintenance expenditures. Total other operations and
maintenance expenses for the last three years were $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. 

(f) 
       
     The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent current estimates of total expenditures, excluding those amounts
related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection
with the construction program. 

(g) 
       
     As part of the Company s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal plants, the Company has entered into various long-term commitments for
the procurement of limestone to be used in flue gas desulfurization equipment. 

(h) 
       
     Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery. Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York
Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2009. 

(i) 
       
     Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices. 

(j) 
       
     Projections of nuclear decommissioning trust contributions are based on the 2007 Retail Rate Plan and are subject to change in the 2010 retail rate case. 

(k) 
       
     The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. The Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be
contributed to the pension trust fund is 2012. The projections of the amount vary significantly depending on key variables including future trust fund
performance and cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no amounts related to the pension trust fund are included in the table. See Note 2 to
the financial statements for additional information related to the pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain
benefit payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from the Company s corporate assets.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

The Company s 2009 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
include, among other things, statements concerning retail sales, retail rates, fuel cost recovery
and other rate actions, environmental regulations and expenditures, the Company s projections for
postretirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning trust contributions, financing activities,
access to sources of capital, the impacts of the adoption of new accounting rules, impacts of the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, impact of healthcare legislation, if any, estimated

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

General 

Georgia Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC
Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company,
Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
companies   Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power), the Company, Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power),
and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power)   provide electric service in four Southeastern
states. The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail
customers within its traditional service area located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale
customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation
assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system
service company, provides at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary
companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern
Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public, and provides
fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company
subsidiary for Southern Company s investments in leveraged leases and various other energy-related
businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company s nuclear power
plants, including the Company s Plants Hatch and Vogtle.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but does
not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary beneficiary.
Certain prior years  data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions 

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
operations. Costs for these services amounted to $506 million in 2009, $490 million in 2008, and
$449 million in 2007. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be rendered at
cost by system service companies.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which the following nuclear-related
services are rendered to the Company at cost: general executive and advisory services, general
operations, management and technical services, administrative services including procurement,
accounting, employee relations, systems and procedures services, strategic planning and budgeting
services, and other services with respect to business and operations. Costs for these services
amounted to $398 million in 2009, $410 million in 2008, and $380 million in 2007.

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company had an agreement with Southern Power under which the Company operated and maintained
Southern Power s Plants Dahlberg, Franklin, and Wansley at cost. In August 2007, that agreement
was terminated and replaced with a service agreement under which the Company provides to Southern
Power specifically requested services. Billings under these agreements with Southern Power
amounted to $0.5 million in 2009, $1.9 million in 2008, and $6.8 million in 2007.

Southern Company s 30% ownership interest in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), which produced
synthetic fuel, was terminated in July 2006. The Company had an agreement with an indirect
subsidiary of Southern Company that provided services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company
provided certain accounting functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation
invoices, and the Company was reimbursed for its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement
totaled approximately $85 million in 2007. In addition, the Company purchased synthetic fuel from
AFP for use at Plant Branch. Synthetic fuel purchases totaled $278 million in 2007. The related
party transactions and synthetic fuel purchases were terminated as of December 31, 2007.

The Company has entered into several power purchase agreements (PPA) with Southern Power for
capacity and energy. Expenses associated with these PPAs were $411 million, $480 million, and $440
million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Additionally, the Company had $24 million and $25
million of prepaid capacity expenses included in deferred charges and other assets in the balance
sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 7 under  Purchased Power Commitments 
for additional information.

The Company has an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf Power jointly owns a portion of Plant
Scherer. Under this agreement, the Company operates Plant Scherer and Gulf Power reimburses the
Company for its proportionate share of the related non-fuel expenses, which were $3.9 million in
2009, $8.1 million in 2008, and $5.1 million in 2007. See Note 4 for additional information.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such services from other Southern Company
subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. The Company neither provided nor
received any significant services to or from affiliates in 2009, 2008, or 2007.

Also see Note 4 for information regarding the Company s ownership in and a PPA with Southern
Electric Generating Company (SEGCO) and Note 5 for information on certain deferred tax liabilities
due to affiliates.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power may jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under  Fuel Commitments  for additional
information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 

The Company is subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board in accounting
for the effects of governmental regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues
associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking
process.

II-204 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the Company s balance sheets at December 31 relate
to the following:

Note: The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are as follows: 

(a) 
       
     Asset retirement and deferred income tax assets are recovered, and deferred tax liabilities are amortized over the related
property lives, which may range up to 60 years. Asset retirement and other cost of removal liabilities will be settled and
trued up following completion of the related activities. Other cost of removal obligations include $216 million that may be
amortized during 2010. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate Plans  for additional information. 

(b) 
       
     Recovered over either the remaining life of the original issue or, if refinanced, over the life of the new issue which may
range up to 50 years. 

(c) 
       
     Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year. 

(d) 
       
     Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the Georgia PSC over periods not exceeding three years. 

(e) 
       
     Recovered and amortized over the average remaining service period which may range up to 15 years. See Note 2 for additional
information. 

(f) 
       
     Fuel-hedging assets and liabilities are recorded over the life of the underlying hedged purchase contracts, which generally
do not exceed 42 months. Upon final settlement, costs are recovered through the Company s fuel cost recovery mechanism. 

(g) 
       
     This balance represents deferred revenue associated with the environmental compliance cost recovery (ECCR) tariff established
in the 2007 Retail Rate Plan (as defined below). The recovery of the forecasted environmental compliance costs was levelized
to collect equal annual amounts between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010 under the tariff. 

(h) 
       
     Not earning a return as offset in rate base by a corresponding asset or liability. 

(i) 
       
     See Note 6 under  Capital Leases.  Recovered over the remaining lives of the buildings through 2026. 

(j) 
       
     See  Property, Plant, and Equipment.  Recovered over the respective operating cycles, which range from 18 months to 10 years. 

In the event that a portion of the Company s operations is no longer subject to applicable
accounting rules for rate regulation, the Company would be required to write off or reclassify to
accumulated other comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to
determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if
impaired, to their fair value. All regulatory assets and liabilities are reflected in rates.

Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Revenues 

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs and the energy component of purchased power costs, and
certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between the actual recoverable costs
and amounts billed in current regulated rates.

Retail fuel cost recovery rates require periodic filings with the Georgia PSC. See Note 3 under
 Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  for information on the Company s current fuel
case proceeding.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10% or
more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of
revenues.

Fuel Costs 

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emissions
allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear
fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
See Note 3 under  Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs  for additional information.

Income and Other Taxes 

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with accounting standards related to the uncertainty in income taxes, the Company
recognizes tax positions that are  more likely than not  of being sustained upon examination by the
appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  for additional
information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost, less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The Company s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed with the exception of certain generating plant maintenance costs.
As mandated by the Georgia PSC, the Company defers and amortizes nuclear refueling outage costs
over the unit s operating cycle. The refueling cycles are 18 and 24 months for Plants Vogtle and
Hatch, respectively. Also, in accordance with the Georgia PSC, the Company defers the costs of
certain significant inspection costs for the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizes
such costs over 10 years, which approximates the expected maintenance cycle.

II-206 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.0% in 2009, 2.9% in 2008, and 2.6% in 2007.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates that are approved by
the Georgia PSC. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company s depreciation rates were revised by the
Georgia PSC.

When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to
accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated
depreciation is removed from the balance sheet accounts and a gain or loss is recognized. Minor
items of property included in the original cost of the plant are retired when the related property
unit is retired.

Under the Company s retail rate plan for the three years ended December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate
Plan), the Company was ordered to recognize Georgia PSC certified capacity costs in rates evenly
over the three years covered by the 2004 Retail Rate Plan. The Company recorded credits to
amortization of $19 million in 2007. The retail rate plan for the three years ending December 31,
2010 (2007 Retail Rate Plan) did not include a similar order.

On August 27, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved an accounting order allowing the Company to amortize
up to $324 million of its regulatory liability related to other cost of removal obligations. See
Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate Plans  for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal 

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset s useful life.
The Company has received accounting guidance from the Georgia PSC allowing the continued accrual of
other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are
reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory
Matters   Rate Plans  for additional information related to the Company s cost of removal
regulatory liability.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company s nuclear
facilities, which include the Company s ownership interests in Plants Hatch and Vogtle. The fair
value of assets legally restricted for settling retirement obligations related to nuclear
facilities as of December 31, 2009 was $580 million. In addition, the Company has retirement
obligations related to various landfill sites, ash ponds, underground storage tanks, and asbestos
removal. The Company also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission
and distribution facilities, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
associated with the Company s rail lines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets
have not been recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle these
obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize
in the statements of income the allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment.
Any difference between costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards related to asset
retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a
regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the Georgia PSC. See  Nuclear
Decommissioning  herein for further information on amounts included in rates.

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Nuclear Decommissioning 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. The
Company has external trust funds (the Funds) to comply with the NRC s regulations. Use of the
Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the Funds are managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC,
and the Georgia PSC, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Funds are required to be
held by one or more trustees with an individual net worth of at least $100 million. The FERC
requires the Funds  managers to exercise the standard of care in investing that a  prudent
investor  would use in the same circumstances. The FERC regulations also require, except for
investments tied to market indices or other mutual funds, that the Funds  managers may not invest
in any securities of the utility for which it manages funds or its affiliates. In addition, the
NRC prohibits investments in securities of power reactor licensees. While the Company is allowed
to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds  managers, the Company is not allowed to
engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to mandate individual investment decisions.
Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated third party
managers with oversight by the Company s management. The Funds  managers are authorized, within
broad limits, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the
return on the Funds  investments. The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a
diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as trading securities.

The Company records the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note
10. Gains and losses, whether realized, unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary, are
recorded in the regulatory liability for asset retirement obligations in the balance sheets and are
not included in net income or other comprehensive income. Fair value adjustments, realized gains,
and other-than-temporary impairment losses are determined on a specific identification basis.

At December 31, 2009, investment securities in the Funds totaled $580.0 million consisting of
equity securities of $428.6 million, debt securities of $138.0 million, and $13.4 million of other
securities. At December 31, 2008, investment securities in the Funds totaled $459.1 million,
consisting of equity securities of $261.4 million, debt securities of $187.3 million, and $10.4
million of other securities. These amounts exclude receivables related to investment income and
pending investment sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases.

Sales of the securities held in the Funds resulted in cash proceeds of $984.3 million, $412.2
million, and $441.4 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, all of which were re-invested.
For 2009, fair value increases, including reinvested interest and dividends and excluding expenses,
were $118.7 million, of which $117.8 million relates to securities held in the Funds at December
31, 2009. For 2008, fair value reductions, including reinvested interest and dividends and
excluding expenses, were $(143.9) million. Realized gains and other-than-temporary impairment
losses were $43.7 million and $(39.1) million, respectively, in 2007. While the investment
securities held in the Funds are reported as trading securities, the Funds continue to be managed
with a long-term focus. Accordingly, all purchases and sales within the Funds are presented
separately in the statement of cash flows as investing cash flows, consistent with the nature of
and purpose for which the securities were acquired.

The NRC s minimum external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to
decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor.
The Company has filed plans with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and
earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the
NRC.

II-208 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year. The
estimated costs of decommissioning are based on the most current study performed in 2009. The site
study costs and accumulated provisions for decommissioning as of December 31, 2009 based on the
Company s ownership interests were as follows:

The decommissioning periods and site study costs for Plant Vogtle reflect the extended operating
license approved by the NRC on June 3, 2009. The decommissioning cost estimates are based on
prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may
vary from these estimates because of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC
requirements, or changes in the assumptions used in making these estimates.

For ratemaking purposes, the Company s decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate
to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities. The annual decommissioning costs for
ratemaking were $7 million for Plant Vogtle for 2007. Under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, effective
for the years 2008 through 2010, the annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is $3 million for
Plant Vogtle. Based on estimates approved in the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, the Company projected the
external trust funds for Plant Hatch would be adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations with
no further contributions. The NRC estimates are $531 million and $366 million for Plants Hatch and
Vogtle, respectively. Significant assumptions used to determine the costs for ratemaking include
an estimated inflation rate of 2.9% and an estimated trust earnings rate of 4.9%. The Company
expects the Georgia PSC to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in
rates for nuclear decommissioning costs.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized 

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the revenue
requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher depreciation.
The equity component of AFUDC is not included in calculating taxable income. For the years 2009,
2008, and 2007, the average AFUDC rates were 8.0%, 8.2%, and 8.4%, respectively, and AFUDC
capitalized was $136.6 million, $135.1 million, and $96.8 million, respectively. AFUDC, net of
taxes, was 14.9%, 13.3%, and 10.3% of net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock
for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles 

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of,
their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Storm Damage Reserve 

The Company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of damages from major storms
to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its generation
facilities and other property as mandated by the Georgia PSC. In 2007, the Company accrued $6.6
million annually that was recoverable through base rates. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company
is accruing $21.4 million annually under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan. The Company expects the
Georgia PSC to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for
storm damage costs.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies 

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory 

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emissions allowances.
Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the Company
through fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. Emissions allowances granted by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (included in  Other  or shown
separately as  Risk Management Activities ) and are measured at fair value. See Note 10 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Georgia PSC-approved
fuel hedging program. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in
net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are
recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. See Note 11 for additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
has no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2009.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties 
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive Income 

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity

Variable Interest Entities 

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. However, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts.
Therefore, the investments in these trusts are reflected as Other Investments, and the related
loans from the trusts are reflected as Long-term Debt in the balance sheets. See Note 6 under
 Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts  for additional information.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS 

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the defined benefit plan are expected for the
year ending December 31, 2010. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension plans for
a selected group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these
non-qualified pension plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain
medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit
plans. The Company funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC. For the year ending December
31, 2010, postretirement trust contributions are expected to total approximately $31 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2009 and 2008 was December 31 while the
measurement date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to accounting standards related to
defined postretirement benefit plans, the Company was required to change the measurement date for
its defined postretirement benefit plans from September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions
effective January 1, 2008 resulting in an increase in long-term liabilities of $10 million and an
increase in prepaid pension costs of approximately $10 million.

Pension Plans 

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $2.4 billion in 2009 and $2.1
billion in 2008. Changes during the plan year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15-month period
ended December 31, 2008 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were
as follows:

At December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $2.4 billion and $135 million, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to the
qualified pension plan.

Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). In
2009, in determining the optimal asset allocation for the pension fund, the Company performed an
extensive study based on projections of both assets and liabilities over a 10-year forward horizon.
The primary goal of the study was to maximize plan funded status. The Company s investment policy
covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real estate, and
private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily to gain efficient exposure to the
various asset classes and as hedging tools. The Company minimizes the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

The actual composition of the Company s pension plan assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, along
with the targeted mix of assets, is presented below:

The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Company s defined benefit plan is to be
broadly diversified across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after
consideration of various factors that affect the assets and liabilities of the pension plan
including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns, volatility, correlations of asset
classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and
liabilities. Because a significant portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in
nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment expectations for return and
risk. To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the
Company employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment
managers and service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent
investment practices.

Detailed below is a description of the investment strategies for each major asset category
disclosed above:

Domestic equity.   This portion of the portfolio comprises a mix of large and small
capitalization stocks with generally an equal distribution of value and growth attributes
managed both actively and through passive index approaches. 

International equity.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed with a blend of
growth stocks and value stocks with both developed and emerging market exposure. 

Fixed income.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed through an allocation to
long-dated, investment grade corporate and government bonds. 

Special situations.   Though currently unfunded, this portion of the portfolio was established
both to execute opportunistic investment strategies with the objectives of diversifying and
enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as to invest in promising
new strategies of a longer-term nature. 

Real estate investments.   Assets in this portion of the portfolio are invested in traditional
private market, equity-oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate securities. 

Private equity.   This portion of the portfolio generally consists of investments in private
partnerships that invest in private or public securities typically through privately
negotiated and/or structured transactions. Leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed
debt are examples of investment strategies within this category.

Changes in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 items in the pension plan assets valued
using significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as
follows:

The fair values presented above are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards
regarding fair value. For purposes of determining the fair value of the pension plan assets and
the appropriate level designation, management relies on information provided by the plan s trustee.
This information is reviewed and evaluated by management with changes made to the trustee
information as appropriate.

Securities for which the activity is observable on an active market or traded exchange are
categorized as Level 1. Fixed income securities classified as Level 2 are valued utilizing matrix
pricing, a common model utilizing observable inputs. Domestic and international equity securities
classified as Level 2 consist of pooled funds where the value is not quoted on an exchange but
where the value is determined using observable inputs from the market. Securities that are valued
using unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3 and include investments in real estate and
investments in limited partnerships. The Company invests (through the pension plan trustee)
directly in the limited partnerships which then invest in various types of funds or various private
entities within a fund. The fair value of the limited partnerships  investments is based on
audited annual capital accounts statements which are generally prepared on a fair value basis. The
Company also relies on the fact that, in most instances, the underlying assets held by the limited
partnerships are reported at fair value. External investment managers typically send valuations to
both the custodian and to the Company within 90 days of quarter end. The custodian reports the
most recent value available and adjusts the value for cash flows since the statement date for each
respective fund.

Amounts recognized in the balance sheets related to the Company s pension plans consist of the
following:

Presented below are the amounts included in regulatory assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 related
to the defined benefit pension plans that had not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost

The changes in the balances of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to the
defined benefit pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15 months ended December
31, 2008 are presented in the following table:

Components of net periodic pension cost (income) were as follows:

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs
netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value
of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to
amortize changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the
changes immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate
the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2009, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) provides
a 28% prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company s expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 by approximately $14
million, $14 million, and $14 million, respectively, and is expected to have a similar impact on
future expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service and
are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the APBO for the postretirement plans.
Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy receipts expected as a result of the
Medicare Act as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions 

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2006 for the 2007 plan year using a discount rate of 6.00% and an annual
salary increase of 3.50%.

The Company estimates the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit
plan assets using a financial model to project the expected return on each current investment
portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each of seven different asset
classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust s
target asset allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on
four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset class (based in part on historical returns), each
trust s asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact of a periodic
rebalancing of each trust s portfolio.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 8.50% for 2010, decreasing gradually to 5.25% through the year 2016 and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%
would affect the APBO and the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2009 as follows:

The Company provides an 85% matching contribution up to 6% of an employee s base salary. Total
matching contributions made to the plan for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $25 million, $25 million, and
$24 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

General Litigation Matters 

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment such as regulation of air emissions and
water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including
property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental
requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury and other claims for damages caused
by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief
and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have become more
frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot
be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.

Environmental Matters 

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, alleging
that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act
and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. The action was filed
concurrently with the issuance of a notice of violation of the NSR provisions to the Company.
After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action, the EPA filed a separate action in
January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.
In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating
facilities operated by Alabama Power and the Company. The civil actions request penalties and
injunctive relief, including an order requiring installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The original action, now solely against the Company, has been
administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the

II-221 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation  

The Company must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties.

In 2007, the Company s rates included an annual accrual of $5.4 million for environmental
remediation. Beginning in January 2008, the Company is recovering environmental remediation costs
through a new base rate tariff (see  Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate Plans  herein) that includes
an annual accrual of $1.2 million for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation
expenditures are charged against the reserve as they are incurred. The annual accrual amount is
expected to be reviewed and adjusted in future regulatory proceedings. As of December 31, 2009,
the balance of the environmental remediation liability was $12.5 million.

The Company has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at sites
governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), including a large site in
Brunswick, Georgia on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). The parties have completed the
removal of wastes from the Brunswick site as ordered by the EPA. Additional claims for recovery of
natural resource damages at this site or for the assessment and potential cleanup of other sites on
the Georgia Hazardous Sites Inventory and the CERCLA NPL are anticipated. The final outcome of
these matters cannot now be determined. Based on the currently known conditions at these sites and
the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites, management does not believe that
additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material to the financial statements.

By letter dated September 30, 2008, the EPA advised the Company that it has been designated as a
PRP at the Ward Transformer Superfund site located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Numerous other
entities have also received notices from the EPA. The Company, along with other named PRPs, is
negotiating with the EPA to address cleanup of the site and reimbursement for past expenditures
related to work performed at the site. In addition, on April 30, 2009, two PRPs filed separate
actions in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against numerous
other PRPs, including the Company, seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred
by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site. The ultimate outcome of
these matters will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of PRPs and
cannot be determined at this time; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s financial statements.

FERC Matters 

Market-Based Rate Authority  

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company s generation market
power within its retail service
territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets was not an issue in the
proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern Company s retail service
territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May 2006 could have been
subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

II-222 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

On December 23, 2009, Southern Company and the FERC trial staff reached an agreement in
principle that would resolve the proceeding in its entirety. The agreement does not reflect any
finding or suggestion that the Company possesses or has exercised any market power. The agreement
likewise does not require the Company to make any refunds related to sales during the 15-month
refund period. Under the agreement, the Company will donate $0.7 million to nonprofit
organizations in the State of Georgia for the purpose of offsetting the electricity bills of
low-income retail customers. The agreement is subject to review and approval by the FERC.

Intercompany Interchange Contract  

The Company s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies (including the Company), Southern
Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated,
(2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC s standards of conduct applicable to
utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company s code of
conduct defining Southern Power as a  system company  rather than a  marketing affiliate  is just
and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern
Power s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company s code of
conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement s terms.
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. In December 2008, the FERC division of audits issued
for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and related
matters. No comments were submitted challenging the audit report s findings of Southern Company s
compliance. The proceeding remains open pending a decision from the FERC regarding the audit
report.

Income Tax Matters 

The Company s 2005 through 2008 income tax filings for the State of Georgia included state income
tax credits for increased activity through Georgia ports. The Company has also filed similar
claims for the years 2002 through 2004. The Georgia Department of Revenue has not responded to
these claims. In July 2007, the Company filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County
to recover the credits claimed for the years 2002 through 2004. An unrecognized tax benefit has
been recorded related to these credits. See Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  for
additional information. If the Company prevails, these claims could have a significant, and
possibly material, positive effect on the Company s net income. If the Company is not successful,
payment of the related state tax could have a significant, and possibly material, negative effect
on the Company s cash flow. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs 

The Company has contracts with the United States, acting through the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), which provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin
disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contracts, and the Company is pursuing
legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.

In July 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded the Company approximately $30 million, based
on its ownership interests, representing substantially all of the direct costs of the expansion of
spent nuclear fuel storage facilities at Plants Hatch and Vogtle from 1998 through 2004. In
November 2007, the government s motion for reconsideration was denied. In January 2008, the
government filed an appeal and, in February 2008, filed a motion to stay the appeal. In April
2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted the government s motion to stay the
appeal pending the court s decisions in three other similar cases already on appeal. Those cases
were decided in August 2008. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has left the stay
of appeals in place pending the decision in an appeal of another case involving spent nuclear fuel
contracts.

In April 2008, a second claim against the government was filed for damages incurred after December
31, 2004 (the court-mandated cut-off in the original claim), due to the government s alleged
continuing breach of contract. In October 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
denied a similar request by the government to stay this proceeding. The complaint does not contain

II-223

any specific dollar amount for recovery of damages. Damages will continue to accumulate until
the issue is resolved or the storage is provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial
statements as of December 31, 2009 for either claim. The final outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time, but no material impact on net income is expected as any damage amounts
collected from the government are expected to be returned to customers.

Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core
discharge capability for both units into 2014. Construction of an on-site dry storage facility at
Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge
capability. At Plant Hatch, an on-site dry storage facility is operational and can be expanded to
accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of the plant.

Retail Regulatory Matters 

Rate Plans  

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the Company s retail rate plan for the years 2005
through 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan). Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Company s
earnings were evaluated against a retail return on equity (ROE) range of 10.25% to 12.25%.
Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25% were applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third
retained by the Company. Retail rates and customer fees increased by approximately $203 million
effective January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased power, operating and maintenance
expenses, environmental compliance, and continued investment in new generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. In 2007, the Company refunded
2005 earnings above 12.25% retail ROE. There were no refunds related to earnings for 2007.

In December 2007, the Georgia PSC approved the 2007 Retail Rate Plan for the years 2008 through
2010. Under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, the Company s earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE
range of 10.25% to 12.25%. Retail base rates increased by approximately $100 million effective
January 1, 2008 to provide for cost recovery of transmission, distribution, generation, and other
investments, as well as increased operating costs. In addition, the ECCR tariff was implemented to
allow for the recovery of costs related to environmental projects mandated by state and federal
regulations. The ECCR tariff increased rates by approximately $222 million effective January 1,
2008.

In connection with the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, the Company agreed that it would not file for a
general base rate increase during this period unless its projected retail ROE falls below 10.25%.
The economic recession has significantly reduced the Company s revenues upon which retail rates
were set under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan. In June 2009, despite stringent efforts to reduce
expenses, the Company s projected retail ROE for both 2009 and 2010 was below 10.25%. However, in
lieu of filing to increase customer rates as allowed under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, on June 29,
2009, the Company filed a request with the Georgia PSC for an accounting order that would allow the
Company to amortize up to $324 million of its regulatory liability related to other cost of removal
obligations.

On August 27, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved the accounting order. Under the terms of the
accounting order, the Company was entitled to amortize up to one-third of the regulatory liability
($108 million) in 2009, limited to the amount needed to earn no more than a 9.75% retail ROE. For
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company amortized $41 million of the regulatory liability.
In addition, the Company may amortize up to two-thirds of the regulatory liability ($216 million)
in 2010, limited to the amount needed to earn no more than a 10.15% retail ROE.

The Company is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, in response to which the
Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan should be continued,
modified, or discontinued.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In February
2007, the Georgia PSC approved an increase in the Company s total annual billings of approximately
$383 million effective March 1, 2007. On May 20, 2008, the Georgia PSC approved an additional
increase of approximately $222 million effective June 1, 2008. The order in that case required the
Company to file a new fuel cost recovery rate by March 1, 2009, which was subsequently approved by
the Georgia PSC to be delayed until December 15, 2009.

On December 15,
2009, the Company filed for a fuel cost recovery increase with the
Georgia PSC. On February 22, 2010, the Company, the Georgia PSC
Public Interest Advocacy Staff, and three customer groups entered into
a stipulation to resolve the case, subject to approval by the Georgia
PSC (the Stipulation). Under the terms of the Stipulation, the
Company s annual fuel cost recovery billings will increase by
approximately $425 million. In addition, the Company will implement
an interim fuel rider, which would allow the Company to adjust its
fuel cost recovery rates prior to the next fuel case if the under
recovered fuel balance exceeds budget by more than $75 million.
The Company is required to file its next fuel case by March 1, 2011.
The Georgia PSC is scheduled to vote on the Stipulation on March 11,
2010 with the new fuel rates to become effective April 1, 2010. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

II-224 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had a total under recovered fuel cost balance of
approximately $764.4 million.
As of  December 31, 2009, the Company s  under recovered fuel
balance totaled approximately $665
million, which if the Stipulation is approved, the Company will
recover over  32 months  beginning  April 1, 2010. Therefore,
approximately $373 million of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues for
the Company is included in deferred charges and other assets  at December
31, 2009.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded in the financial statements are adjusted for differences in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, a change in
the billing factor has no significant effect on the Company s revenues or net income, but does
impact annual cash flow.

Construction 

Nuclear  

On August 26, 2009, the NRC issued an Early Site Permit and Limited Work Authorization to Southern
Nuclear, on behalf of the Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC), the Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), and the City of Dalton, Georgia, an incorporated municipality in
the State of Georgia acting by and through its Board of Water, Light, and Sinking Fund
Commissioners (collectively, Owners), related to two additional nuclear units on the site of Plant
Vogtle (Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4). See Note 4 for additional information on these co-owners. In
March 2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a combined construction and
operating license (COL) for the new units. If licensed by the NRC, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are
scheduled to be placed in service in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

In April 2008, the Company, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium
consisting of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (Westinghouse) and Stone   Webster, Inc.
(collectively, Consortium) entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement to
design, engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units with electric generating
capacity of approximately 1,100 megawatts each and related facilities, structures, and improvements
at Plant Vogtle (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement).

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is an arrangement whereby the Consortium supplies and constructs the
entire facility with the exception of certain items provided by the Owners. Under the terms of the
Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Owners agreed to pay a purchase price that will be subject to certain
price escalations and adjustments, including certain index-based adjustments, as well as
adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses for early completion and unit performance.
Each Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its
ownership interest, of all amounts owed to the Consortium under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. The
Company s proportionate share is 45.7%.

On
February 23, 2010, the Company, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and the
Consortium entered into an amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. The amendment, which is
subject to the approval of the Georgia PSC, replaces certain of the index-based adjustments to the
purchase price with fixed escalation amounts.

The Owners and the Consortium have agreed to certain liquidated damages upon the Consortium s
failure to comply with the schedule and performance guarantees. The Consortium s liability to the
Owners for schedule and performance liquidated damages and warranty claims is subject to a cap.

Certain payment obligations of Westinghouse and Stone   Webster, Inc. under the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement are guaranteed by Toshiba Corporation and The Shaw Group, Inc., respectively. In the
event of certain credit rating downgrades of any Owner, such Owner will be required to provide a
letter of credit or other credit enhancement.

The Owners may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided
that the Owners will be required to pay certain termination costs and, at certain stages of the
work, cancellation fees to the Consortium. The Consortium may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement under certain circumstances, including delays in receipt of the COL or delivery of full
notice to proceed, certain Owner suspension or delays of work, action by a governmental authority
to permanently stop work, certain breaches of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement by the Owners, Owner
insolvency, and certain other events.

On March 17, 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at
an in-service cost of $6.4 billion. In addition, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the inclusion of
the related construction work in progress accounts in rate base.

II-225

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

On April 21, 2009, the Governor of the State of Georgia signed into law the Georgia Nuclear
Energy Financing Act that will allow the Company to recover financing costs for nuclear
construction projects by including the related construction work in progress accounts in rate base
during the construction period. The cost recovery provisions will become effective on January 1,
2011. With respect to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, this legislation allows the Company to recover
projected financing costs of approximately $1.7 billion during the construction period beginning in
2011, which reduces the projected in-service cost to approximately $4.4 billion.

On June 15, 2009, an environmental group filed a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia seeking review of the Georgia PSC s certification order and challenging the
constitutionality of the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act. The Company believes there is no
meritorious basis for this petition and intends to vigorously defend against the requested actions.

On August 27, 2009, the NRC issued letters to Westinghouse revising the review schedules needed to
certify the AP1000 standard design for new reactors and expressing concerns related to the
availability of adequate information and the shield building design. The shield building protects
the containment and provides structural support to the containment cooling water supply. The
Company is continuing to work with Westinghouse and the NRC to resolve these concerns. Any
possible delays in the AP1000 design certification schedule, including those addressed by the NRC
in their letters, are not currently expected to affect the projected commercial operation dates for
Plant Vogtle Units 3  and 4. 

There are pending technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Similar additional challenges at the state and federal level are expected as
construction proceeds.

On August 31, 2009, the Company filed with the Georgia PSC its first semi-annual construction
monitoring report for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for the period ended June 30, 2009 which did not
include any proposed change to the estimated construction cost as certified by the Georgia PSC in
March 2009. On February 25, 2010, the Georgia PSC approved the expenditures made by the Company
pursuant to the certification through June 30, 2009. The Georgia PSC also ordered that in its
future semi-annual construction monitoring reports, the Company will report against a total
certified cost of approximately $6.1 billion, which is the effective certified amount after giving
effect to the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act as described above. The Company will continue
to file construction monitoring reports by February 28 and August 31 of each year during the
construction period.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Other Construction  

On August 10, 2009, the Company filed its quarterly construction monitoring report for Plant
McDonough Units 4, 5, and 6 for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. On September 30, 2009, the
Company amended the report. As amended, the report includes a request for an increase in the
certified costs to construct Plant McDonough. The Georgia PSC held a hearing in December 2009 and
is scheduled to render its decision on March 16, 2010. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
be determined at this time.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS 

The Company and Alabama Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns
electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as well as associated
transmission facilities. The capacity of these units is sold equally to the Company and Alabama
Power under a contract which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to provide for the
operating expenses, taxes, debt service, and return on investment, whether or not SEGCO has any
capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically for two-year
periods, subject to either party s right to cancel upon two year s notice. The Company accounts
for SEGCO using the equity method.

The Company s share of expenses included in purchased power from affiliates in the statements of
income is as follows:

II-226 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company owns undivided interests in Plants Vogtle, Hatch, Scherer, and Wansley in varying
amounts jointly with OPC, MEAG Power, Dalton, Florida Power   Light Company, Jacksonville Electric
Authority, and Gulf Power. Under these agreements, the Company has contracted to operate and
maintain the plants as agent for the co-owners and is jointly and severally liable for third party
claims related to these plants. In addition, the Company jointly owns the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric plant with OPC who is the operator of the plant. The Company and Florida
Power Corporation (Progress Energy Florida) jointly own a combustion turbine unit (Intercession
City) operated by Progress Energy Florida.

At December 31, 2009, the Company s percentage ownership and investment (exclusive of nuclear
fuel) in jointly owned facilities in commercial operation were as follows:

At December 31, 2009, the portion of total construction work in progress related to Plants Wansley,
Scherer, and Vogtle Units 3 and 4 was $5 million, $247 million, and $611 million, respectively.
Construction at Plants Wansley and Scherer relates primarily to environmental projects. See Note 3
under  Construction   Nuclear  for information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

The Company s proportionate share of its plant operating expenses is included in the corresponding
operating expenses in the statements of income and the Company is responsible for providing its own
financing.

5. INCOME TAXES 

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined state income tax
returns for the States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax
allocation agreement, each subsidiary s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the tax liability.

Current and Deferred Income Taxes 

The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project from Southern Power to the Company in 2005
resulted in a deferred gain to Southern Power for federal income tax purposes. The Company is
reimbursing Southern Power for the remaining balance of the related deferred taxes of $3.9 million
as it is reflected in Southern Power s future taxable income. Of this amount, $3.5 million is
included in Other Deferred Credits and $0.4 million is included in Affiliated Accounts Payable in
the balance sheets at December 31, 2009.

The transfer of the Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin projects to Southern Power from the Company in
2001 and 2002 also resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax purposes. Southern Power is
reimbursing the Company for the remaining balance of the related deferred taxes of $6.7 million as
it is reflected in the Company s future taxable income. Of this amount, $5.7 million is included
in Other Deferred Debits and $1.0 million is included in Affiliated Accounts Receivable in the
balance sheets at December 31, 2009.

II-228 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, tax-related regulatory assets were $609 million and tax-related
regulatory liabilities were $134 million. The assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed
through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The
liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than current
enacted tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits. In accordance with regulatory
requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the life of the related property
with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation in the statements of
income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $13.7 million in 2009 and $13.0 million
annually in 2008 and 2007. At December 31, 2009, all investment tax credits available to reduce
federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

Effective Tax Rate 

A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as
follows:

The decrease in the Company s 2009 effective tax rate is primarily the result of the Company s
donation of 5,111 acres of land to the State of Georgia combined with an increase in non-taxable
AFUDC equity and a decrease in tax deductions related to unrecognized tax benefits. See
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits  and Note 3 under  Income Tax Matters  for additional information on
these unrecognized tax benefits and related litigation.

The increase in the Company s 2008 effective tax rate is primarily the result of a decrease in
donations for 2008 as a result of the Tallulah Gorge land donation in 2007 combined with an
increase in non-taxable AFUDC equity. In 2007, the Company donated 2,200 acres of land in the
Tallulah Gorge State Park to the State of Georgia.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production
activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate
applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a
9% rate thereafter. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction.
However, Southern Company reached an agreement with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed
a closing agreement in December 2008. Therefore, in 2008, the Company reversed the unrecognized
tax benefit related to the calculation methodology and adjusted the deduction for all previous
years to conform to the agreement which resulted in a decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared
to the 2007 deduction. Certain aspects of the production activities deduction remain unresolved.
The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the application of
the new methodology had no material effect on the Company s financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

For 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $44.3 million, resulting in a
balance of $181.4 million as of December 31, 2009.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

II-229 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The tax positions from current periods increase for 2009 relate primarily to the Georgia state
tax credits litigation, the production activities deduction tax position, and other miscellaneous
uncertain tax positions. The tax positions increase from prior periods for 2009 relates primarily to the
production activities deduction tax position. See Note 3 under  Income Tax Matters  for additional
information.

Impact on the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized, is as follows:

The tax positions impacting the effective tax rate  primarily relate to
Georgia state tax credit litigation at the Company. See Note 3 under  Income Tax Matters  for
additional information.

Accrued interest for unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

The Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The Company did not accrue any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2006.

Substantially all of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits impacting the effective tax rate are
associated with the state income tax credits discussed in Note 3 under  Income Tax Matters. 
Settlement of this litigation could occur within the next 12 months, which would reduce the balance
of the uncertain tax position by these amounts.

6. FINANCING 

Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts 

The Company has formed certain wholly-owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $206 million,
which constitute substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are reflected in the balance
sheets as Long-term Debt. The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to
the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts  payment obligations with respect to these
securities. At December 31, 2009, preferred securities of $200 million were outstanding. See
Note 1 under  Variable Interest Entities  for additional information on the accounting treatment
for these trusts and the related securities.

Securities Due Within One Year 

A summary of the scheduled maturities and redemptions of securities due within one year at
December 31 is as follows:

Maturities through 2014 applicable to total long-term debt are as follows: $254 million in 2010;
$415 million in 2011; $205 million in 2012; $530 million in 2013; and $5 million in 2014.

II-230 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet
principal and interest requirements of such bonds. The Company has incurred obligations in
connection with the sale by public authorities of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds. The
amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
$2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Proceeds from certain issuances are restricted until
qualifying expenditures are incurred.

Senior Notes 

The Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in 2009. The
proceeds of the issuance were used to repay a portion of the Company s short-term indebtedness,
fund note redemptions totaling $333 million, redeem pollution control revenue bonds totaling $327.3
million, and fund the Company s continuous construction program. At December 31, 2009 and 2008,
the Company had $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion of senior notes outstanding, respectively. These
senior notes are effectively subordinated to all secured debt of the Company, which aggregated $63
million and $68 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Bank Term Loans 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had a $300 million bank loan outstanding, which matures
in March 2011.

Capital Leases 

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded in the balance sheets as utility plant in
service, and the related obligations are classified as long-term debt. At December 31, 2009 and
2008, the Company had a capitalized lease obligation for its corporate headquarters building of $62
million and $66 million, respectively, with an interest rate of 8.0%. For ratemaking purposes, the
Georgia PSC has treated the lease as an operating lease and has allowed only the lease payments in
cost of service. The difference between the accrued expense and the lease payments allowed for
ratemaking purposes has been deferred and is being amortized to expense as ordered by the Georgia
PSC. See Note 1 under  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had capitalized lease obligations of $0.6 million and
$0.8 million, respectively, for its vehicles. However, for ratemaking purposes, these obligations
are treated as operating leases and, as such, lease payments are charged to expense as incurred.
The annual expense incurred for all capital leases in 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $8.7 million,
$9.7 million, and $9.2 million, respectively.

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock 

The Company currently has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common
stock authorized. The Company has shares of its Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and
common stock outstanding. The Company s Class A preferred stock ranks senior to the Company s
preference stock and common stock with respect to payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary
dissolution. The Company s preference stock ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the
payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Certain series of the Class A
preferred stock and preference stock are subject to redemption at the option of the Company on or
after a specified date (typically five or 10 years after the date of issuance) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the liquidation amount of the stock. In addition, the Company may redeem
the outstanding series of the preference stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
liquidation amount plus a make-whole premium based on the present value of the liquidation amount
and future dividends.

Dividend Restrictions 

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

Bank Credit Arrangements 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had credit arrangements with banks totaling $1.7 billion, of
which $12 million was used to support outstanding letters of credit. Of these facilities,
$595 million expire during 2010, with the remaining $1.1 billion expiring in

II-231 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

2012. $40 million of the facilities that expire in 2010 provides the option of converting
borrowings into a two-year term loan. The Company expects to renew its facilities, as needed,
prior to expiration. The agreements contain stated borrowing rates. All the agreements require
payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments or the maintenance of
compensating balances with the banks. Commitment fees average less than 3/8 of 1% for the Company.
Compensating balances are not legally restricted from withdrawal.

The credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to
capitalization (each as defined in the arrangements) to 65%. For purposes of these definitions,
indebtedness excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts and, in certain cases, other
hybrid securities. In addition, the credit arrangements contain cross default provisions that
would trigger an event of default if the Company defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified
threshold. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. None of
the arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.

The $1.7 billion of unused credit arrangements provides liquidity support to the Company s variable
rate pollution control revenue bonds and its commercial paper borrowings. The amount of variable
rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of December 31,
2009 was $901 million. In addition, the Company borrows under a commercial paper program. The
amount of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $324 million, $256
million, and $616 million, respectively. The Company also had $100 million of short-term bank
loans outstanding at December 31, 2008. Commercial paper and short-term bank loans are included in
notes payable on the balance sheets.

During 2009, the peak amount of short-term debt outstanding was $757 million and the average amount
outstanding was $348 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt in 2009 and 2008
was 0.4% and 2.9%, respectively.

7. COMMITMENTS 

Construction Program 

The Company currently estimates property additions to be approximately $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion,
and $2.8 billion in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. These amounts include $198 million, $109
million, and $115 million in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively, for construction expenditures
related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel included under  Fuel Commitments. 
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental statutes and
regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; Georgia PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of
capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be
fully recovered. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program. See Note 3 under  Construction  for additional
information.

Long-Term Service Agreements 

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for the combustion turbines at the Plant McIntosh
combined cycle facility. In summary, the LTSA stipulates that GE will perform all planned
inspections on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is
also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a
limit specified in the contract.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments to GE, which are subject to price escalation, are made quarterly based on actual operating
hours of the respective units. Total payments to GE under this agreement are currently estimated
at $171.5 million over the remaining term of the agreement, which is currently projected to be
approximately nine years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at the option
of the Company.

The Company has also entered into an LTSA with GE through 2014 for neutron monitoring system parts
and electronics at Plant Hatch. Total remaining payments to GE under this agreement are currently
estimated at $8 million. The contract contains cancellation provisions at the option of the
Company. Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any work are recorded as a prepayment in
the balance sheets. Work performed by GE is capitalized or charged to expense, as appropriate, net
of any joint owner billings, based on the nature of the work.

Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company has entered into a LTSA with Mitsubishi Power Systems Americas, Inc. (MPS) for the
purpose of providing certain parts and maintenance services for the three combined cycle units
under construction at Plant McDonough, which are scheduled to go into service in February 2011,
June 2011, and June 2012, respectively. The LTSA stipulates that MPS will perform all planned
maintenance on each covered unit which includes the cost of all materials and services. MPS is
also obligated to cover costs of unplanned maintenance on the gas turbines subject to limits
specified in the LTSA. This LTSA will begin in 2011 and is in effect through two major inspection
cycles per covered unit. Periodic payments to MPS are to be made quarterly and will also be made
based on the scheduled inspections for the respective covered units. Payments to MPS under this
agreement, which are subject to price escalation, are currently estimated to be $536.8 million for
the term of the agreement which is expected to be between 12 and 13 years. However, the LTSA
contains various termination provisions at the option of the Company.

Limestone Commitments 

As part of the Company s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used
in flue gas desulfurization equipment. Limestone contracts are structured with tonnage minimums
and maximums in order to account for fluctuations in coal burn and sulfur content. The Company has
a minimum contractual obligation of 3.3 million tons, equating to approximately $101.0 million
through 2019. Estimated expenditures (based on minimum contracted obligated dollars) over the next
five years are $19.3 million in 2010, $14.8 million in 2011, $15.2 million in 2012, $15.5 million
in 2013, and $16.0 million in 2014.

Fuel Commitments 

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these
contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide emissions
allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2009.

Total estimated minimum long-term commitments at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the Company s future needs. Total
charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense were $82 million, $77 million, and $79 million
for the years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent
for the Company and all of the other Southern Company traditional operating companies and Southern
Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power may
be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to
the creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has
entered into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional operating
companies to ensure the Company will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses,
liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under
these agreements.

Purchased Power Commitments 

The Company has commitments regarding a portion of a 5% interest in Plant Vogtle owned by MEAG
Power that are in effect until the latter of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated
maturity date of MEAG Power s bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for
capacity are required whether or not any capacity is available. The energy cost is a function of
each unit s

II-233 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

variable operating costs. Portions of the capacity payments relate to costs in excess of
Plant Vogtle s allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these portions at
the time of the disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity and energy is
included in purchased power from non-affiliates in the statements of income. Capacity payments
totaled $47 million, $48 million, and $46 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The
Company also has entered into other various long-term PPAs. Estimated total long-term obligations
under these commitments at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

Certain PPAs reflected in the table are accounted for as operating leases.

Operating Leases 

The Company has entered into various operating leases with various terms and expiration dates.
Rental expenses related to these operating leases totaled $43 million for 2009, $52 million for
2008, and $55 million for 2007.

At December 31, 2009, estimated minimum lease payments for these noncancelable operating leases
were as follows:

In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has obligations upon expiration of certain
rail car leases with respect to the residual value of the leased property. These leases expire in
2011 and the Company s maximum obligation is $39.7 million. At the termination of the leases, at
the Company s option, the Company may either exercise its purchase option or the property can be
sold to a third party. The Company expects that the fair market value of the leased property would
substantially reduce or eliminate the Company s payments under the residual value obligation. A
portion of the rail car lease obligations is shared with the joint owners of Plants Scherer and
Wansley. A majority of the rental expenses related to the rail car leases are fully recoverable
through the fuel cost recovery clause as ordered by the Georgia PSC and the remaining portion is
recovered through base rates.

Guarantees 

Alabama Power has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an installment sale
agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO s generating units, pursuant to which $24.5 million
principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds are outstanding. Alabama Power has also
guaranteed $50 million in senior notes issued by SEGCO. The Company has agreed to reimburse
Alabama Power for the pro rata portion of such obligations corresponding to the Company s then
proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO if Alabama Power is called upon to make such payment
under its guaranty.

As discussed earlier in this Note under  Operating Leases,  the Company has entered into certain
residual value guarantees related to rail car leases.

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN 

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2009, there were 1,954 current and
former employees of the Company participating in the stock option plan, and there were 21 million
shares of Southern Company common stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices
of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant.
Options granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the
date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are
eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards, a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company s stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company used historical
exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that options granted
to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date
fair value of stock options granted:

The Company s activity in the stock option plan for 2009 is summarized below:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2009 was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2009 as
stated above. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 5.9 years and 4.6 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $23.1 million and
$18.7 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 10 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $4.6 million, $4.2 million, and $6.0 million, respectively, with
the related tax benefit also recognized in income of $1.8 million, $1.6 million, and $2.3 million,
respectively.

II-235

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and exercise of Southern Company
stock options to the Company s employees are recognized in the Company s financial statements with
a corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007 was $1.7 million, $10.6 million, and $17.4 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit
realized by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises totaled $0.7 million,
$4.1 million, and $6.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007.

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE 

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), the Company maintains agreements of indemnity with
the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear
incident occurring at the Company s Plants Hatch and Vogtle. The Act provides funds up to $12.6
billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear
plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $375 million by American Nuclear Insurers
(ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could
be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. The
Company could be assessed up to $117.5 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates
but not more than an aggregate of $17.5 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each
reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for the Company,
based on its ownership and buyback interests, is $237 million, per incident, but not more than an
aggregate of $35 million to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum assessment
per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.
The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than October 29, 2013.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established
to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members  nuclear
generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL. In the event of a
loss, the amount of insurance available may not be adequate to cover property damage and other
incurred expenses.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during
a prolonged accidental outage at a member s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage,
subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit
limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL, subject to ownership limitations. Each
facility has elected a 12-week deductible waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed the
accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would be $50 million.

Claims resulting from terrorist acts are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to
normal policy limits). The aggregate, however, that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from
terrorist acts in any 12-month period is $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover
through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC
requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may
be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a
market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is
maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value
measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques used for fair value measurement.

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or
liabilities. 

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is
either directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of
the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If
there is little available market data, then the Company s own assumptions are the best
available information. 

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

As of December 31, 2009, assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
during the period, together with the level of the fair value hierarchy in which they fall, are
as follows:

(a) 
       
     Excludes receivables related to investment income, pending investment sales, and
payables related to pending investment purchases. 

Energy-related derivatives and interest rate derivatives primarily consist of
over-the-counter contracts. See Note 11 for additional information. The nuclear
decommissioning trust funds are invested in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income
securities. See Note 1 under  Nuclear Decommissioning  for additional information. All of
these financial instruments and investments are valued primarily using the market approach.

notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness with a maturity not exceeding 13
months from the date of purchase. The commingled funds will, however, maintain a dollar-weighted
average portfolio maturity of 90 days or less. The assets may be longer term investment grade
fixed income obligations having a maximum five year final maturity with put features or floating
rates with a reset date of 13 months or less. The primary objective for the commingled funds is a
high level of current income consistent with stability of principal and liquidity.

The Company s financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal fair value at
December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2).

11. DERIVATIVES 

The Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk. To
manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets its exposures, where
possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. The Company s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily
for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are
recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.

Energy-Related Derivatives 

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
manages fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of the Georgia PSC, through the use
of financial derivative contracts.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in gas prices, the Company
may enter into fixed-price contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of
contracts are priced at market.

II-238 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Georgia Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for in one of two methods:

Regulatory Hedges    Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory
hedges relate primarily to the Company s fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are
initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included
in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through
the fuel cost recovery clauses. 

Not Designated    Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as
incurred. 

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial
settlement, which is both common and prevalent within the electric industry. When an
energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is
reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual
price of the underlying goods being delivered.

At December 31, 2009, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas
positions for the Company, together with the longest hedge date over which it is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest date
for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

Interest Rate Derivatives 

The Company also enters into interest rate derivatives, which include forward-starting interest
rate swaps, to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives related to existing
variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness.

For cash flow hedges, the fair value gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income
(OCI) and are reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged transactions affect earnings.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges of existing debt as follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company realized net losses of $19 million upon
termination of certain interest rate derivatives at the same time it issued debt. The effective
portion of these losses has been deferred in OCI and is being amortized to interest expense over
the life of the original interest rate derivative, reflecting the period in which the forecasted
hedged transaction affects earnings.

The estimated pre-tax losses that will be reclassified from OCI to interest expense for the next
12-month period ending December 31, 2010 are $12.8 million. The Company has deferred gains and
losses that are expected to be amortized into earnings through 2037.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the pre-tax effect of interest rate
derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments on the statements of income were as
follows:

There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.

For all years presented, the pre-tax effect of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging
instruments on the statements of income were immaterial.

Contingent Features 

The Company has certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in
the event of various credit rating changes of certain affiliated companies. At December 31, 2009,
the fair value of derivative liabilities with contingent features was $17 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no collateral posted with its derivative counterparties;
however, because of the joint and several liability features underlying these derivatives, the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features,
at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, is $33.3 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Gulf Power Company 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Gulf Power
Company (the  Company ) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-268 to II-306) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Gulf Power Company at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

OVERVIEW 

Business Activities 

Gulf Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity
to retail customers within its traditional service area located in northwest Florida and to
wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s business of selling
electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment,
to maintain energy sales given the effects of the recession, and to effectively manage and secure
timely recovery of rising costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand
growth, increasingly stringent environmental standards, fuel prices, and storm restoration costs.
Appropriately balancing the need to recover these increasing costs with customer prices will
continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future.

Key Performance Indicators 

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to over 425,000
customers, the Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators include
customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on
preference stock. The Company s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its
customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high
reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability
indicators to evaluate the Company s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of plant availability
and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are greatest.
The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours.
The 2009 Peak Season EFOR of 2.11% was better than the target. Transmission and distribution
system reliability performance is measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance
targets for reliability are set internally based on historical performance, expected weather
conditions, and expected capital expenditures. The performance for 2009 was better than the target
for these reliability measures. The performance for net income after dividends on preference stock
in 2009 was below target. Net income after dividends on preference stock is the primary measure of
the Company s financial performance.

The Company s 2009 results compared with its targets for some of these key indicators are reflected
in the following chart:

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company s financial performance.

Earnings 

The Company s 2009 net income after dividends on preference stock was $111.2 million, an increase
of $12.9 million from the previous year. In 2008, net income after dividends on preference stock
was $98.3 million, an increase of $14.2 million from the previous year. In 2007, net income after
dividends on preference stock was $84.1 million, an increase of $8.1 million from the previous
year. The increase in net income after dividends on preference stock in 2009 was due primarily to
increased allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) equity, which is non-taxable, and
decreased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, partially offset by unfavorable weather and
a decline in sales. The increase in net income after dividends on preference stock in 2008 was due
primarily to higher wholesale revenues from non-affiliates, increased AFUDC equity, and a gain on
the sale of assets.

II-247 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The increase in net income after dividends on preference stock in 2007 was due primarily to
increases in retail revenues, earnings on additional investments in environmental controls through
the environment cost recovery provision, and related AFUDC equity, partially offset by non-fuel
operating expenses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

A condensed statement of income follows:

Operating Revenues  

Operating revenues for 2009 were $1.3 billion, a decrease of $85.0 million from the previous year.
The following table summarizes the significant changes in operating revenues for the past three
years:

Retail revenues decreased $14.2 million, or 1.3%, in 2009, increased $114.4 million, or 11.4%, in
2008, and increased $54.3 million, or 5.7%, in 2007.

II-248 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing include cost recovery provisions for energy
conservation costs and environmental compliance costs. Annually, the Company petitions the Florida
Public Service Commission (PSC) for recovery of projected costs, including any true-up amount from
prior periods, and approved rates are implemented each January. The recovery provisions include
related expenses and a return on average net investment. See Note 3 to the financial statements
under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Environmental Cost Recovery  for additional information. See
 Energy Sales  below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes
relating to sales growth (or decline) and weather.

Fuel and other cost recovery provisions include fuel expenses, the energy component of purchased
power costs, and purchased power capacity costs. Annually, the Company petitions the Florida PSC
for recovery of projected fuel and purchased power costs, including any true-up amount from prior
periods, and approved rates are implemented each January. Cost recovery provisions also include
revenues related to the recovery of storm damage restoration costs. The recovery provisions
generally equal the related expenses and have no material effect on net income. See Note 1 to the
financial statements under  Revenues  and  Property Damage Reserve  and Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  for additional information.

Total wholesale revenues were $126.2 million in 2009, a decrease of $77.8 million, or 38.2%,
compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased energy sales to affiliates at a lower cost per
kilowatt-hour (KWH). Total wholesale revenues were $204.1 million in 2008, an increase of $7.4
million, or 3.7%, compared to 2007 primarily due to higher capacity revenues associated with new
and existing territorial wholesale contracts with non-affiliated companies. Total wholesale
revenues were $196.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $8.5 million, or 4.2%, compared to 2006
primarily due to decreased energy sales to affiliates at a lower cost per KWH supplied by
lower-cost generating resources.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of available
energy compared to the cost of the
Company and Southern Company system-owned generation, demand for energy with the Southern Company
service territory, and availability of Southern Company system generation.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates include unit power sales under long-term contracts
to other Florida utilities. Wholesale revenues from contracts have both capacity and energy
components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment.
Energy is generally sold at variable cost. The capacity and energy components under these unit
power sales contracts were as follows:

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
system company. These affiliated sales, along with purchases from affiliates, are made in
accordance with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings,
since the energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by
revenues through the Company s fuel cost recovery clause.

Other operating revenues increased $7.1 million, or 11.3%, in 2009 primarily due to other energy
services and franchise fees, offset by transmission and distribution network services and timber
sales. Other operating revenues increased $5.6 million, or 9.9%, in 2008 primarily due to
transmission and distribution network services and other energy services. Other operating revenues
increased $10.2 million, or 21.8%, in 2007 primarily due to other energy services and an increase
in franchise fees. The increased revenues from other energy services did not have a material
impact on earnings since they were generally offset by associated expenses. Franchise fees have no
impact on net income.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Energy Sales  

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to
year. KWH sales for 2009 and the percent change by year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers.

Residential energy sales decreased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the recessionary
economy. Residential energy sales decreased 2.3% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to
decreased customer usage as a result of a slowing economy, partially offset by more favorable
weather. Residential energy sales increased 0.9% in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to more
favorable weather conditions and customer growth, partially offset by customer response to higher
prices.

Commercial energy sales decreased 1.6% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the recessionary
economy and a decrease in the number of customers. The change in commercial energy sales in 2008
compared to 2007 was immaterial. Commercial energy sales increased 3.3% in 2007 compared to 2006
primarily due to more favorable weather conditions and customer growth.

Industrial energy sales decreased 21.9% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to increased
customer co-generation due to the lower cost of natural gas in 2009, decreased demand, and a
business closure due to the recessionary economy. Industrial energy sales increased 7.9% in 2008
compared to 2007 primarily due to decreased customer co-generation due to the higher cost of
natural gas .  Industrial energy sales decreased 4.1% in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a
conversion project by a major forest products manufacturer and a production process change by a
major petroleum company.

Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates decreased 0.2% in 2009, decreased 18.4% in 2008, and
increased 7.1% in 2007, each compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2009 was primarily a
result of the recessionary economy. The changes in 2008 and 2007 were primarily the result of
fluctuations in the fuel cost to produce energy sold to non-affiliated utilities under both
long-term and short-term contracts. The degree to which prices for oil and natural gas, which are
the primary fuel sources for these customers, differ from the Company s fuel costs will influence
these changes in sales. The fluctuations in sales have a minimal effect on earnings because the
energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

Wholesale energy sales to affiliates decreased 53.5% in 2009, 35.1% in 2008, and 1.8% in 2007,
compared to prior years. The decrease in 2009 was primarily a result of the recessionary economy.
The decreases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to the availability of lower cost generation
resources at affiliated companies.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses  

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generating units. Additionally, the Company purchases a portion of its
electricity needs from the wholesale market.

Details of the Company s electricity generated and purchased were as follows:

* 
       
     Fuel includes fuel purchased by the Company for tolling agreements where power is
generated by the provider
and is included in purchased power when determining the average cost of purchased power. 

Total fuel and purchased power expenses were $665.4 million in 2009, a decrease of $79.6
million, or 10.7%, below the prior year costs. The net decrease in fuel and purchased power
expenses was primarily due to a $53.3 million decrease related to total KWHs generated and
purchased and a $26.3 million decrease in the cost of energy primarily resulting from a decrease in
the average cost of natural gas. Total fuel and purchased power expenses were $745.0 million in
2008, an increase of $100.1 million, or 15.5%, above the prior year costs. The net increase in
fuel and purchased power expenses was due to a $130.5 million increase in the average cost of fuel
and purchased power as well as a $34.9 million increase related to KWHs purchased, offset by a
$65.3 million decrease related to KWHs generated. Total fuel and purchased power expenses were
$644.9 million in 2007, an increase of $36.2 million, or 5.9%, above the prior year costs. The net
increase in fuel and purchased power expenses was due to a $32.6 million increase in the average
cost of fuel and purchased power as well as a $10.1 million increase related to KWHs generated,
offset by a $6.5 million decrease related to KWHs purchased.

Fuel expense was $573.4 million in 2009, a decrease of $62.2 million, or 9.8%, below the prior year
costs. This decrease was primarily the result of a 41.9% decrease in the average cost of natural
gas and a 12.6% decrease in KWHs generated as a result of lower demand, partially offset by an
increase of 19.3% in the average cost of coal per KWH generated. Fuel expense was $635.6 million
in 2008, an increase of $62.2 million, or 10.9%, above the prior year costs. This increase was the
result of a 25.3% increase in the average cost of fuel, offset by an 11.4% decrease in KWHs
generated. Fuel expense was $573.4 million in 2007, an increase of $38.5 million, or 7.2%, above
the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a 5.2% increase in the average cost of fuel
and a 1.9% increase in KWHs generated.

Purchased power expense was $92.0 million in 2009, a decrease of $17.4 million, or 15.9%, below the
prior year costs. This decrease was primarily the result of a 27.1% decrease in the average cost
per KWH purchased, offset by a 24.8% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased. Purchased power
expense was $109.4 million in 2008, an increase of $37.9 million, or 53.0%, above the prior year
costs. This increase was the result of a 48.8% increase in total KWHs purchased and a 2.8%
increase in the average cost per net KWH. Purchased power expense was $71.5 million in 2007, a
decrease of $2.3 million, or 3.1%, below the prior year costs. This decrease was the result of an
8.9% decrease in total KWHs purchased, offset by a 6.3% increase in the average cost per net KWH.

Coal prices continued to be influenced by worldwide demand from developing countries, as well as
increased mining and fuel transportation costs. While coal prices reached unprecedented high levels
in 2008, the recessionary economy pushed prices downward in 2009. However, the lower prices did
not fully offset the higher priced coal already in inventory and under long-term contract. Demand
for natural gas in the United States also was affected by the recessionary economy leading to
significantly lower natural gas prices.

Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
Company s fuel cost recovery provisions. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Fuel Cost
Recovery  herein for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses  

In 2009, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $17.2 million, or 6.2%, compared to
the prior year primarily due to a $14.4 million decrease in administrative and general expense,
most of which is related to decreased storm recovery costs, and a $6.7 million decrease in power
generation, most of which is related to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and cost containment
activities in an effort to offset the effects of the recessionary economy. This decrease was
partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in other energy services. In 2008, other operations
and maintenance expenses increased $7.1 million, or 2.6%, compared to the prior year primarily due
to an $8.2 million increase in scheduled and unscheduled maintenance at generation facilities. In
2007, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $10.9 million, or 4.2%, compared to the
prior year primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in other energy services and a $4.3 million
increase in severance costs associated with a reorganization. The increased expenses from other
energy services did not have a material impact on earnings since they were generally offset by
associated revenue. In 2007, the Company offered both voluntary and involuntary severance to a
number of employees in connection with a reorganization of certain functions.

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.6 million, or 10.1%, in 2009 compared to the
prior year primarily due to additions of environmental control projects at Plant Crist and Plant
Scherer and other net additions to generation and distribution facilities. Depreciation and
amortization expense decreased $0.8 million, or 0.9%, in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily
as a result of a $3.8 million gain on the sale of a building. The decrease was partially offset by
an increase of $3.0 million in depreciation due to net additions to generation and distribution
facilities. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $3.6 million, or 4.0%, in 2007
compared to the prior year primarily due to new depreciation rates implemented in January 2007.

Taxes
Other Than Income Taxes  

Taxes other than income taxes increased $7.3 million, or 8.3%, in 2009 compared to the prior
year primarily due to a $5.6 million increase in gross receipts and franchise taxes, which have no
impact on net income, and a $1.6 million increase in property taxes. Taxes other than income taxes
increased $4.2 million, or 5.1%, in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $1.9 million
decrease in 2007 related to the resolution of a dispute regarding property taxes in Monroe County,
Georgia and a $1.9 million increase in franchise and gross receipt taxes. Taxes other than income
taxes increased $3.2 million, or 4.0%, in 2007 compared to the prior year primarily due to
increases in franchise and gross receipts taxes.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction Equity  

AFUDC equity increased $13.8 million, or 138.8%, in 2009 compared to the prior year primarily due
to construction of environmental control projects at Plant Crist and Plant Scherer. AFUDC equity
increased $7.6 million, or 319.9%, in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to construction
of environmental control projects at Plant Crist and Plant Scherer. AFUDC equity increased
$2.0 million, or 554.0%, in 2007 compared to the prior year primarily due to construction of an
environmental control project at Plant Crist. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Environmental
Matters   Environmental Statutes and Regulations  herein and Note 1 to the financial statements
under  Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)  for additional information.

Interest Income  

Interest income decreased $2.7 million, or 86.6%, in 2009 compared to the prior year primarily due
to decreases in interest received related to the recovery of financing costs associated with the
fuel clause. Interest income decreased $2.2 million, or 41%, in 2008 primarily as a result of
lower variable interest rates charged against the under recovered fuel balance and a decrease in
the property damage reserve balance. Interest income increased $0.1 million, or 2.3%, in 2007
compared to the prior year primarily due to interest received related to the recovery of financing
costs associated with the fuel clause and incurred costs for storm damage activity as approved by
the Florida PSC. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  herein and
Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  for
additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized  

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $4.7 million, or 11.0%, in 2009 compared to
the prior year as the result of an increase in capitalization of AFUDC debt related to the
construction of environmental control projects at Plant Crist and Plant Scherer. Interest expense,
net of amounts capitalized decreased $1.6 million, or 3.5%, in 2008 compared to the prior year as
the result of an increase in capitalization of AFUDC debt related to the construction of
environmental control projects and the redemption of $41.2 million of long-term debt payable to an
affiliated trust in 2007. These decreases were offset by the issuance of a $110 million term loan
agreement in 2008. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $0.5 million, or 1.2%,
in 2007 compared to the prior year and was not material.

Income Taxes  

Income taxes decreased $1.1 million, or 2.0%, in 2009, compared to the prior year primarily due to
the tax benefit associated with an increase in AFUDC, which is non-taxable, partially offset by
higher earnings before taxes. Income taxes increased $7.0 million, or 14.9%, in 2008, compared to
the prior year primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes and a decrease in the federal
production activities deduction, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with an increase in
AFUDC, which is non-taxable. Income taxes increased $1.8 million, or 4.0%, in 2007, compared to
the prior year primarily as a result of higher earnings before income taxes. See Note 5 to the
financial statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for additional information.

Effects of Inflation 

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and
projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs
could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on the
Company s results of operations has not been substantial.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 

General 

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in the
Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by the
Florida PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to wholesale
electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are
regulated by the FERC. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically
within certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates   Electric Utility Regulation  herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s business of selling electricity.
These factors include the Company s ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that
continues to allow for the recovery of prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing costs.
Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining energy sales, which is
subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts
with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity,
the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the Company s service
area. Recessionary conditions have negatively impacted sales and are expected to continue to have
a negative impact, particularly to industrial and commercial customers. The timing and extent of
the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

Environmental Matters 

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Environmental Matters  for additional
information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power) and Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), alleging
that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act
and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. These actions were filed
concurrently with the issuance of notices of violation of the NSR provisions to the Company with
respect to the Company s Plant Crist. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action,
the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations
occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
including one facility co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The original action, now solely against Georgia Power, has been administratively
closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome could require substantial
capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be
determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. Such
expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the

II-254 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on lack
of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations  

General 

The Company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning   Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2009, the Company had invested approximately $1.1 billion in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $343 million, $296 million, and $124 million for
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $113 million, $195
million, and $194 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The Company s compliance
strategy can be affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations; the
cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; and the Company s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY    Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations  herein.

The Florida Legislature has adopted legislation that allows a utility to petition the Florida PSC
for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs that are not being recovered through base
rates or any other recovery mechanism. The legislation is discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Environmental Cost Recovery.  Substantially all of
the costs for the Clean Air Act and other new environmental legislation discussed below are
expected to be recovered through the environmental cost recovery clause.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and
health concerns could also significantly affect the Company. Although new or revised environmental
legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the Company s operations, the full impact of
any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality 

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2009, the Company had spent approximately $834 million
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are scheduled to be
installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance with existing
regulations, and meet new requirements.

The EPA regulates ground level ozone through implementation of an eight-hour ozone air quality
standard. No area within the Company s service area is currently designated as nonattainment under
the eight-hour ozone standard. In March 2008, however, the

II-255 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

EPA issued a final rule establishing a more stringent eight-hour ozone standard, and on January 6,
2010, the EPA proposed further reductions in the standard. The EPA is expected to finalize the
revised standard in August 2010 and require state implementation plans for any nonattainment areas
by December 2013. The revised eight-hour ozone standard is expected to result in designation of
new nonattainment areas within the Company s service territory.

During 2005, the EPA s annual fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within Georgia. State plans for addressing the nonattainment designations for
this standard could require further reductions in SO 2  and NO x  emissions from
power plants, including plants owned in part by the Company. On December 8, 2009, the EPA also
proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for SO 2 . The EPA is
expected to finalize the revised SO 2  standard in June 2010.

Twenty-eight eastern states, including the States of Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi, are subject
to the requirements of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The rule calls for additional
reductions of NO x  and/or SO 2  to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and
2015. In July 2008 and December 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit issued decisions invalidating certain aspects of CAIR, but left CAIR compliance
requirements in place while the EPA develops a revised rule. The States of Florida, Georgia, and
Mississippi have completed plans to implement CAIR, and emissions reductions are being accomplished
by the installation of emissions controls at the Company s coal-fired facilities and/or by the
purchase of emissions allowances. The EPA is expected to issue a proposed CAIR replacement rule in
July 2010.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule was finalized in July 2005, with a goal of restoring natural
visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064.
The rule involves the application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources
built between 1962 and 1977, and any additional emissions reductions necessary for each designated
area to achieve reasonable progress toward the natural conditions goal by 2018 and for each
ten-year period thereafter. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to
determine that CAIR satisfies BART requirements for SO 2  and NO x , and no
additional controls beyond CAIR are anticipated to be necessary at the Company s facilities.
States have completed or are currently completing implementation plans for BART compliance and
other measures required to achieve the first phase of reasonable progress.

The EPA is currently developing a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule for coal and
oil-fired electric generating units, which will likely address numerous Hazardous Air Pollutants,
including mercury. In March 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), a cap and
trade program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. In February
2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the CAMR. In a
separate proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the EPA entered into a
proposed consent decree that requires the EPA to issue a proposed MACT rule by March 16, 2011, and
a final rule by November 16, 2011.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standards, the fine particulate matter nonattainment
designations, and future revisions to CAIR, the SO 2  standard, the Clean Air Visibility
Rule, and the MACT rule for electric generating units on the Company cannot be determined at this
time and will depend on the specific provisions of the final rules, resolution of any legal
challenges, and the development and implementation of rules at the state level. However, these
additional regulations could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect
future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and
financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO 2
 and NO x  emissions controls within the next several years to ensure continued
compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

Water Quality 

In July 2004, the EPA published final regulations under the Clean Water Act to reduce impingement
and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
water intake structures. The use of cost-benefit analysis in the rule was ultimately appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 1, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA could consider
costs in arriving at its standards and in providing variances from those standards for existing
intake structures. The EPA is now in the process of revising the regulations. While the U.S.
Supreme Court s decision may ultimately result in greater flexibility for demonstrating compliance
with the standards, the full scope of the regulations will depend on further rulemaking by the EPA
and the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

II-256 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

On December 28, 2009, the EPA announced its determination that revision of the current effluent
guidelines for steam electric power plants is warranted and proposed a plan to adopt such revisions
by 2013. New wastewater treatment requirements are expected and may result in the installation of
additional controls on certain Company facilities. The impact of revised guidelines will depend on
the studies conducted in connection with the rulemaking, as well as the specific requirements of
the final rule, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation 

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Included in this amount are costs associated with remediation of
the Company s substation sites. These projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery
through the environmental cost recovery clause; therefore, there is no impact to the Company s net
income as a result of these liabilities. The Company may be liable for some or all required
cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under  Environmental Matters   Environmental Remediation  for additional
information.

Coal Combustion Byproducts 

The EPA is currently evaluating whether additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts is
merited under federal solid and hazardous waste laws. The EPA has collected information from the
electric utility industry on surface impoundment safety and conducted on-site inspections at three
Southern Company system facilities as part of its evaluation. The Company has a routine and robust
inspection program in place to ensure the integrity of its coal ash surface impoundments. The EPA
is expected to issue a proposal regarding additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts in
early 2010. The impact of these additional regulations on the Company will depend on the specific
provisions of the final rule and cannot be determined at this time. However, additional regulation
of coal combustion byproducts could have a significant impact on the Company s management,
beneficial use, and disposal of such byproducts and could result in significant additional
compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

Global Climate Issues  

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions, renewable energy standards, and energy efficiency standards continue to be considered in
Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by
the current Administration. On June 26, 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009
(ACES), which would impose mandatory greenhouse gas restrictions through implementation of a cap
and trade program, a renewable energy standard, and other measures, was passed by the House of
Representatives. ACES would require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions on a national basis to
a level that is 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, and 83% below 2005
levels by 2050. In addition, ACES would provide for renewable energy standards of 6% by 2012 and
20% by 2020. Similar legislation is being considered by the Senate. The financial and operational
impact of such legislation, if enacted, will depend on a variety of factors. These factors include
the specific greenhouse gas emissions limits or renewable energy requirements, the timing of
implementation of these limits or requirements, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the
level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and
commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions,
the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any),
the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and cost recovery through regulated rates. There can be
no assurance that any legislation will be enacted or as to the ultimate form of any legislation.
Additional or alternative legislation may be adopted as well.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published
a final determination, which became effective on January 14, 2010, that certain greenhouse gas
emissions from new motor vehicles endanger public health and welfare due to climate change. On
September 28, 2009, the EPA published a proposed rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from new
motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has stated that once this rule is effective, it
will cause carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to become regulated pollutants under the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) preconstruction permit program and the Title V
operating permit program, which both apply to power plants. As a result, the construction of new
facilities or the major modification of existing facilities could trigger the requirement for a PSD
permit and the installation of the best available control technology for carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases. The EPA also published a proposed rule governing how these programs would be
applied to stationary sources, including power plants, on October 27, 2009. The EPA has stated
that it expects to finalize these proposed rules in March

II-257 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

2010. The ultimate outcome of the endangerment finding and these proposed rules cannot be
determined at this time and will depend on additional regulatory action and any legal challenges.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. A nonbinding agreement was announced during the most recent round of
negotiations in December 2009 that included a pledge from both developed and developing countries
to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome and impact of the international negotiations
cannot be determined at this time.

Although the outcome of federal, state, or international initiatives cannot be determined at this
time, mandatory restrictions on the Company s greenhouse gas emissions or requirements relating to
renewable energy or energy efficiency on the federal or state level are likely to result in
significant additional compliance costs, including significant capital expenditures. These costs
could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions, and could result in the retirement
of a significant number of coal-fired generating units. See Item 1   BUSINESS    Rate Matters  
Integrated Resource Planning  for additional information. Also, additional compliance costs and
costs related to unit retirements could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Further, higher costs that are
recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could
negatively impact results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In 2008, the total carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel-fired electric generating units
owned by the Company were approximately 14 million metric tons. The preliminary estimate of carbon
dioxide emissions from these units in 2009 is approximately 11 million metric tons. The level of
carbon dioxide emissions from year to year will be dependent on the level of generation and mix of
fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability of generating units.

The Company continues to evaluate its future energy and emissions profiles and is participating in
voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help develop and advance technology to
reduce emissions.

PSC Matters 

General  

The Company s rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory
oversight of the Florida PSC. The Company s rates are a combination of base rates and several
separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery
clauses address such items as fuel and purchased energy costs, purchased power capacity costs,
energy conservation, and demand side management programs, and the costs of compliance with
environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery
clauses are recovered through the Company s base rates.

On November 2, 2009, the Florida PSC approved the Company s annual rate requests for its purchased
power capacity, energy conservation, and environmental compliance cost recovery factors for 2010.
On December 1, 2009, the Florida PSC approved the Company s annual rate request for its 2010 fuel
cost recovery factor, which includes both fuel and purchased energy cost. The net effect of the
approved changes to the Company s cost recovery factors for 2010 is a 3.9% rate increase for
residential customers using 1,000 KWHs per month. Revenues for all cost recovery clauses, as
recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and
amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changing the billing factor has no
significant effect on the Company s revenues or net income, but does impact annual cash flow. See
Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under  Revenues  and  Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel
Cost Recovery,  respectively.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The Company petitions for fuel cost recovery rates to be approved by the Florida PSC on an annual
basis. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the under recovered balance was $2.4 million and
$96.7 million, respectively. The change in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the 2009 fuel
cost recovery factors and resulting revenue collected in the period and a higher percentage of
natural gas-fired generation which cost less than projected. The Company continuously monitors the
over or under recovered fuel cost balance in light of the inherent variability in fuel costs. If
the projected fuel cost over or under recovery exceeds 10% of the projected fuel revenue applicable
for the period, the Company is required to notify the Florida PSC and indicate if an adjustment to
the fuel cost recovery factor is being requested.

II-258

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Purchased Power Capacity Recovery  

The Florida PSC allows the Company to recover its costs for capacity purchased from other power
producers under power purchase agreements (PPAs) through a separate cost recovery component or
factor in the Company s retail energy rates. Like the other specific cost recovery factors
included in the Company s retail energy rates, the rates for purchased capacity are set annually on
a calendar year basis. When the Company enters into a new PPA, it is reviewed and approved by the
Florida PSC for cost recovery purposes. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had an over
recovered purchased power capacity balance of approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, which is included in other regulatory liabilities, current in the balance sheets.

In March 2009, the Company entered into a PPA (the Agreement) with Shell Energy North America (US),
L.P. (Shell) conditioned on subsequent review and approval of the Company s participation by the
Florida PSC. The Florida PSC approved the Agreement through an order that became final in October
2009. As a result, the Agreement became effective on November 1, 2009. The Agreement will
terminate on May 24, 2023, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. Under the terms
of the Agreement, the Company will be entitled to all of the capacity and energy from an
approximately 885 MW combined cycle power plant (the Plant) located in Autauga County, Alabama that
is owned and operated by Tenaska Alabama II Partners, L.P. (Tenaska). Shell is entitled to all of
the capacity and energy from the Plant under a 20-year Energy Conversion Agreement between Shell
and Tenaska that expires on May 24, 2023. Payments under the Agreement will be material.
However, these costs have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery through the Company s fuel
clause and purchased power capacity clause; therefore, no material impact is expected on the
Company s net income. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY    Capital Requirements and
Contractual Obligations  herein and Note 7 to the financial statements under  Fuel and Purchased
Power Commitments  for additional information.

Environmental Cost Recovery  

In August 2007, the Florida PSC voted to approve a stipulation among the Company, the Office of
Public Counsel, and the Florida Industrial Power Users Group regarding the Company s plan for
complying with certain federal and state regulations addressing air quality. The Company s
environmental compliance plan as filed in March 2007 contemplated implementation of specific
projects identified in the plan from 2007 through 2018. The stipulation covers all elements of the
current plan that are scheduled to be implemented in the 2007 through 2011 timeframe. On April 1,
2009, the Company filed an update to the plan, which was approved by the Florida PSC on November 2,
2009. The Florida PSC acknowledged that the costs associated with the Company s CAIR and Clean Air
Visibility Rule compliance plans are eligible for recovery through the environmental cost recovery
clause. Annually, the Company seeks recovery of projected costs including any true-up amounts from
prior periods. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the over recovered environmental balance was
approximately $11.7 million and $71 thousand, respectively, which is included in other regulatory
liabilities, current in the balance sheets. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY    Capital
Requirements and Contractual Obligations  herein, Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail
Regulatory  Matters    Environmental Cost Recovery,  and Note 7 to the financial statements under
 Construction Program  for additional information.

Legislation 

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives, which could have a significant impact on the future cash flow
and net income of the Company. The Company s cash flow reduction to 2009 tax payments as a result
of the bonus depreciation provisions of the ARRA was approximately $19 million. On December 8,
2009, President Obama announced proposals to accelerate job growth that include an extension of the
bonus depreciation provision for the ARRA for 2010, which could have a significant impact on the
future cash flow and net income of the Company.

On October 27, 2009, Southern Company and its subsidiaries received notice that an award of $165
million had been granted, of which $15.5 million relates to the Company, under the ARRA grant
application for transmission and distribution automation and modernization projects pending final
negotiations. The Company continues to assess the other financial implications of the ARRA.

The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have passed separate bills related to
healthcare reform. Both bills include a provision that would make Medicare Part D subsidy
reimbursements taxable. If enacted into law, this provision could have a significant negative
impact on the Company s net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under  Other
Postretirement Benefits  for additional information.

The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

II-259 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Income Tax Matters 

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production activities net
income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to
the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate
thereafter. See Note 5 to the financial statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for additional
information.

Other Matters 

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could
affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company s business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment such as regulation
of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various
types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased
generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury and other claims for
damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law nuisance claims for
injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the
Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.
See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company s
Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation  

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Florida PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies accounting standards which require the
financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process,
the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they
would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of
expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery
through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on the
Company s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company s results of operations than
they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities
have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and
liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could
materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact
the Company s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations  

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure

II-260 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), records
reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or
conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially
affect the Company s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. 

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in IRS or state revenue department
interpretations of existing regulations. 

Identification of additional sites that require environmental remediation or the filing of
other complaints in which the Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party. 

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or complaints in which the Company
may be named as a defendant. 

Resolution or progression of new or existing matters through the legislative process, the
court systems, the IRS, state revenue departments, the FERC, or the EPA. 

Unbilled Revenues  

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation
patterns, and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be
unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled
revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company s
results of operations.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

The Company s calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a
number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates,
expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and
other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest
and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan
assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ
from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore,
generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the
Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefits
costs and obligations.

Key elements in determining the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit expense in
accordance with GAAP are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used
to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods.
The expected long-term return on postretirement benefit plan assets is based on the Company s
investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that
considers external actuarial advice. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets
by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to the Company s
target asset allocation. The Company discounts the future cash flows related to its
postretirement benefit plans using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted
average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that
correspond to expected benefit payments.

A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption would result in a $0.8 million or less
change in total benefit expense and a $12 million or less change in projected obligations.

New Accounting Standards 

Variable Interest Entities  

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on the consolidation of
variable interest entities, which replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation
for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity
with an approach that is primarily qualitative, requires ongoing assessments of whether an
enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requires additional
disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities. The Company adopted
this new guidance effective January 1, 2010, with no material impact on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

Overview 

The Company s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2009. Throughout the turmoil in
the financial markets, the Company has maintained adequate access to capital without drawing on any
of its bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial paper program and variable rate
pollution control revenue bonds. The Company intends to continue to monitor its access to
short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future
capital and liquidity needs. Market rates for committed credit increased in 2009, and the Company
may continue to be subject to higher costs as its existing facilities are replaced or renewed.
Total committed credit fees for the Company average less than   3  / 4  of 1% per year. See  Sources of
Capital  and  Financing Activities  herein for additional information.

The Company s investments in pension trust funds remained stable in value as of December 31, 2009.
The Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust
fund is 2012 and such contribution could be significant. The projections of the amount vary
significantly depending on key variables including future trust fund performance and cannot be
determined at this time.

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $194.2 million, $147.9 million, and
$217.0 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The $46.3 million increase in net cash
provided from operating activities in 2009 was primarily due to a $134.5 million reduction in
accounts receivable related to fuel cost, partially offset by a $40.5 million decrease in deferred
income taxes and a $38.4 million increase in fuel inventory. The $69.1 million decrease in net
cash provided from operating activities in 2008 was due primarily to a $61.0 million increase in
cash used for the under recovered regulatory clause related to fuel. The $73.6 million increase in
net cash provided from operating activities in 2007 was due primarily to increased cash inflows for
fuel cost recovery.

Net cash used for investing activities totaled $468.4 million, $348.7 million, and $239.3 million
for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The increases in cash used for investing activities were
primarily due to gross property additions to utility plant of $450.4 million, $390.7 million, and
$239.3 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Funds for the Company s property additions
were provided by operating activities, capital contributions, and other financing activities.

Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $279.4 million, $198.8 million, and $20.2
million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The $80.6 million increase in net cash provided
from financing activities in 2009 was due primarily to $258.4 million in debt issuances and cash
raised from a common stock sale, partially offset by a $157.0 million decrease in notes payable.
The $178.6 million increase in net cash provided from financing activities in 2008 was due
primarily to the issuance of $110 million in long-term debt and $50 million in short-term debt, and
a $49.1 million change in commercial paper cash flows in 2008. The increase was partially offset
by the issuance of $85 million in senior notes in 2007. The $4.5 million decrease in net cash
provided from financing activities in 2007 was due primarily to a $105.6 million change in
commercial paper cash flows and a $25.0 million decrease in senior note proceeds. These decreases
were partially offset by the issuance of $80 million in common stock and $45 million in preference
stock in 2007.

Significant
balance sheet changes in 2009 include an increase of $374.1 million in total property,
plant, and equipment, primarily related to environmental control projects; the issuance of $140.0
million in senior notes; the issuance of common stock to Southern Company for $135.0 million; the
issuance of $130.4 million of pollution control revenue bonds, with a related restricted cash
balance of $6.3 million; an increase in fossil fuel stock of $75.5 million; an increase in customer
accounts receivable and unbilled revenues of $6.4 million; and a $94.4 million decrease in under
recovered regulatory clause revenues primarily related to fuel.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The
Company s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 43.4%
in 2009, 42.9% in 2008, and 45.3% in 2007. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional
information.

The Company has received investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to its debt and preference stock. See SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA and  Credit
Rating Risk  herein for additional information regarding the Company s security ratings.

Sources of Capital 

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, security
issuances, term loans, and short-term indebtedness. However, the type and timing of any future
financings, if needed, will depend on market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the Florida PSC pursuant to its rules and
regulations. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files
registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the Florida PSC, as well
as the amounts, if any, registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate
filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information. The Southern
Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued use of
short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the
seasonality of the business. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has
various internal and external sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2009, the Company had
approximately $9 million of cash and cash equivalents, along with $220 million of unused committed
lines of credit with banks to meet its short-term cash needs. These bank credit arrangements will
expire in 2010 and $70 million contain provisions allowing one-year term loans executable at
expiration. The Company plans to renew these lines of credit during 2010 prior to their
expiration. In addition, the Company has substantial cash flow from operating activities and
access to the capital markets, including a commercial paper program, to meet liquidity needs. See
Note 6 to the financial statements under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of the Company and the other
traditional operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are
loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the
benefit of any other traditional operating company. The obligations of each company under these
arrangements are several; there is no cross affiliate credit support. At December 31, 2009, the
Company had $88.9 million of commercial paper outstanding. At December 31, 2009, the Company also
had $1.4 million in notes payable outstanding related to other energy services contracts.

Financing Activities 

In 2009, the Company issued $140 million of senior notes and incurred obligations related to the
issuance of $130.4 million of pollution control revenue bonds. In addition, the Company issued to
Southern Company 1,350,000 shares of the Company s common stock, without par value, and realized
proceeds of $135 million. On January 25, 2010, the Company issued to Southern Company 500,000
shares of the Company s common stock, without par value, and realized proceeds of $50 million. The
proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company s short-term debt, to fund construction of
certain environmental projects, and for other general corporate purposes, including the Company s
continuous construction program.

The Company also entered into forward starting interest rate swaps during 2009 totaling $100
million to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes related to anticipated debt issuances. The
swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements, contractual
obligations, and storm-recovery, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a
program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Credit Rating Risk 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales,
fuel transportation and storage, emissions allowances, and energy price risk management. At
December 31, 2009, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at a BBB-
and/or Baa3 rating were approximately $130 million. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential
collateral requirements under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately
$547 million. Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in
the event that one or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating
change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company
guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the
Company s ability to access capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

On September 2, 2009, Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) affirmed the credit ratings of the
Company s senior unsecured notes and commercial paper of A2/P-1, respectively, and revised the
rating outlook to negative. On September 4, 2009, Fitch Ratings, Inc. affirmed the Company s
senior unsecured notes and commercial paper ratings of A/F1, respectively, and maintained a stable
rating outlook for the Company. On October 6, 2009, Standard and Poor s Rating Services, a
division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S P) affirmed the credit ratings of the Company s
senior unsecured notes and its short-term credit rating of A/A-1, respectively, and maintained its
stable rating outlook.

Market Price Risk 

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage
of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management
practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques including but not limited to market valuation, value at risk, stress
testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market and, to a lesser extent, into financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. The
Company has implemented a fuel-hedging program per the guidelines of the Florida PSC.

The weighted average interest rate on $319 million variable rate long-term debt at January 1, 2010
was 0.45%. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all variable
rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $3
million at January 1, 2010. See Note 1 to the financial statements under  Financial Instruments 
and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

(a) 
       
     Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered
into during the period, if any. 

The change in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the
year-ended December 31, 2009 was an increase of $17.5 million, substantially all of which is due to
natural gas positions. The change is attributable to both the volume of million British thermal
units (mmBtu) and prices of natural gas. At December 31, 2009, the Company had a net hedge volume
of 11.0 million mmBtu with a weighted average contract cost approximately $1.26 per mmBtu above
market prices, and 14.2 million mmBtu at December 31, 2008 with a weighted average contract cost
approximately $2.24 per mmBtu above market prices. Natural gas settlements are recovered through
the fuel cost recovery clause.

II-264 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge designation was
reflected in the financial statements as assets/ (liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges are related to the Company s
fuel hedging program, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and
assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the fuel
cost recovery clause. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related derivative contracts recognized in income
were not material for any year presented.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy
in which they fall at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

The Company uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using
prices which are actively quoted, and thus fall into Level 2. See Note 9 to the financial
statements for further discussion on fair value measurement.

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
derivative energy contracts. The Company only enters into agreements and material transactions
with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody s and S P or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under  Financial Instruments  and Note 10 to the financial
statements for additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $271.4 million in 2010,
$350.2 million in 2011, and $418.5 million in 2012. Environmental expenditures included in these
estimated amounts are $113.4 million in 2010, $194.8 million in 2011, and $194.2 million in 2012.
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; revised load growth estimates; storm impacts; changes in environmental
statutes and regulations; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Florida PSC approvals; changes in
legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope
and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs
related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the FERC and the Florida PSC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preference stock dividends, leases,
and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, 7, and 10 to the financial
statements for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Contractual Obligations 

(a) 
       
     All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to
retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market
conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of January 1,
2010, as reflected in the statements of capitalization. 

(b) 
       
     For additional information, see Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements. 

(c) 
       
     Preference stock does not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next five years only. 

(d) 
       
     The timing related to the realization of $1.7 million in unrecognized tax benefits and
interest payments in individual years beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated
due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 5 to the
financial statements for additional information. 

(e) 
       
     The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operations and
maintenance expenditures. Total other operations and maintenance expenses for 2009, 2008, and 2007
were $260 million, $277 million, and $270 million, respectively. 

(f) 
       
     The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent
current estimates of total expenditures. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase commitments
were outstanding in connection with the construction program. 

(g) 
       
     As part of the Company s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used
in flue gas desulfurization equipment. 

(h) 
       
     Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery.
Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at
December 31, 2009. 

(i) 
       
     The capacity-related costs associated with PPAs are recovered through the purchased power
capacity costs recovery clause. See Notes 3 and 7 to the financial statements for additional
information. 

(j) 
       
     Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices. 

(k) 
       
     The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. The
Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust fund is
2012 and such contribution could be significant. The projections of the amount vary significantly
depending on key variables, including future trust fund performance, and cannot be determined at
this time; therefore, no amounts related to the pension trust fund are included in the table. See
Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the pension and
postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit payments will be made
through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from the Company s corporate
assets.

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

General 

Gulf Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC
Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company,
Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
companies, Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power), Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), the
Company, and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power), are vertically integrated utilities
providing electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company provides retail service to
customers in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Power
constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at market-based
rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized
services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital
wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets
these services to the public and provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern
Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for Southern Company s investments in
leveraged leases. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company s nuclear
power plants.

The equity method is used for entities in which the Company has significant influence but does not
control. Certain prior years  data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
Florida Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions 

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
operations. Costs for these services amounted to $87 million, $86 million, and $73 million during
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to
be rendered at cost by system service companies.

The Company has agreements with Georgia Power and Mississippi Power under which the Company owns a
portion of Plant Scherer and Plant Daniel, respectively. Georgia Power operates Plant Scherer and
Mississippi Power operates Plant Daniel. The Company reimbursed Georgia Power $3.9 million, $8.1
million, and $5.1 million, and Mississippi Power $20.9 million, $22.8 million, and $23.1 million in
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, for its proportionate share of related expenses. See Note 4
and Note 7 under  Operating Leases  for additional information.

The Company entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA), with Southern Power for a total of
approximately 292 megawatts (MWs) annually from June 2009 through May 2014. The PPA was the result
of a competitive request for proposal process initiated by the Company in January 2006 to address
the anticipated need for additional capacity beginning in 2009. In May 2007, the Florida PSC
issued an order approving the PPA for the purpose of cost recovery through the Company s purchased
power capacity clause. The PPA with Southern Power was approved by the FERC in July 2007.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such services from other Southern Company
subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. There were no significant services
provided or received in 2009, 2008, or 2007.

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under  Fuel and Purchased Power
Commitments  for additional information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 

The Company is subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board in accounting
for the effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues
associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking
process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the
balance sheets at December 31  relate
to: 

Note: The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are as follows: 

(a) 
       
     Asset retirement and removal assets and liabilities are recovered, deferred charges related
to income tax assets are recovered, and deferred charges related to income tax liabilities
are amortized over the related property lives, which may range up to 65 years. Asset
retirement and removal liabilities will be settled and trued up following completion of the
related activities. 

(b) 
       
     Recovered over either the remaining life of the original issue or, if refinanced, over the
life of the new issue, which may range up to 40 years. 

(c) 
       
     Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year. 

(d) 
       
     Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the Florida PSC, generally within one year. 

(e) 
       
     Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the Florida PSC. The storm cost recovery
surcharge ended in June 2009. 

(f) 
       
     Fuel-hedging assets and liabilities are recognized over the life of the underlying hedged
purchase contracts, which generally do not exceed four years. Upon final settlement, costs
are recovered through the fuel cost recovery clause. 

(g) 
       
     Recovered through the environmental cost recovery clause when the remediation is performed. 

(h) 
       
     Recovered and amortized over the average remaining service period which may range up to
14 years. See Note 2 for additional information. 

(i) 
       
     Not earning a return as offset in rate base by a corresponding asset or liability. 

(j) 
       
     Recovered over the life of the PPA for periods up to 14 years. 

(k) 
       
     Deferred pursuant to Florida Statute while the Company continues to evaluate certain
potential new generation projects. 

In the event that a portion of the Company s operations is no longer subject to applicable
accounting rules for rate regulation, the Company would be required to write off or reclassify to
accumulated other comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to
determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if
impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in
rates.

Revenues 

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled revenues related to
retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Wholesale capacity revenues are
generally recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract period. The Company s
retail electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. The Company continuously
monitors the over or under recovered fuel cost balance in light of the inherent variability in fuel
costs. The Company is required to notify the Florida PSC if the projected fuel cost over or under
recovery is expected to exceed 10% of the projected fuel revenue applicable for the period and
indicate if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor is being requested. The Company has
similar retail cost recovery clauses for energy conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs,
and environmental compliance costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual
costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause
revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through
adjustments to the billing factors. Annually, the Company petitions for recovery of projected
costs including any true-up amounts from prior periods, and approved rates are implemented each
January. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters  for additional information.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10% or
more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of
revenues.

Fuel Costs 

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used.

Income and Other Taxes 

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with accounting standards related to the uncertainty in income taxes, the Company
recognizes tax positions that are  more likely than not  of being sustained upon examination by the
appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  for additional
information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The Company s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed.

II-277 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.1% in 2009, 3.4% in 2008, and 3.4% in 2007.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies are
approved by the Florida PSC. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal,
less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions, the
applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet accounts and a gain
or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are
retired when the related property unit is retired.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal 

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset s useful life.
The Company has received an order from the Florida PSC allowing the continued accrual of other
future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal obligation to
retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the
balance sheets as a regulatory liability.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company s combustion
turbines at its Pea Ridge facility, various landfill sites, a barge unloading dock, asbestos
removal, ash ponds, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers. The Company
also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution
facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and certain structures authorized by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been
recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle these obligations is unknown
and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize in the statements of
income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any differences between
costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards related to asset retirement and
environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset
or liability, as ordered by the Florida PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets.

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) 

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation. The equity component of AFUDC is not included in calculating taxable income. The
average annual AFUDC rate was 7.65%, 7.65%, and 7.48%, respectively, for the years 2009, 2008, and
2007. AFUDC, net of taxes, as a percentage of net income after dividends on preference stock was
26.64%, 12.62%, and 3.59%, respectively, for 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles 

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For

II-278 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Property Damage Reserve 

The Company accrues for the cost of repairing damages from major storms and other uninsured
property damages, including uninsured damages to transmission and distribution facilities,
generation facilities, and other property. The costs of such damage are charged to the reserve.
The Florida PSC-approved annual accrual to the property damage reserve is $3.5 million, with a
target level for the reserve between $25.1 million and $36.0 million. The Florida PSC also
authorized the Company to make additional accruals above the $3.5 million at the Company s
discretion. The Company accrued total expenses of $3.5 million in 2009, $3.5 million in 2008, and
$3.5 million in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the balance in the Company s property
damage reserve totaled approximately $24.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively, which is
included in deferred liabilities in the balance sheets.

When the property damage reserve is inadequate to cover the cost of major storms, the Florida PSC
can authorize a storm cost recovery surcharge to be applied to customer bills. Such a surcharge
was authorized in 2005 after Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and was extended by a 2006 Florida PSC order
approving a stipulation to address costs incurred as a result of Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina in
2005. According to the 2006 Florida PSC order, in the case of future storms, if the Company incurs
cumulative costs for storm-recovery activities in excess of $10 million during any calendar year,
the Company will be permitted to file a streamlined formal request for an interim surcharge. Any
interim surcharge would provide for the recovery, subject to refund, of up to 80% of the claimed
costs for storm-recovery activities. The Company would then petition the Florida PSC for full
recovery through a final or non-interim surcharge or other cost recovery mechanism.

Injuries and Damages Reserve 

The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. As
permitted by the Florida PSC, the Company accrues for the uninsured costs of injuries and damages
by charges to income amounting to $1.6 million annually. The Florida PSC has also given the
Company the flexibility to increase its annual accrual above $1.6 million to the extent the balance
in the reserve does not exceed $2 million and to defer expense recognition of liabilities greater
than the balance in the reserve. The cost of settling claims is charged to the reserve. The
injuries and damages reserve was $2.9 million and $2.5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. For 2009, $1.6 million and $1.3 million are included in current liabilities and
deferred credits and other liabilities in the balance sheets, respectively. For 2008, $2.5 million
is included in current liabilities in the balance sheets. Liabilities in excess of the reserve
balance of $0.1 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are included
in deferred credits and other liabilities in the balance sheets. Corresponding regulatory assets
of $0.1 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are included in
current assets in the balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies 

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory 

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emissions allowances.
Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered through fuel
cost recovery rates approved by the Florida PSC. Emissions allowances granted by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (included in  Other  or shown
separately as  Risk Management Activities ) and are measured at fair value. See Note 9 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Florida PSC-approved
hedging program. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
income (OCI) or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions
occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income.
Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a
net basis in the statements of income. See Note 10 for additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
has no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2009.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties 
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive Income 

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS 

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the defined benefit plan are expected for the
year ending December 31, 2010. The Company also provides a defined benefit pension plan for a
selected group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified
pension plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care
and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The
Company funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC. For the year ending December 31, 2010,
postretirement trust contributions are expected to total approximately $54,000.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2009 and 2008 was December 31 while the
measurement date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to accounting standards related to
defined postretirement benefit plans, the Company was required to change the measurement date for
its defined postretirement benefit plans from September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions
effective January 1, 2008 resulting in an increase in long-term liabilities of $1.4 million and an
increase in prepaid pension costs of approximately $0.6 million.

II-280

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Pension Plans 

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $275 million in 2009 and
$243 million in 2008. Changes during the plan year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15-month period
ended December 31, 2008 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were
as follows:

At December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $284 million and $15 million, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to the
qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). In
2009, in determining the optimal asset allocation for the pension fund, the Company performed an
extensive study based on projections of both assets and liabilities over a 10-year forward horizon.
The primary goal of the study was to maximize plan funded status. The Company s investment policy
covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real estate, and
private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily to gain efficient exposure to the
various asset classes and as hedging tools. The Company minimizes the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

The actual composition of the Company s pension plan assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, along
with the targeted mix of assets, is presented below:

The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Company s defined benefit plan is to be
broadly diversified across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after
consideration of various factors that affect the assets and liabilities of the pension plan
including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns, volatility, correlations of asset
classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and
liabilities. Because a significant portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in
nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment expectations for return and
risk. To manage the actual

II-281 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the Company employs a formal
rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment managers and service
providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent investment practices.

Detailed below is a description of the investment strategies for each major asset category
disclosed above:

Domestic equity.   This portion of the portfolio comprises a mix of large and small
capitalization stocks with generally an equal distribution of value and growth attributes
managed both actively and through passive index approaches. 

International equity.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed with a blend of
growth stocks and value stocks with both developed and emerging market exposure. 

Fixed income.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed through an allocation to
long-dated, investment grade corporate and government bonds. 

Special situations.   Though currently unfunded, this portion of the portfolio was established
both to execute opportunistic investment strategies with the objectives of diversifying and
enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as to invest in promising
new strategies of a longer-term nature. 

Real estate investments.   Assets in this portion of the portfolio are invested in traditional
private market, equity-oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate securities. 

Private equity.   This portion of the portfolio generally consists of investments in private
partnerships that invest in private or public securities typically through privately
negotiated and/or structured transactions. Leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed
debt are examples of investment strategies within this category. 

The fair values of pension plan assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are presented below. These
fair value measurements exclude cash, receivables related to investment income, pending investments
sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases.

* 
       
     Level 1 securities consist of actively traded stocks while Level 2 securities consist of
pooled funds. Management believes that the portfolio is well-diversified with no significant
concentrations of risk.

concentrations of risk. 

Changes in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 items in the pension plan assets valued
using significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as
follows:

The fair values presented above are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards
regarding fair value. For purposes of determining the fair value of the pension plan assets and the
appropriate level designation, management relies on information provided by the plan s trustee.
This information is reviewed and evaluated by management with changes made to the trustee
information as appropriate.

Securities for which the activity is observable in an active market or traded exchange are
categorized as Level 1. Fixed income securities classified as Level 2 are valued utilizing matrix
pricing, a common model utilizing observable inputs. Domestic and international equity securities
classified as Level 2 consist of pooled funds where the value is not quoted on an exchange but
where the value is determined using observable inputs from the market. Securities that are valued
using unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3 and include investments in real estate and
investments in limited partnerships. The Company invests (through the pension plan trustee)
directly in the limited partnerships which then invest in various types of funds or various private
entities within a fund. The fair value of the limited partnerships  investments is based on audited
annual capital accounts statements which are generally prepared on a fair value basis. The Company
also relies on the fact that, in most instances, the underlying assets held by the limited
partnerships

II-283 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

are reported at fair value. External investment managers typically send valuations to both the
custodian and to the Company within 90 days of quarter end. The custodian reports the most recent
value available and adjusts the value for cash flows since the statement date for each respective
fund.

Amounts recognized in the balance sheets related to the Company s pension plans consist of the
following:

Presented below are the amounts included in regulatory assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 related
to the defined benefit pension plans that had not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost
along with the estimated amortization of such amounts for 2010.

The changes in the balances of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to the defined
benefit pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15 months ended December 31,
2008 are presented in the following table:

II-284 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Components of net periodic pension cost were as follows:

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs
netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value
of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to
amortize changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the
changes immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate
the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2009, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

Other Postretirement Benefits 

Changes during the plan year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15-month period ended December 31,
2008 in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) and in the fair value of plan
assets were as follows:

Special situations.   Though currently unfunded, this portion of the portfolio was established
both to execute opportunistic investment strategies with the objectives of diversifying and
enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as to invest in promising
new strategies of a longer-term nature. 

Trust-owned life insurance.   Some of the Company s taxable trusts invest in these investments
in order to minimize the impact of taxes on the portfolio. 

Real estate investments.   Assets in this portion of the portfolio are invested in traditional
private market, equity-oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate securities. 

Private equity.   This portion of the portfolio generally consists of investments in private
partnerships that invest in private or public securities typically through privately
negotiated and/or structured transactions. Leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed
debt are examples of investment strategies within this category.

using unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3 and include investments in real estate and
investments in limited partnerships. The Company invests (through the pension plan trustee)
directly in the limited partnerships which then invest in various types of funds or various private
entities within a fund. The fair value of the limited partnerships  investments is based on
audited annual capital accounts statements which are generally prepared on a fair value basis. The
Company also relies on the fact that, in most instances, the underlying assets held by the limited
partnerships are reported at fair value. External investment managers typically send valuations to
both the custodian and to the Company within 90 days of quarter end. The custodian reports the
most recent value available and adjusts the value for cash flows since the statement date for each
respective fund.

Components of the other postretirement benefit plans  net periodic cost were as follows:

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) provides
a 28% prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company s expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 by approximately $1.3
million, $1.4 million, and $1.5 million, respectively.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service
and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the APBO for the postretirement plans.
Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy receipts expected as a result of the
Medicare Act as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions 

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2006 for the 2007 plan year using a discount rate of 6.00% and an annual
salary increase of 3.50%.

The Company estimates the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit
plan assets using a financial model to project the expected return on each current investment
portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each of seven different asset
classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust s
target asset allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on
four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset class (based in part on historical returns), each
trust s asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact of a periodic
rebalancing of each trust s portfolio.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 8.50% for 2010, decreasing gradually to 5.25% through the year 2016 and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%
would affect the APBO and the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2009 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan 

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees.
The Company provides an 85% matching contribution up to 6% of an employee s base salary. Total
matching contributions made to the plan for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $3.7 million, $3.5 million,
and $3.5 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

General Litigation Matters 

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment such as regulation of air emissions and
water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including
property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental
requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury and other claims for damages caused
by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief
and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have become more
frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot
be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.

Environmental Matters 

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions
of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. These
actions were filed concurrently with the issuance of notices of violation of the NSR provisions to
the Company with respect to the Company s Plant Crist. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the
original action, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR
violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia
Power, including one facility co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request penalties and
injunctive relief, including an order requiring installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The original action, now solely against Georgia Power, has been
administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome could require substantial
capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be
determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. Such
expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the

II-291 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other defendants  motions to
dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the plaintiffs  claim, and
remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the defendants, including Southern
Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject to potential appeal.
Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation  

The Company must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company received
authority from the Florida PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through the
environmental cost recovery clause. The Florida PSC reviews costs and adjusts rates up or down
annually.

The Company s environmental remediation liability includes estimated costs of environmental
remediation projects of approximately $65.2 million as of December 31, 2009. These estimated costs
relate to site closure criteria by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for
potential impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide applications at the Company s substations.
The schedule for completion of the remediation projects will be subject to FDEP approval. The
projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery through the Company s environmental
cost recovery clause; therefore, there is no impact to net income as a result of these liabilities.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the currently known
conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites, the
Company does not believe that additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material to
the Company s financial statements.

Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

FERC Matters 

Market-Based Rate Authority  

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company s generation market
power within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets was not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in
Southern Company s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended
in May 2006 could have been subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

On December 23, 2009, Southern Company and the FERC trial staff reached an agreement in principle
that would resolve the proceeding in its entirety. The agreement does not reflect any finding or
suggestion that the Company possesses or has exercised any market power. The agreement likewise
does not require the Company to make any refunds related to sales during the 15-month refund
period. Under the agreement, the Company will donate $0.1 million to nonprofit organizations in
the State of Florida for the purpose of offsetting the electricity bills of low-income retail
customers. The agreement is subject to review and approval by the FERC.

Intercompany Interchange Contract  

The Company s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies (including the Company), Southern
Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated,
(2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC s standards of conduct applicable to
utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company s code of
conduct defining Southern Power as a  system company  rather than a  marketing affiliate  is just
and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern
Power s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company s code of
conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement s terms.
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. In December 2008, the FERC division of audits issued
for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and related
matters. No comments were submitted challenging the audit report s findings of Southern
Company s compliance. The proceeding remains open pending a decision from the FERC regarding the
audit report.

Retail Regulatory Matters 

General  

The Company s rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory
oversight of the Florida PSC. The Company s rates are a combination of base rates and several
separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery
clauses address such items as fuel and purchased energy costs, purchased power capacity costs,
energy conservation, and demand side management programs, and the costs of compliance with
environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery
clauses are recovered through the Company s base rates.

On November 2, 2009, the Florida PSC approved the Company s annual rate requests for its purchased
power capacity, energy conservation, and environmental compliance cost recovery factors for 2010.
On December 1, 2009, the Florida PSC approved the Company s annual rate request for its 2010 fuel
cost recovery factor, which includes both fuel and purchased energy costs. The net effect of the
approved changes to the Company s cost recovery factors for 2010 is a 3.9% rate increase for
residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month. The billing factors for 2010 are
intended to allow the Company to recover projected 2010 costs as well as refund or collect the 2009
over or under recovered amounts in 2010. Cost recovery revenues, as recorded on the financial

II-293 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current
regulated rates. Accordingly, changing the billing factors has no significant effect on the
Company s revenues or net income, but does impact annual cash flow.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The Company petitions for fuel cost recovery rates to be approved by the Florida PSC on an annual
basis. The fuel cost recovery rates include the costs of fuel and purchased energy. The Company
continuously monitors the over or under recovered fuel cost balance in light of the inherent
variability in fuel costs. If the projected fuel cost over or under recovery exceeds 10% of the
projected fuel revenue applicable for the period, the Company is required to notify the Florida PSC
and indicate if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery is being requested. As of December 31,
2009 and 2008, the Company had an under recovered fuel balance of approximately $2.4 million and
$96.7 million, respectively, which is included in current assets in the balance sheets.

Purchased Power Capacity Recovery  

The Florida PSC allows the Company to recover its costs for capacity purchased from other power
producers under PPAs through a separate cost recovery component or factor in the Company s retail
energy rates. Like the other specific cost recovery factors included in the Company s retail
energy rates, the rates for purchased capacity are set annually on a calendar year basis. When the
Company enters into a new PPA, it is reviewed and approved by the Florida PSC for cost recovery
purposes. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had an over recovered purchased power
capacity balance of approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which is included in
other regulatory liabilities, current in the balance sheets.

Environmental Cost Recovery  

The Florida Legislature adopted legislation for an environmental cost recovery clause, which allows
an electric utility to petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance
costs that are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. Such
environmental costs include operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance expense,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital. This legislation also allows recovery of costs
incurred as a result of an agreement between the Company and the FDEP for the purpose of ensuring
compliance with ozone ambient air quality standards adopted by the EPA. In August 2007, the
Florida PSC voted to approve a stipulation among the Company, the Office of Public Counsel, and the
Florida Industrial Power Users Group regarding the Company s plan for complying with certain
federal and state regulations addressing air quality. The Company s environmental compliance plan
as filed in March 2007 contemplates implementation of specific projects identified in the plan from
2007 through 2018. The stipulation covers all elements of the current plan that are scheduled to
be implemented in the 2007 through 2011 timeframe. On April 1, 2009, the Company filed an update
to the plan which was approved by the Florida PSC on November 2, 2009. The Florida PSC
acknowledged that the costs associated with the Company s Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air
Visibility Rule compliance plan are eligible for recovery through the environmental cost recovery
clause. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the over recovered environmental balance was approximately
$11.7 million and $71 thousand, respectively, which is included in other regulatory liabilities,
current in the balance sheets.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS 

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, which together represent
capacity of 1,000 MWs. Plant Daniel is a generating plant located in Jackson County, Mississippi.
In accordance with the operating agreement, Mississippi Power acts as the Company s agent with
respect to the construction, operation, and maintenance of these units.

The Company and Georgia Power jointly own the 818 MWs capacity Plant Scherer Unit 3. Plant Scherer
is a generating plant located near Forsyth, Georgia. In accordance with the operating agreement,
Georgia Power acts as the Company s agent with respect to the construction, operation, and
maintenance of the unit.

The Company s pro rata share of expenses related to both plants is included in the corresponding
operating expense accounts in the statements of income and the Company is responsible for providing
its own financing.

Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, the Company s percentage ownership and its investment in these jointly owned
facilities were as follows:

(a) 
       
     Includes net plant acquisition adjustment of $3.1 million. 

5. INCOME TAXES 

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined State of Mississippi
and State of Georgia income tax returns. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation
agreement, each subsidiary s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis
and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax
return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the tax liability.

Current and Deferred Income Taxes 

Details of income tax provisions are as follows:

II-295 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and their respective tax bases, which give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities, are as follows:

At December 31, 2009, the tax-related regulatory assets to be recovered from customers was $39.0
million. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years
and to taxes applicable to capitalized allowance for funds used during construction. At
December 31, 2009, the tax-related regulatory liabilities to be credited to customers was
$11.4 million. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates
higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the
lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $1.6
million in 2009, $1.7 million in 2008, and $1.7 million in 2007. At December 31, 2009, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

Effective Tax Rate 

A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as
follows:

The decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate is primarily the result of an increase in nontaxable
allowance for equity funds used during construction.

II-296 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production
activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate
applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a
9% rate thereafter. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction.
However, Southern Company reached an agreement with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed
a closing agreement in December 2008. Therefore, in 2008, the Company reversed the unrecognized
tax benefit related to the calculation methodology and adjusted the deduction for all previous
years to conform to the agreement which resulted in a decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared
to the 2007 deduction. Certain aspects of the production activities deduction remain unresolved.
The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the application of
the new methodology had no material effect on the Company s financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

For 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $1.3 million, resulting in a
balance of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2009.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

The tax positions from current periods increase for 2009 relate primarily to the production
activities deduction tax position and other miscellaneous uncertain tax positions. The tax
positions increase from prior periods for 2009 relates primarily to the production activities deduction tax
position. See  Effective Tax Rate  above for additional information.

Impact on the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized, is as follows:

Accrued interest for unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

The Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The Company did not
accrue any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to the majority
of the Company s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next
12 months. The possible conclusion or settlement of state audits could impact the balances
significantly. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be
determined.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2006.

6. FINANCING 

Securities Due Within One Year 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had $140 million of senior notes due to mature within one year.
The date of maturity for these notes is June 2010.

Bank Term Loans 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had a $110 million bank loan outstanding, which matures in April
2011.

Senior Notes 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had a total of $727.5 million and $588.7 million of
senior notes outstanding, respectively. These senior notes are effectively subordinate to all
secured debt of the Company which totaled approximately $41 million at December 31, 2009.

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company has $288.0 million of outstanding pollution control revenue bonds and is
required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet principal and interest
requirements of such bonds. Proceeds from certain issuances are restricted until qualifying
expenditures are incurred.

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock 

The Company currently has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common
stock authorized. The Company s preferred stock and Class A preferred stock, without preference
between classes, rank senior to the Company s preference stock and common stock with respect to
payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. No shares of preferred stock or
Class A preferred stock were outstanding at December 31, 2009. The Company s preference stock
ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and voluntary or
involuntary dissolution. Certain series of the preference stock are subject to redemption at the
option of the Company on or after a specified date (typically five or 10 years after the date of
issuance) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation amount of the preference stock.
In addition, one series of the preference stock may be redeemed earlier at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the liquidation amount plus a make-whole premium based on the present value of the
liquidation amount and future dividends.

In January 2009, the Company issued to Southern Company 1,350,000 shares of the Company s common
stock, without par value, and realized proceeds of $135 million. On January 25, 2010, the Company
issued to Southern Company 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock, without par value, and
realized proceeds of $50 million. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company s
short-term debt and for other general corporate purposes, including the Company s continuous
construction program.

Dividend Restrictions 

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

Assets Subject to Lien 

The Company has granted a lien on its property at Plant Daniel in connection with the issuance of
two series of pollution control revenue bonds with an outstanding principal amount of $41 million.

There are no agreements or other arrangements among the affiliated companies under which the
assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of
Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had $220 million of lines of credit with banks, all of which
remained unused. These bank credit arrangements will expire in 2010 and $70 million contain
provisions allowing one-year term loans executable at expiration. Of the $220 million, $69 million
provides support for variable rate pollution control bonds, and $151 million provides liquidity
support for

II-298 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

the Company s commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes, including the
Company s continuous construction program. Commitment fees average less than   3  / 4  of 1% for the
Company.

Certain credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level of indebtedness to
capitalization to 65%, as defined in the arrangements. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants.

In addition, certain credit arrangements contain cross default provisions to other indebtedness
that would trigger an event of default if the Company defaulted on indebtedness over a specified
threshold. The cross default provisions are restricted only to indebtedness of the Company. The
Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants.

The Company borrows primarily through a commercial paper program that has the liquidity support of
committed bank credit arrangements. The Company may also borrow through various other arrangements
with banks. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $88.9 million of commercial paper outstanding.
At December 31, 2008, the Company had $89.9 million of commercial paper and $50 million of
short-term bank notes outstanding. During 2009, the peak amount outstanding for short-term debt
was $152.1 million and the average amount outstanding was $51.7 million. The peak amount
outstanding for short-term debt in 2008 was $141.2 million and the average amount outstanding was
$36.9 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt was 1.0% and 2.2% for 2009 and
2008, respectively.

7. COMMITMENTS 

Construction Program 

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, the cost of which is currently
estimated to total $271.4 million in 2010, $350.2 million in 2011, and $418.5 million in 2012. The
construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs
may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; revised load growth estimates; storm impacts; changes in environmental
statutes and regulations; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Florida PSC approvals; changes in
legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope
and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs
related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. At December 31, 2009, significant
purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the ongoing construction program.

Included in the amounts above are $113.4 million in 2010, $194.8 million in 2011, and
$194.2 million in 2012 for environmental expenditures. The Company does not have any significant
new generating capacity under construction. Construction of new transmission and distribution
facilities and other capital improvements, including those needed to meet environmental standards
for the Company s existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, are ongoing.

Long-Term Service Agreements 

The Company has a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of
securing maintenance support for a combined cycle generating facility. The LTSA provides that GE
will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which generally includes the cost of
all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the
covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in the LTSA.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles of the unit. Scheduled
payments to GE, which are subject to price escalation, are made at various intervals based on
actual operating hours of the unit. Total remaining payments to GE under the LTSA for facilities
owned are currently estimated at $59.2 million over the remaining life of the LTSA, which is
currently estimated to be up to 8 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation
provisions at the option of the Company.

Payments made under the LTSA prior to the performance of any planned inspections are recorded as
prepayments. These amounts are included in Current Assets and Deferred Charges and Other Assets in
the balance sheets for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Inspection costs are capitalized or charged to
expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Limestone Commitments 

As part of the Company s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from certain of its coal
plants, the Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone
to be used in flue gas desulfurization equipment. Limestone contracts are structured with tonnage
minimums and maximums in order to account for fluctuations in coal burn and sulfur content. The
Company has a minimum contractual obligation of 0.8 million tons equating to approximately $67.7
million, through 2019. Estimated expenditures (based on minimum contracted obligated dollars) over
the next five years are $6.0 million in 2010, $6.2 million in 2011, $6.3 million in 2012, $6.5
million in 2013, and $6.7 million in 2014. Limestone costs are recovered through the environmental
cost recovery clause.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments 

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil fuel. In most cases, these contracts
contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on
various indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent estimates
based on New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2009. Also, the Company has
entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of capacity, electricity, and
transmission. The energy-related costs associated with PPAs are recovered through the fuel cost
recovery clause. The capacity-related costs associated with PPAs are recovered through the
purchased power capacity cost recovery clause.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

* 
       
     Included above is $69.9 million in obligations with
affiliated companies. Certain PPAs are accounted for as
operating leases. 

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the Company s future needs.

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent
for the Company and all of the other Southern Company traditional operating companies and Southern
Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power may
be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to
the creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has
entered into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional operating
companies to ensure the Company will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses,
liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under
these agreements.

Operating Leases 

The Company has operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates. Total
operating lease expenses were $10.1 million, $5.0 million, and $4.7 million for 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively. Included in these lease expenses are rail car lease costs which are charged to
fuel inventory and are allocated to fuel expense as the fuel is used. These expenses are then
recovered through the Company s fuel cost recovery clause. The Company s share of the lease costs
charged to fuel inventories was $7.9 million in 2009, $4.0 million in 2008, and $4.4 million in
2007. The Company includes any step rents, escalations, and lease concessions in its computation
of minimum lease payments, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease
term.

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, estimated minimum rental commitments for noncancelable operating leases were
as follows:

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly entered into operating lease agreements for aluminum rail
cars for the transportation of coal to Plant Daniel. The Company has the option to purchase the
rail cars at the greater of lease termination value or fair market value or to renew the leases at
the end of each lease term. The Company and Mississippi Power also have separate lease agreements
for other rail cars that do not include purchase options.

The Company entered into operating lease agreements for barges and tow boats for the transport of
coal at Plant Crist. The Company has the option to renew the leases at the end of each lease term.
No barge lease costs were incurred for 2009, 2008, or 2007.

In addition to rail car leases, the Company has other operating leases for fuel handling equipment
at Plant Daniel. The Company s share of these leases was charged to fuel handling expense in the
amount of $0.3 million in 2009. The Company s annual lease payments for 2010 to 2014 will average
approximately $0.2 million.

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN 

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2009, there were 308 current and
former employees of the Company participating in the stock option plan, and there were 21 million
shares of Southern Company common stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices
of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant.
Options granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the
date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are
eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company s stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company used historical
exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that options granted
to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date
fair value of stock options granted:

II-301 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s activity in the stock option plan for 2009 is summarized below:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2009 was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2009 as
stated above. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6.4 years and 4.9 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $3.2 million and
$2.4 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $0.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 10 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $0.9 million, $0.8 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, with
the related tax benefit also recognized in income of $0.4 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million,
respectively.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and exercise of Southern Company stock
options to the Company s employees are recognized in the Company s financial statements with a
corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007 was $0.2 million, $1.3 million, and $3.0 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit
realized by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 totaled $0.1 million, $0.5 million, and $1.1 million,
respectively.

9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The fair value measurement is based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a
market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is
maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value
measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques used for fair value measurement.

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets
or liabilities. 

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that
is either directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions
of the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
If there is little available market data, then the Company s own assumptions are the
best available information. 

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

The fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis and the level of the fair value
hierarchy in which they fall at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

Energy-related derivatives and interest rate derivatives primarily consist of over-the-counter
contracts. See Note 10 for additional information. The cash equivalents and restricted cash
consist of securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. These financial instruments
and investments are valued primarily using the market approach.

As of December 31, 2009, the fair value measurements of investments calculated at net asset
value per share (or its equivalent), as well as the nature and risks of those investments, are
as follows:

The money market funds are short-term investments of excess funds in various money market mutual
funds, which are portfolios of short-term debt securities. The money market funds are regulated
by the SEC and typically receive the highest rating from credit rating agencies. Regulatory and
rating agency requirements for money market funds include minimum credit ratings and maximum
maturities for individual securities and a maximum weighted average portfolio maturity.
Redemptions are available on a same day basis, up to the full amount of the Company investment
in the money market funds.

As of December 31, 2009, other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal
fair value were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2).

10. DERIVATIVES 

The Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk. To
manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets its exposures, where
possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. The Company s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily
for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are
recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.

Energy-Related Derivatives 

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
manages fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of the Florida PSC, through the use
of financial derivative contracts.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in gas prices, the Company
may enter into fixed-price contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of
contracts are priced at market.

Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for in one of two methods:

Regulatory Hedges  - Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory
hedges relate primarily to the Company s fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are
initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included
in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through
the fuel cost recovery clause. 

Not Designated  - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as
incurred. 

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial
settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric industry.
When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or
loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the
actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

At December 31, 2009, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas
positions for the Company, together with the longest hedge date over which it is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest date
for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

* 
       
     mmBtu   million British thermal units 

Interest Rate Derivatives 

The Company also enters into interest rate derivatives, which include forward-starting interest
rate swaps, to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives related to existing
variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness.

For cash flow hedges, the fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into
earnings at the same time the hedged transactions affect earnings.

II-304 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges on forecasted debt as follows:

The estimated pre-tax losses that will be reclassified from OCI to interest expense for the next
12-month period ending December 31, 2010 are $0.9 million. The Company has deferred gains and
losses that are expected to be amortized into earnings through 2018.

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of energy-related derivatives and interest rate
derivatives was reflected in the balance sheets as follows:

All derivative instruments are measured at fair value. See Note 9 for additional information.

II-305 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Gulf Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the pre-tax effect of unrealized derivative gains (losses) arising
from energy-related derivative instruments designated as regulatory hedging instruments and
deferred on the balance sheets were as follows:

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the pre-tax effect of interest rate
derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments on the statements of income were as
follows:

There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the pre-tax effect of energy-related
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on the statements of income were immaterial.

Contingent Features 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating
changes of certain affiliated companies. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of derivative
liabilities with contingent features was $3.1 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no collateral posted with its derivative counterparties;
however, because of the joint and several liability features underlying these derivatives, the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features,
at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, is $33.3 million.

Currently, the Company has investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to debt and preference stock.

Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash.
The Company participated in certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one
or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below
investment grade.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

Mississippi Power Company 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Mississippi
Power Company (the  Company ) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder s
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-339 to II-380) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power Company at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

OVERVIEW 

Business Activities 

Mississippi Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s business of selling
electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment,
to maintain energy sales given the effects of the recession, and to effectively manage and secure
timely recovery of rising costs. The Company has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to
address cost recovery.

Appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with reasonable retail rates will
continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future. Hurricane Katrina, the worst natural
disaster in the Company s history, hit the Gulf Coast of Mississippi in August 2005, causing
substantial damage to the Company s service territory. All of the Company s 195,000 customers were
without service immediately after the storm. Through a coordinated effort with Southern Company,
as well as non-affiliated companies, the Company restored power to all who could receive it within
12 days. However, due to obstacles in the rebuilding process coupled with the recessionary
economy, as of December 31, 2009, the Company had over 8,800 fewer retail customers as compared to
pre-storm levels. See Note 1 to the financial statements under  Government Grants  and Note 3 to
the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Storm Damage Cost Recovery  for
additional information.

The Company s retail base rates are set under the Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP), a rate plan
approved by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC). PEP was designed with the objective
to reduce the impact of rate changes on the customer and provide incentives for the Company to keep
customer prices low and customer satisfaction and reliability high.

Key Performance Indicators 

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to customers, the
Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators are used to measure the
Company s performance for customers and employees.

In recognition that the Company s long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it
satisfies its customers  needs, the Company s retail base rate mechanism, PEP, includes performance
indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to the Company s allowed return. PEP
measures the Company s performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three
areas: average customer price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%);
service reliability, measured in outage minutes per customer (40%); and customer satisfaction,
measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). See Note 3 to the financial statements under
 Retail Regulatory Matters   Performance Evaluation Plan  for more information on PEP.

In addition to the PEP performance indicators, the Company focuses on other performance measures,
including broader measures of customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and
net income after dividends on preferred stock. The Company s financial success is directly tied to
the satisfaction of its customers. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate the
Company s results. Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of
plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation
needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by
total generation hours. The actual EFOR performance for 2009 was the best in the history of the
Company. Net income after dividends on preferred stock is the primary measure of the Company s
financial performance. Recognizing the critical role in the Company s success played by the
Company s employees, employee-related measures are a significant management focus. These measures
include safety and inclusion. The 2009 safety performance of the Company was the third best in the
history of the Company with an Occupational Safety and Health Administration Incidence Rate of
0.62. This achievement resulted in the Company being recognized as one of the top in safety
performance among all utilities in the Southeastern Electric Exchange. Inclusion initiatives
resulted in performance at target levels for the year.

The performance achieved in 2009 reflects the continued emphasis that management places on all of
these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by employees in achieving or exceeding
management s expectations.

Earnings 

The Company s net income after dividends on preferred stock was $85.0 million in 2009 compared to
$86.0 million in 2008. The 1.2% decrease in 2009 was primarily the result of decreases in
wholesale energy revenues and total other income and (expense) primarily resulting from an increase
in interest expense and decreases in contracting work performed for customers, as well as an
increase in income tax expense. These decreases in earnings were partially offset by an increase
in territorial base revenues primarily due to a wholesale base rate increase effective January 2009
and higher demand as well as a decrease in other non-fuel related expenses. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under  FERC Matters  for additional information.

Net income after dividends on preferred stock was $86.0 million in 2008 compared to $84.0 million
in 2007. The 2.4% increase in 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in territorial base
revenues due to a retail base rate increase effective January 2008 and an increase in wholesale
capacity revenues, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due
to the amortization of regulatory items, an increase in non-fuel related expenses, and an increase
in charitable contributions. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory
Matters  for additional information.

Net income after dividends on preferred stock was $84.0 million in 2007 compared to $82.0 million
in 2006. The 2.4% increase in 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in territorial base
revenues due to a retail base rate increase effective April 1, 2006, territorial sales growth, and
an increase in total other income and (expense) as a result of charitable contributions in 2006.
These factors were partially offset by an increase in non-fuel related expenses and an increase in
depreciation and amortization expenses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

A condensed statement of income follows:

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Operating Revenues 

Details of the Company s operating revenues in 2009 and the prior two years were as follows:

Total retail revenues for 2009 increased 0.7% when compared to 2008 primarily as a result of
slightly higher energy sales and fuel revenues. Total retail revenues for 2008 increased 8.0% when
compared to 2007 primarily as a result of a retail base rate increase effective in January 2008 and
higher fuel revenues. Total retail revenues for 2007 increased 12.4% when compared to 2006
primarily as a result of an increase in territorial sales growth, a retail base rate increase
effective in April 2006, and the Environmental Compliance Overview (ECO) Plan rate increase
effective in May 2007. See  Energy Sales  below for a discussion of changes in the volume of
energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (or decline) and weather.

Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel
costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel
revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the fuel component of purchased power, and do not
affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC
Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery  herein for
additional information. The fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased in 2009 when compared
to 2008 primarily as a result of higher recoverable fuel costs. Recoverable fuel costs include
fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel portion of wholesale revenues from energy
sold to customers outside the Company s service territory. The fuel and other cost recovery
revenues increased in 2008 when compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the increase in fuel and
purchased power expenses. The fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased in 2007 when
compared to 2006 as a result of higher fuel costs.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of available
energy compared to the cost of the Company and Southern Company system-owned generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company service territory, and availability of Southern Company system
generation. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $54.5 million, or
15.4%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 as a result of a $54.1 million decrease in energy revenues, of
which $27.6 million was associated with lower fuel prices and $26.4 million was associated with a
decrease in kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales, and a $0.5 million decrease in capacity revenues. Wholesale
revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $30.7 million, or 9.5%, in 2008 as compared to 2007
as a result of a $30.4 million increase in energy revenues, of which $40.4 million was associated
with higher fuel prices and a $0.3 million increase in capacity revenues, partially offset by a
$10.0 million decrease in KWH sales. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased
$54.3 million, or 20.2%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of a $51.5 million increase in
energy revenues, of which $32.0 million was associated with increased KWH sales and $19.5 million
was associated with higher fuel prices, and a $2.8 million increase in capacity revenues.

 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Included in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates are revenues from rural electric
cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi. The related
revenues increased 1.5%, 8.3%, and 12.6%, in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The 2009 increase
was driven by higher demand which was the result of some brief periods of weather extremes and a
base rate increase effective in January 2009. The customer demand experienced by these utilities
is determined by factors very similar to those experienced by the Company.

Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These
opportunity sales are made at market-based rates (MBRs) that generally provide a margin above the
Company s variable cost to produce the energy.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
from year to year depending on demand, availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in accordance with the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies decreased 55.9% in 2009 when compared to
2008, increased 118.6% in 2008 when compared to 2007, and decreased 39.5% in 2007 when compared to
2006. These energy sales do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
generally sold at marginal cost.

Other operating revenues in 2009 decreased $1.7 million, or 10.6%, from 2008 primarily due to a
$1.0 million decrease in transmission revenues. Other operating revenues in 2008 decreased $0.9
million, or 5.0%, from 2007 primarily due to a sale of oil inventory and a customer contract buyout
in 2007 totaling $0.9 million. Other operating revenues in 2007 increased $0.5 million, or 2.9%,
from 2006 primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in miscellaneous revenues from a sale of oil
inventory during the year, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in rent from electric
property.

Energy Sales  

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to
year. KWH sales for 2009 and percent change by year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Residential energy sales decreased 1.4% in
2009 compared to 2008 due to the recessionary economy and a declining number of customers.
Residential energy sales decreased 0.6% in 2008 compared to 2007 due to decreased customer usage
mainly due to the recessionary economy and unfavorable summer weather. Residential energy sales
increased 0.8% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to more favorable weather conditions, which
offset slow customer growth.

Commercial energy sales decreased 0.2% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the recessionary economy and
a net decline in commercial customers. Commercial energy sales decreased 0.7% in 2008 compared to
2007 due to unfavorable weather and slower than expected customer growth due to the economy.
Commercial energy sales increased 7.5% in 2007 compared to 2006 due to customer growth mainly in
the casino and hotel industries.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Industrial energy sales increased 3.4% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to increased production of
some of the Company s industrial customers and the impacts of Hurricane Gustav, which negatively
impacted industrial energy sales in 2008. Industrial energy sales decreased 3.0% in 2008 compared
to 2007 due to lower customer use from the recessionary economy. Industrial energy sales increased
4.2% in 2007 compared to 2006 due to continued recovery after Hurricane Katrina.

Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates decreased 7.3% and 3.3% and increased 12.1% in 2009, 2008,
and 2007, respectively. Included in wholesale sales from sales to non-affiliates are sales from
rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi.
Compared to the prior year, KWH sales to these customers remained at the same levels in 2009
despite the recessionary economy and unfavorable weather, decreased 0.9% in 2008 due to slowing
growth and unfavorable weather, and increased 4.3% in 2007 due to growth in the service territory.
KWH sales to non-territorial customers located outside the Company s service territory decreased
29.0% in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to fewer short-term opportunity sales related to
lower gas prices. KWH sales to non-territorial customers located outside the Company s service
territory decreased 9.6% in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to lower off-system sales. KWH
sales to non-territorial customers increased 41.0% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to
more off-system sales. Wholesale sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of
available energy compared to the cost of the Company and Southern Company system-owned generation,
demand for energy within the Southern Company service territory, and availability of Southern
Company system generation.

Wholesale energy sales to affiliates decreased 43.6% in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a
decrease in the Company s generation and an increase in territorial sales, resulting in less
capacity available to sell to affiliate companies. Wholesale energy sales to affiliates increased
44.9% in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to the availability of the Company s lower cost
generation resources for sale to affiliated companies. Wholesale energy sales to affiliates
decreased 38.9% in 2007 when compared to 2006 primarily due to a decrease in the Company s
generation and an increase in territorial sales, resulting in less capacity available to sell to
affiliate companies.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses  

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generating units. Additionally, the Company purchases a portion of its
electricity needs from the wholesale market. Details of the Company s electricity generated and
purchased were as follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $611.6 million in 2009, a decrease of $101.4 million, or
14.2%, below the prior year costs. This decrease was primarily due to a $69.9 million decrease in
the cost of fuel and purchased power and a $31.5 million decrease related to total KWHs generated
and purchased. Fuel and purchased power expenses were $713.1 million in 2008, an increase of
$122.9 million, or 20.8%, above the prior year costs. This increase was primarily due to a
$116.5 million increase in the cost of fuel and purchased power and a $6.4 million increase related
to total KWHs generated and purchased. Fuel and purchased power expenses were $590.1 million in
2007, an increase of $78.3 million, or 15.3%, above the prior year costs. This increase was
primarily due to a $63.8 million increase in the cost of fuel and purchased power and a
$14.5 million increase related to total KWHs generated and purchased.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Fuel expense decreased $66.8 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. Approximately $8.1 million
of the reduction in fuel expenses resulted primarily from lower gas prices and a $58.7 million
decrease in generation from Company-owned facilities. Fuel expense increased $92.2 million in 2008
as compared to 2007. Approximately $86.1 million in additional fuel expenses resulted from higher
coal, gas, and transportation prices and a $6.1 million increase in generation from Company-owned
facilities. Fuel expense increased $55.6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Approximately $56.8
million in additional fuel expenses resulted from higher coal, gas, transportation prices, and
emissions allowances, which were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in generation from
Company-owned facilities.

Purchased power expense decreased $34.6 million, or 27.4%, in 2009 when compared to 2008. The
decrease was primarily due to a $61.8 million decrease in the cost of purchased power, partially
offset by a $27.2 million increase in the amount of energy purchased which was due to lower cost
opportunity purchases. Purchased power expense increased $30.7 million, or 32.0%, in 2008 when
compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to a $30.4 million increase in the cost of
purchased power. Purchased power expense increased $22.6 million, or 30.9%, in 2007 when compared
to 2006. The increase was primarily due to a $7.0 million increase in the cost of purchased power
and a $15.6 million increase in the amount of energy purchased which was partially due to a
decrease in generation resulting from plant outages. Energy purchases vary from year to year
depending on demand and the availability and cost of the Company s generating resources. These
expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy purchases are generally
offset by energy revenues through the Company s fuel cost recovery clause.

Coal prices continued to be influenced by worldwide demand from developing countries, as well as
increased mining and fuel transportation costs. While coal prices reached unprecedented high
levels in 2008, the recessionary economy pushed prices downward in 2009. However, the lower prices
did not fully offset the higher priced coal already in inventory and under long-term contract.
Demand for natural gas in the United States also was affected by the recessionary economy leading
to significantly lower natural gas prices.

Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
Company s fuel cost recovery clause. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    PSC Matters   Fuel Cost
Recovery  and Note 1 to the financial statements under  Fuel Costs  for additional information.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses  

Total other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $13.3 million in 2009 as compared to 2008
primarily due to a decrease of $12.2 million in transmission, distribution, customer service, and
administrative and general expenses driven by overall reductions in spending in an effort to offset
the effects of the recessionary economy. Also contributing to the decrease was an $8.3 million
reduction in generation outage expenses in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by a $3.9
million increase in expenses for the combined cycle long-term service agreement due to a 36%
increase in operating hours as a result of lower gas prices. Also offsetting the decrease was $3.4
million resulting from the 2008 reclassification of generation construction screening expenses to a
regulatory asset upon the FERC s acceptance of the wholesale filing in October 2008.

Total other operations and maintenance expenses increased $4.8 million in 2008 as compared to 2007
primarily due to a $6.9 million increase in transmission and distribution expenses, an increase in
administrative expenses primarily resulting from the reclassification of System Restoration Rider
(SRR) revenues of $3.8 million to expense pursuant to an order from the Mississippi PSC dated
January 9, 2009, a $1.9 million increase in generation-related environmental expenses, and a $1.1
million increase in generation operations and outage-related expenses. These increases were
partially offset by a $9.3 million reclassification of generation construction screening expenses
to a regulatory asset upon the FERC s acceptance of the wholesale filing in October 2008.

Total other operations and maintenance expenses increased $18.6 million from 2006 to 2007. Other
operations expense increased $15.1 million, or 8.8%, in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result
of a $4.1 million increase in generation construction screening, a $3.3 million insurance recovery
for storm restoration expense recognized in 2006, a $2.1 million increase in employee benefits
primarily due to an increase in medical expense, a $2.0 million increase in outside and other
contract services, and a $2.0 million increase in scheduled production projects. Maintenance
expense increased $3.5 million, or 5.2%, in 2007 when compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a
$5.5 million increase in generation maintenance expense primarily due to outage work in 2007,
partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in transmission and distribution maintenance expenses
due primarily to the deferral of these expenses pursuant to the regulatory accounting order from
the Mississippi PSC.

 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $0.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily
due to a $3.1 million decrease in amortization of environmental costs related to the approved ECO
Plan, partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in depreciation expense resulting from an
increase in plant in service. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $10.7 million in
2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a $5.7 million increase in amortization related to a
regulatory liability recorded in 2003 that ended in December 2007 in connection with the
Mississippi PSC s accounting order on Plant Daniel capacity, a $2.9 million increase in
depreciation expense primarily due to an increase in plant in service, and a $2.4 million increase
for amortization of certain reliability-related maintenance costs deferred in 2007 in accordance
with a Mississippi PSC order. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $13.5 million in
2007 compared to 2006 due to a regulatory liability recorded in 2003 in connection with the
Mississippi PSC s accounting order on Plant Daniel capacity and an increase in amortization of
environmental costs related to the approved ECO Plan. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory
Matters   Performance Evaluation Plan  and  Environmental Compliance Overview Plan  for additional
information.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes  

Taxes other than income taxes decreased $1.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result
of a $0.8 million decrease in payroll taxes and a $0.2 million decrease in franchise taxes. Taxes
other than income taxes increased $4.8 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of a
$2.7 million increase in ad valorem taxes and a $1.3 million increase in municipal franchise taxes.
Taxes other than income taxes decreased $0.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a
result of a $2.0 million decrease in ad valorem taxes, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase
in municipal franchise taxes.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized  

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $5.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008
primarily due to a $5.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the issuance of new
long-term debt in November 2008 and March 2009, partially offset by the maturity of long-term debt
and lower interest rates in 2009. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $0.2
million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in borrowing and lower
interest rates on short-term indebtedness and a $0.7 million decrease related to the redemption of
outstanding trust preferred securities in 2007, partially offset by a $3.0 million increase in
interest expense associated with the issuance of new long-term debt in November 2008 and November
2007. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $0.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006
due to a $1.3 million decrease in long-term debt primarily related to the redemption of outstanding
trust preferred securities, partially offset by the issuance of new long-term debt in November 2007
and a $0.7 million increase in short-term debt borrowing net of amounts related to Hurricane
Katrina.

Other Income (Expense), Net  

Other income (expense), net decreased $1.7 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a $3.0
million decrease in customer projects and amounts collected from customers for construction of
substation projects which had a tax effect of $2.6 million, partially offset by higher charitable
contributions of $3.9 million in 2008. Other income (expense), net decreased $1.3 million in 2008
compared to 2007 primarily due to higher charitable contributions of $3.1 million, partially offset
by a $0.4 million increase in revenues from contracting work performed for customers, a $0.6
million decrease in other deductions, and a $0.6 million increase in allowance for equity funds
used during construction. Other income (expense), net increased $12.7 million in 2007 compared to
2006 primarily due to higher charitable contributions of $6.9 million in 2006 as compared to 2007,
a gain on a contract termination approved by the FERC in 2007 of $3.7 million, and an increase in
customer projects of $2.5 million.

Income Taxes  

Income taxes increased $1.9 million, or 3.9%, in 2009 primarily due to increased pre-tax income,
the 2008 amortization of a regulatory liability pursuant to a December 2007 regulatory accounting
order from the Mississippi PSC which occurred in 2008, and actualization of permanent differences
from previous year tax returns, partially offset by an increase in the federal production
activities deduction and an increase in a State of Mississippi manufacturing investment tax credit.
Income taxes decreased $3.4 million, or 6.7%, in 2008 primarily due to decreased pre-tax income,
the amortization of a regulatory liability pursuant to a December 2007 regulatory accounting order
from the Mississippi PSC, and a State of Mississippi manufacturing investment tax credit, partially
offset by a decrease in the federal production activities deduction. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under  Retail Regulatory Matters  for additional information. Income taxes increased
$3.7 million, or 7.8%, in 2007 primarily due to increased pre-tax income and lower federal and
state tax credits. See Note 5 to the financial statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Effects of Inflation 

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and
projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs
could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on the
Company s results of operations has not been substantial.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 

General 

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located in southeast Mississippi and to wholesale customers in
the southeast United States. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers
are set by the Mississippi PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings
are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale
electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are
regulated by the FERC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates   Electric Utility Regulation  herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under  FERC
Matters  and  Retail Regulatory Matters  for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s primary business of selling
electricity. These factors include the Company s ability to maintain a constructive regulatory
environment that continues to allow for the recovery of prudently incurred costs during a time of
increasing costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining energy
sales, which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new
energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price
of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the
Company s service area. Recessionary conditions have negatively impacted sales. The timing and
extent of the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

Environmental Matters 

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Environmental Matters  for additional
information.

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New
Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired
generating facilities. These actions were filed concurrently with the issuance of notices of
violations to the Company with respect to the Company s Plant Watson. After Alabama Power was
dismissed from the original action, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama
Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA
alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama
Power and Georgia Power, including one facility co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request
penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring installation of the best available
control technology at the affected units. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its
complaint to add the Company as a defendant based on the allegations in the notices of violation.
However, in March 2001, the court denied the motion based on lack of jurisdiction, and the EPA has
not re-filed. The original action, now solely against Georgia Power, has been administratively
closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

II-320 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in either of these cases
could require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at
this time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Environmental Statutes and Regulations  

General 

The Company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning   Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2009, the Company had invested approximately $224 million in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $22 million, $41 million, and $17 million for 2009,
2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to assure compliance
with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $11 million, $59 million, and
$128 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The Company s compliance strategy can be
affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations; the cost,
availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; and the Company s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY    Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations  herein.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and
health concerns could also significantly affect the Company. Although new or revised environmental
legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the Company s operations, the full impact of
any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality 

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2009, the Company had spent approximately $107 million
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are currently being
installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance with existing
regulations, and meet new requirements.

The EPA regulates ground level ozone through implementation of an eight-hour ozone air quality
standard. No area within the Company s service area is currently designated as nonattainment under
the eight-hour ozone standard. In March 2008, however, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a
more stringent eight-hour ozone standard, and on January 6, 2010, the EPA proposed further
reductions in the standard. The EPA is expected to finalize the revised standard in August 2010
and require state implementation plans for any nonattainment areas by December 2013. The revised
eight-hour ozone standard is expected to result in designation of new nonattainment areas within
the Company s service territory.

On December 8, 2009, the EPA also proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard
for SO 2 . The EPA is expected to finalize the revised SO 2  standard in June
2010.

Twenty-eight eastern states, including the States of Mississippi and Alabama, are subject to the
requirements of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The rule calls for additional reductions of
NO x  and/or SO 2  to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. In July
2008 and December 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued
decisions invalidating certain aspects of CAIR, but left CAIR compliance requirements in place
while the EPA develops a revised rule. The States of Mississippi and
Alabama have completed plans to implement CAIR, and emissions reductions are being accomplished by the installation of
emissions controls at the Company s coal-fired facilities and/or by the purchase of emissions
allowances. The
 EPA is expected to issue a proposed CAIR replacement rule in July 2010.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule was finalized in July 2005, with a goal of restoring natural
visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064.
The rule involves the application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources
built between 1962 and 1977, and any additional emissions reductions necessary for each designated
area to achieve reasonable progress toward the natural conditions goal by 2018 and for each
ten-year period thereafter. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to
determine that CAIR satisfies BART requirements for SO 2  and NO x , and no
additional controls beyond CAIR are anticipated to be necessary at any of the Company s facilities.
States have completed or are currently completing implementation plans for BART compliance and
other measures required to achieve the first phase of reasonable progress.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The EPA is currently developing a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule for coal
and oil-fired electric generating units, which will likely address numerous Hazardous Air
Pollutants, including mercury. In March 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), a
cap and trade program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. In
February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the CAMR. In
a separate proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the EPA entered into
a proposed consent decree that requires the EPA to issue a proposed MACT rule by March 16, 2011 and
a final rule by November 16, 2011.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standards and future revisions to CAIR, the SO 2 
standard, the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the MACT rule for electric generating units on the
Company cannot be determined at this time and will depend on the specific provisions of the final
rules, resolution of any legal challenges, and the development and implementation of rules at the
state level. However, these additional regulations could result in significant additional
compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO 2
 and NO x  emissions controls within the next several years to ensure continued
compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

Water Quality 

In July 2004, the EPA published final regulations under the Clean Water Act to reduce impingement
and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
water intake structures. The use of cost-benefit analysis in the rule was ultimately appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 1, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA could consider
costs in arriving at its standards and in providing variances from those standards for existing
intake structures. The EPA is now in the process of revising the regulations. While the U.S.
Supreme Court s decision may ultimately result in greater flexibility for demonstrating compliance
with the standards, the full scope of the regulations will depend on further rulemaking by the EPA
and the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

On December 28, 2009, the EPA announced its determination that revision of the current effluent
guidelines for steam electric power plants is warranted and proposed a plan to adopt such revisions
by 2013. New wastewater treatment requirements are expected and may result in the installation of
additional controls on certain Company facilities. The impact of revised guidelines will depend on
the studies conducted in connection with the rulemaking, as well as the specific requirements of
the final rule, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation 

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its respective financial
statements the costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs
were not material for any year presented. The Company could be liable for some or all required
cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under  Environmental Matters   Environmental Remediation  for additional
information.

Coal Combustion Byproducts 

The EPA is currently evaluating whether additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts is
merited under federal solid and hazardous waste laws. The EPA has collected information from the
electric utility industry on surface impoundment safety and conducted on-site inspections at three
Southern Company system facilities as part of its evaluation. The Company has a routine and robust
inspection program in place to ensure the integrity of its coal ash surface impoundments. The EPA
is expected to issue a proposal regarding additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts in
early 2010. The impact of these additional regulations on the Company will depend on the specific
provisions of the final rule and cannot be determined at this time. However, additional regulation
of coal combustion byproducts could have a significant impact on the Company s management,
beneficial use, and disposal of such byproducts and could result in significant additional
compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Global Climate Issues  

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions, renewable energy standards, and energy efficiency standards continue to be considered in
Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by
the current Administration. On June 26, 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009
(ACES), which would impose mandatory greenhouse gas restrictions through implementation of a cap
and trade program, a renewable energy standard, and other measures, was passed by the House of
Representatives. ACES would require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions on a national basis to
a level that is 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, and 83% below 2005
levels by 2050. In addition, ACES would provide for renewable energy standards of 6% by 2012 and
20% by 2020. Similar legislation is being considered by the Senate. The financial and operational
impact of such legislation, if enacted, will depend on a variety of factors. These factors include
the specific greenhouse gas emissions limits or renewable energy requirements, the timing of
implementation of these limits or requirements, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the
level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and
commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions,
the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any),
the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and cost recovery through regulated rates. There can be
no assurance that any legislation will be enacted or as to the ultimate form of any legislation.
Additional or alternative legislation may be adopted as well.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published
a final determination, which became effective on January 14, 2010, that certain greenhouse gas
emissions from new motor vehicles endanger public health and welfare due to climate change. On
September 28, 2009, the EPA published a proposed rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from new
motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has stated that once this rule is effective, it
will cause carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to become regulated pollutants under the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) preconstruction permit program and the Title V
operating permit program, which both apply to power plants. As a result, the construction of new
facilities or the major modification of existing facilities could trigger the requirement for a PSD
permit and the installation of the best available control technology for carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases. The EPA also published a proposed rule governing how these programs would be
applied to stationary sources, including power plants, on October 27, 2009. The EPA has stated
that it expects to finalize these proposed rules in March 2010. The ultimate outcome of the
endangerment finding and these proposed rules cannot be determined at this time and will depend on
additional regulatory action and any legal challenges.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. A nonbinding agreement was announced during the most recent round of
negotiations in December 2009 that included a pledge from both developed and developing countries
to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome and impact of the international negotiations
cannot be determined at this time.

Although the outcome of federal, state, or international initiatives cannot be determined at this
time, mandatory restrictions on the Company s greenhouse gas emissions or requirements relating to
renewable energy or energy efficiency on the federal or state level are likely to result in
significant additional compliance costs, including significant capital expenditures. These costs
could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions, and could result in the retirement
of a significant number of coal-fired generating units. See Item 1   BUSINESS    Rate Matters  
Integrated Resource Planning  for additional information. Also, additional compliance costs and
costs related to unit retirements could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Further, higher costs that are
recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could
negatively impact results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In 2008, the total carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel-fired electric generating units
owned by the Company were approximately 12 million metric tons. The preliminary estimate of carbon
dioxide emissions from these units in 2009 is approximately 10 million metric tons. The level of
carbon dioxide emissions from year to year will be dependent on the level of generation and mix of
fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability of generating units.

The Company is actively evaluating and developing electric generating technologies with lower
greenhouse gas emissions. These include proposed construction of an advanced integrated coal
gasification combined cycle (IGCC) unit with approximately 65% carbon capture in Kemper County,
Mississippi.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

FERC Matters 

In August 2008, the Company filed with the FERC a request for revised wholesale electric tariff and
rates. Prior to making this filing, the Company reached a settlement with all of its customers who
take service under the tariff. This settlement agreement was filed with the FERC as part of the
request. The settlement agreement provided for an increase in annual base wholesale revenues in
the amount of $5.8 million, effective January 1, 2009. In addition, the settlement agreement
allows the Company to increase its annual accrual for the wholesale portion of property damage to
$303,000 per year, to defer any property damage costs prudently incurred in excess of the wholesale
property damage reserve balance, and to defer the wholesale portion of the generation screening and
evaluation costs associated with the IGCC project to be located in Kemper County Mississippi. The
settlement agreement also provided that the Company will not seek a change in wholesale
 
full-requirements rates before November 1, 2010, except for changes associated with the fuel
adjustment clause and the energy cost management clause (ECM), changes associated with property
damages that exceed the amount in the wholesale property damage reserve, and changes associated
with costs and expenses associated with environmental requirements affecting fossil fuel generating
facilities. In October 2008, the Company received notice that the FERC had accepted the filing
effective November 1, 2008, and the revised monthly charges were applied beginning January 1, 2009.
As result of the order, the Company reclassified $9.3 million of previously expensed generation
screening and evaluation costs to a regulatory asset. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
 Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  for additional information.

PSC Matters 

Statewide Electric Generation Needs Review  

In April 2008, in accordance with the Mississippi Public Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued an
order to develop, publicize, and keep current an analysis of the five-year long-range needs for
expansion of facilities for the generation of electricity in the State of Mississippi. In its
order, the Mississippi PSC directed all affected utilities to submit evidence in support of their
forecasts and plans in accordance with the rules of the Mississippi PSC. On January 16, 2009, the
Company filed for a request for a Certificate of Public Convenience to construct generating
capacity. On August 4, 2009, the Mississippi PSC ordered a two-part hearing process to evaluate
the need for and the resources and cost of the new generating capacity separately. On November 9,
2009, the Mississippi PSC ordered that the need for new generating capacity existed. Hearings
related to the appropriate resource to meet that need as well as cost recovery of that resource
through application of the Baseload Act (described below) were held in February 2010. A decision
on the resources and cost is expected to be made by May 1, 2010. The ultimate outcome of this
matter cannot now be determined. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Integrated Coal
Gasification Combined Cycle  for additional information.

Mississippi Baseload Construction Legislation  

In the 2008 regular session of the Mississippi legislature, a bill was passed and signed by the
Governor in May 2008 to enhance the Mississippi PSC s authority to facilitate development and
construction of base load generation in the State of Mississippi (Baseload Act). The Baseload
Act authorizes, but does not require, the Mississippi PSC to adopt a cost recovery mechanism
that includes in retail base rates, prior to and during construction, all or a portion of the
prudently incurred pre-construction and construction costs incurred by a utility in constructing
a base load electric generating plant. Prior to the passage of the Baseload Act, such costs
would traditionally be recovered only after the plant was placed in service. The Baseload Act
also provides for periodic prudence reviews by the Mississippi PSC and prohibits the
cancellation of any such generating plant without the approval of the Mississippi PSC. In the
event of cancellation of the construction of the plant without approval of the Mississippi PSC,
the Baseload Act authorizes the Mississippi PSC to make a public interest determination as to
whether and to what extent the utility will be afforded rate recovery for costs incurred in
connection with such cancelled generating plant. The effect of this legislation on the Company
cannot now be determined.

Performance Evaluation Plan  

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company s request to reclassify 266 megawatts (MWs)
of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 capacity to jurisdictional cost of service effective January 1, 2004,
and authorized the Company to include the related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate
base, cost of service, and revenue requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery.
In the May 2004 order establishing the Company s forward-looking PEP, the Mississippi PSC ordered
that the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and the Company review the operations of the PEP in
2007. By mutual agreement, this review was deferred until 2008 and continued into 2009. On March
2, 2009, concurrent with this review, the annual PEP evaluation filing for 2009 was suspended. On
August 3, 2009, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and the Company filed a joint report with
the Mississippi PSC proposing

II-325 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

several changes to the PEP. On November 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC approved the revised
PEP, which resulted in a lower performance incentive under the PEP and therefore smaller and/or
less frequent rate changes in the future. On November 16, 2009, the Company resumed annual
evaluations and filed its annual PEP filing for 2010 under the revised PEP, which resulted in a
lower allowed return on investment but no rate change.

In April 2007, the Mississippi PSC issued an order allowing the Company to defer certain
reliability related maintenance costs beginning January 1, 2007 and recover them evenly over a
four-year period beginning January 1, 2008. These costs related to maintenance that was needed as
follow-up to emergency repairs that were made subsequent to Hurricane Katrina. At December 31,
2007, the Company had incurred and deferred the retail portion of $9.5 million of such costs. At
December 31, 2009, the Company had a balance of the deferred retail portion of $4.7 million with
$2.3 million included in current assets as other regulatory assets and $2.4 million included in
long-term other regulatory assets. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Retail Regulatory
Matters   Performance Evaluation Plan  for more information on PEP.

System Restoration Rider  

In September 2006, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC a request to implement a SRR to
increase the Company s cap on the property damage reserve and to authorize the calculation of an
annual property damage accrual based on a formula. The purpose of the SRR is to provide for
recovery of costs associated with property damage (including certain property insurance and the
costs of self insurance) and to facilitate the Mississippi PSC s review of these costs. In
November 2007, the Company along with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff agreed and stipulated
to a revised SRR calculation method that would no longer require the Mississippi PSC to set a cap
on the property damage reserve or to authorize the calculation of an annual property damage
accrual. Under the revised SRR calculation method, the Mississippi PSC would periodically agree on
SRR revenue levels that would be developed based on historical data, expected exposure, type and
amount of insurance coverage excluding insurance costs, and other relevant information.

On January 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order accepting the stipulation and the revised
SRR calculation method. The applicable SRR rate level will be adjusted every three years, unless a
significant change in circumstances occurs such that the Company and the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff or the Mississippi PSC deems that a more frequent change would be appropriate. The
Company will submit annual filings setting forth SRR-related revenues, expenses, and investment for
the projected filing period, as well as the true-up for the prior period. As a result, the
December 2008 retail regulatory liability of $6.8 million was reclassified to the property damage
reserve. On February 2, 2009, the Company submitted its 2009 SRR rate filing with the Mississippi
PSC, which proposed that the 2009 SRR rate level remain at zero and the Company be allowed to
accrue approximately $4.0 million to the property damage reserve in 2009. On September 10, 2009,
the Mississippi PSC issued an order requiring Mississippi Power to develop SRR factors designed to
reduce SRR revenue by approximately $1.5 million from November 2009 to March 2010 under the new
rate. On January 29, 2010, the Company submitted its 2010 SRR rate filing with the Mississippi
PSC, which proposed that the Company be allowed to accrue approximately $3.0 million to the
property damage reserve in 2010. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan  

On February 12, 2010, the Company submitted its 2010 ECO Plan notice which proposes an increase in
annual revenues for the Company of approximately $3.9 million. In its 2010 ECO filing, the Company
is proposing to change the true-up provision of the ECO rate schedule to consider actual revenues
collected in addition to actual costs. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.
On February 3, 2009, the Company submitted its 2009 ECO Plan notice which proposed an increase in
annual revenues for the Company of approximately $1.5 million. On June 19, 2009, the Mississippi
PSC approved the ECO Plan with the new rates effective in June 2009.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The Company establishes, annually, a retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the
Mississippi PSC. The Company is required to file for an adjustment to the retail fuel cost
recovery factor annually; such filing occurred in November 2009. The Mississippi PSC approved the
retail fuel cost recovery factor on December 15, 2009, with the new rates effective in January
2010. The retail fuel cost recovery factor will result in an annual decrease in an amount equal to
11.3% of total 2009 retail revenue. At December 31, 2009, the amount of over recovered retail fuel
costs included in the balance sheets was $29.4 million compared to $36.0 million under recovered at
December 31, 2008. The Company also has a wholesale Municipal and Rural Associations (MRA) and a
Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factor. Effective January 1, 2010, the wholesale MRA fuel
rate decreased, resulting in an

II-326 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

annual decrease in an amount equal to 20.9% of total 2009 MRA revenue. Effective February 1,
2010, the wholesale MB fuel rate decreased, resulting in an annual decrease in an amount equal to
16.9% of total 2009 MB revenue. At December 31, 2009, the amount of over recovered wholesale MRA
and MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets was $16.8 million and $2.4 million compared to
$15.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively, under recovered at December 31, 2008. The Company s
operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed
in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, this decrease to the
billing factor will have no significant effect on the Company s revenues or net income, but will
decrease annual cash flow.

In October 2008, the Mississippi PSC opened a docket to investigate and review interest and
carrying charges under the fuel adjustment clause for utilities within the State of Mississippi
including the Company. On March 4, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order to apply the prime
rate in calculating the carrying costs on the retail over or under recovery balances related to
fuel cost recovery. On May 20, 2009, the Company filed the carrying cost calculation methodology
as part of its compliance filing.

In August 2009, the Mississippi PSC engaged an independent professional audit firm to conduct an
audit of the Company s fuel-related expenditures included in the fuel adjustment clause and the ECM
clause of 2008 and 2009. The audit was completed in December 2009. There were no audit findings
identified in the audit.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery  

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States and caused significant
damage within the Company s service area. The estimated total storm restoration costs relating to
Hurricane Katrina through December 31, 2007 were $302.4 million, which was net of expected
insurance proceeds of approximately $77 million, without offset for the property damage reserve of
$3.0 million. Such costs were affirmed by the Mississippi PSC in June 2006, and the Company was
ordered to establish a regulatory asset for the retail portion. The Mississippi PSC issued an
order directing the Company to file an application with the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA)
for a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). In October 2006, the Company received from the MDA
a CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million, which was allocated to both the retail and wholesale
jurisdictions. In the same month, the Mississippi PSC issued a financing order that authorized the
issuance of system restoration bonds for the remaining $25.2 million of the retail portion of storm
recovery costs not covered by the CDBG. These funds were received in June 2007. The Company
affirmed the $302.4 million total storm costs incurred as of December 31, 2007. On March 2, 2009,
the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC its final accounting of the restoration cost relating to
Hurricane Katrina and the storm operations center. The final net retail receivable of
approximately $3.2 million is expected to be recovered in 2010.

Legislation 

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives, which could have a significant impact on the future cash flow
and net income of the Company. The Company s cash flow reduction to 2009 tax payments as a result
of the bonus depreciation provisions of the ARRA was approximately $14 million. On December 8,
2009, President Obama announced proposals to accelerate job growth that include an extension of the
bonus depreciation provision for the ARRA for 2010, which could have a significant impact on the
future cash flow and net income of the Company.

On October 27, 2009, Southern Company and its subsidiaries received notice that an award of $165
million had been granted, of which $25 million related to the Company, under the ARRA grant
application for transmission and distribution automation and modernization projects pending final
negotiations. The Company continues to assess the other financial implications of the ARRA.

The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have passed separate bills related to
healthcare reform. Both bills include a provision that would make Medicare Part D subsidy
reimbursements taxable. If enacted into law, this provision could have a significant negative
impact on the Company s net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under  Other
Postretirement Benefits  for additional information.

The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Income Tax Matters 

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production activities net
income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to
the years

II-327 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter.
See Note 5 to the financial statements under  Effective Tax Rate  for additional information.

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle 

On January 16, 2009, the Company filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with
the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. The plant would utilize an IGCC technology with an output capacity of 582
MWs. The Kemper IGCC will use locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a
proposed mine adjacent to the plant as fuel. This certificate, if approved by the Mississippi PSC,
would authorize the Company to acquire, construct, and operate the Kemper IGCC and related
facilities. The Kemper IGCC, subject to federal and state reviews and certain regulatory
approvals, is expected to begin commercial operation in May 2014. As part of its filing, the
Company has requested certain rate recovery treatment in accordance with the Baseload Act.

The Company filed an application in June 2006 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for certain
tax credits available to projects using clean coal technologies under the Energy Policy Act of
2005. The DOE subsequently certified the Kemper IGCC, and in November 2006 the IRS allocated
Internal Revenue Code Section 48A tax credits of $133 million to the Company. On May 11, 2009, the
Company received notification from the IRS formally certifying these tax credits. The utilization
of these credits is dependent upon meeting the certification requirements for the Kemper IGCC,
including an in-service date no later than May 2014. The Company has secured all environmental
reviews and permits necessary to commence construction of the Kemper IGCC and has entered into a
binding contract for the steam turbine generator, completing two milestone requirements for the
Section 48A credits.

In February 2008, the Company also requested that the DOE transfer the remaining funds previously
granted to a cancelled Southern Company project that would have been located in Orlando, Florida.
In December 2008, an agreement was reached to assign the remaining funds to the Kemper IGCC. The
estimated construction cost of the Kemper IGCC is approximately $2.4 billion, which is net of $245
million related to funding to be received from the DOE related to project construction. The
remaining DOE funding of $25 million is projected to be used for demonstration over the first few
years of operation.

On April 6, 2009, the Governor of the State of Mississippi signed into law a bill that will provide
an ad valorem tax exemption for a portion of the assessed value of all property utilized in certain
electric generating facilities with integrated gasification process facilities. This tax
exemption, which may not exceed 50% of the total value of the project, is for projects with a
capital investment from private sources of $1 billion or more. The Company expects the Kemper
IGCC, including the gasification portion, to be a qualifying project under the law.

Beginning in December 2006, the Mississippi PSC has approved the Company s requested accounting
treatment to defer the costs associated with the Company s generation resource planning,
evaluation, and screening activities as a regulatory asset. In December 2008, the Company
requested an amendment to its original order that would allow these costs to continue to be charged
to and remain in a regulatory asset until January 1, 2010. On April 6, 2009, the Company received
an accounting order from the Mississippi PSC directing the Company to continue to charge all
generation resource planning, evaluation, and screening costs to regulatory assets including those
costs associated with activities to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity and
costs necessary and prudent to preserve the availability, economic viability, and/or required
schedule of the Kemper IGCC generation resource planning, evaluation, and screening activities
until the Mississippi PSC makes findings and determination as to the recovery of the Company s
prudent expenditures. The Mississippi PSC s determination of prudence for the Company s
pre-construction costs is scheduled to occur by May 2010. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
spent a total of $73.5 million associated with the Company s generation resource planning,
evaluation, and screening activities, including regulatory filing costs. Costs incurred for the
year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $31.2 million as compared to $24.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2008. Of the total $73.5 million, $68.5 million was deferred in other regulatory
assets, $4.0 million was related to land purchases capitalized, and $1.0 million was expensed.

On June 5, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order initiating an evaluation of the Kemper IGCC
and establishing a two-phase procedural schedule. On August 4, 2009, the Mississippi PSC ordered a
two-part hearing process to evaluate the need for and the resources and cost of the new generating
capacity separately. On November 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order that found the
Company has a demonstrated need for additional capacity of approximately 304 MWs to 1,276 MWs based
on an analysis of expected load forecasts, costs, and anticipated retirements. Hearings related to
the appropriate resource to meet that need as well as cost recovery of that resource through
application of the Baseload Act were held in February 2010. A decision on the resources and cost
recovery is expected to be made by May 1, 2010.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

On September 15, 2009, South Mississippi Electric Power Association (SMEPA) signed a
non-binding letter of intent to explore the acquisition of an interest in the Kemper IGCC. The
Company and SMEPA are evaluating a combination of a joint ownership arrangement and a power
purchase agreement which would provide SMEPA with up to 20% of the capacity and associated energy
output from the Kemper IGCC.

The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Other Matters 

In February 2008, the Company received notice of termination from SMEPA of an approximately 100 MW
territorial wholesale market-based contract effective March 31, 2011 which will result in a
decrease in annual revenues of approximately $12 million. In December 2008, the Company entered
into a 10-year power supply agreement with SMEPA for approximately 152 MWs. This contract is
effective April 1, 2011, upon approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture s Rural Utilities
Service. This contract is expected to increase the Company s annual territorial wholesale base
revenues by approximately $16.1 million. On June 3, 2009, Mississippi Power s 10-year
power supply agreement with SMEPA for approximately 152 MWs effective April 1, 2011 was approved by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture s Rural Utilities Service.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could
affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company s business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation
of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various
types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased
generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury, and other claims for
damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law nuisance claims for
injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the
Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.
See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company s
Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation  

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Mississippi PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies accounting standards which require the
financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process,
the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they
would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of
expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery
through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on the
Company s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company s results of operations than
they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities
have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and
liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could
materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact
the Company s financial statements.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Contingent Obligations  

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and
reasonably estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external
events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could
materially affect the Company s financial statements. These events or conditions include the
following:

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, coal combustion byproducts, including coal
ash, control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
matters. 

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in IRS or state revenue department
interpretations of existing regulations. 

Identification of additional sites that require environmental remediation or the filing
of other complaints in which the Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible
party. 

Identification and evaluation of new or other potential lawsuits or complaints in which
the Company may be named as a defendant. 

Resolution or progression of new or existing matters through the legislative process, the
court systems, the IRS, state revenue departments, the FERC, or the EPA. 

Unbilled Revenues  

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation
patterns, and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be
unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled
revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company s
results of operations.

Plant Daniel Operating Lease  

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under  Operating Leases   Plant Daniel Combined
Cycle Generating Units,  the Company leases a 1,064-MW natural gas combined cycle facility at Plant
Daniel (Facility) from Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper). For both accounting and rate recovery
purposes, this transaction is treated as an operating lease, which means that the related
obligations under this agreement are not reflected in the balance sheets. See FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND LIQUIDITY    Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements  herein for further information. The
operating lease determination was based on assumptions and estimates related to the following:

Fair market value of the Facility at lease inception; 

The Company s incremental borrowing rate; 

Timing of debt payments and the related amortization of the initial acquisition cost during the
initial lease term; 

Residual value of the Facility at the end of the lease term; 

Estimated economic life of the Facility; and 

Juniper s status as a voting interest entity. 

II-330 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The determination of operating lease treatment was made at the inception of the lease
agreement and is not subject to change unless subsequent changes are made to the agreement.
However, the Company is also required to monitor Juniper s ongoing status as a voting interest
entity. Changes in that status could require the Company to consolidate the Facility s assets and
the related debt and to record interest and depreciation expense of approximately $37 million
annually, rather than annual lease expense of approximately $26 million.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

The Company s calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a
number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates,
expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and
other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest
and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan
assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ
from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore,
generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the
Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefits costs
and obligations.

Key elements in determining the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit expense in
accordance with GAAP are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to
measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The
expected long-term return on postretirement benefit plan assets is based on the Company s
investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that
considers external actuarial advice. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by
applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to the Company s target
asset allocation. The Company discounts the future cash flows related to its postretirement
benefit plans using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of
market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to
expected benefit payments.

A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption would result in a $0.7 million or less change
in the total benefit expense and a $13 million or less change in projected obligations.

New Accounting Standards 

Variable Interest Entities  

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance of the consolidation of
variable interest entities, which replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for
determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an
approach that is primarily qualitative, requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requires additional disclosures about an
enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities. The Company adopted this new guidance
effective January 1, 2010, with no material impact on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

Overview 

The Company s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2009. Throughout the turmoil in
the financial markets, the Company has maintained adequate access to capital without drawing on any
of its committed bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial paper programs and
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The Company intends to continue to monitor its
access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet
future capital and liquidity needs. Market rates for committed credit have increased, and the
Company has been and expects to continue to be subject to higher costs as its existing facilities
are replaced or renewed. Total committed credit fees for the Company average less than   1  / 4  of 1% per
year. The ultimate impact on future financing costs as a result of financial turmoil cannot be
determined at this time. See  Sources of Capital  and  Financing Activities  herein for additional
information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s investments in pension trust funds remained stable as of December 31, 2009. The
Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust fund is
2012 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections of the amount vary
significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related to federal legislation passed
during 2008 as well as other key variables including future trust fund performance and cannot be
determined at this time.

Net cash provided from operating activities in 2009 increased from 2008 by $76.2 million. The
increase in net cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash
related to higher fuel rates effective in March 2009 and a decrease in deferred income taxes. Net
cash provided from operating activities in 2008 decreased from 2007 by $112.2 million. The
decrease in net cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to the receipt of grant
proceeds of $74.3 million in June 2007 and a decrease in operating activities related to
receivables in 2008 in the amount of $49.5 million. The decrease in receivables is primarily due
to the change in under recovered regulatory clause revenues of $24.7 million and a $24.1 million
change in affiliate receivables. Also impacting operating activities were decreases related to
fossil fuel stock of $33.3 million primarily due to increases in coal and coal in-transit of $22.0
million and $15.6 million, respectively. These were offset by an increase in deferred income taxes
and investment tax credits of $61.4 million. Net cash provided from operating activities increased
in 2007 compared to 2006 by $11.7 million primarily due to the Company s receipt of $74.3 million
in bond proceeds during 2007 related to Hurricane Katrina recovery, of which $60 million was used
to fund the property damage reserve and $14.3 million was used to recover retail operations and
maintenance storm restoration cost.

Net cash used for investing activities totaled $119.4 million for 2009 compared to $155.8 million
for 2008. The $36.4 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in property additions. The
$55.3 million increase in net cash used for investing activities in 2008 was primarily due to a
$12.1 million increase in construction payables and a $27.6 million increase due to the capital
portion of Hurricane Katrina grant proceeds received in 2007. The change in net cash used for
investing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 of $107.0 million was primarily due to a $117.8
million reduction in the sources of funds related to Hurricane Katrina capital-related grant
proceeds received in 2006 and bond proceeds.

Net cash used for financing activities totaled $8.6 million in 2009 compared to $78.9 million that
was provided from financing activities in 2008. The $87.5 million decrease was primarily due to a
$42.6 million decrease in notes payable and a $40 million decrease in long-term debt as a result of
a March 2009 senior note redemption, when compared to the corresponding period in 2008. Net cash
provided from financing activities totaled $78.9 million in 2008 compared to $105.5 million that
was used in financing activities for the corresponding period in 2007. The $184.5 million increase
in net cash provided from financing activities was primarily due to the $80 million long-term bank
loan issued to the Company in March 2008, the $50 million senior notes issued in November 2008, and
the $36 million redemption of the long-term debt to an affiliated trust in the first nine months of
2007. Notes payable increased by $57.8 million primarily due to additional borrowings from
commercial paper. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $105.5 million in 2007 compared
to $211.5 million in 2006. This decrease in net cash used for financing activities is primarily
due to a decrease in the use of funds related to notes payable of $109.3 million.

Significant changes in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 include an
increase in cash of $42.6 million. Under recovered regulatory clause revenues decreased by $55.0
million primarily due to lower fuel costs and the implementation of higher fuel rates in 2009.
Fossil fuel inventory increased $41.7 million primarily due to increases in coal inventory and
emissions allowances of $30.1 million and $11.6 million, respectively. Prepaid income taxes
increased by $31.2 million and total property, plant, and equipment increased by $32.4 million.
Other regulatory assets, deferred increased by $37.4 million primarily due to the increase in
spending related to the Kemper IGCC. Securities due within one year decreased $39.9 million
primarily due to senior notes maturing during the first quarter 2009. Notes payable decreased by
$26.3 million primarily due to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings. Over recovered
regulatory clause liabilities increased by $48.6 million primarily due to lower fuel costs and the
implementation of higher fuel rates in 2009. Long-term debt increased by $123.0 million primarily
due to the issuance of senior notes in the first quarter 2009. Employee benefit obligations
increased $19.6 million primarily due to the decline in the market value of pension assets. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under  Pension Plans  for additional information.

The Company s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, excluding long-term debt due within
one year, decreased from 61.2% in 2008 to 55.6% at December 31, 2009. The Company has received
investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with respect to debt and preferred
stock. See SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA for additional information regarding the
Company s security ratings. See  Credit Rating Risk  herein for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Sources of Capital 

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
such as operating cash flows, security issuances, term loans, short-term borrowings, and capital
contributions from Southern Company. See  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations  herein
and Note 3 to the financial statements under  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  for
additional information. The amount, type, and timing of any financings, if needed, will depend
upon regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions, and other factors.

The issuance of securities by the Company is subject to regulatory approval by the FERC.
Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files registration
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the FERC, as well as the amounts
registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to
ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The Southern
Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
are not commingled with funds of any other company.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various sources of liquidity. At
December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $65 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$156 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. See Note 6 to the financial statements
under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of the Company and the other
traditional operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are
loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the
benefit of any other operating company. The obligations of each company under these arrangements
are several; there is no cross affiliate credit support. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no
commercial paper outstanding.

Financing Activities 

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company issued senior notes totaling $125 million. Proceeds
were used to repay at maturity the Company s $40 million aggregate principal amount of Series F
Floating Rate Senior Notes due March 9, 2009 and to repay a portion of the Company s short-term
indebtedness.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual
obligations, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

In 2001, the Company began an initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a combined cycle
generating facility built at Plant Daniel. In June 2003, the Company entered into a restructured
lease agreement for the Facility with Juniper, as discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements
under  Operating Leases   Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units.  Juniper has also entered
into leases with other parties unrelated to the Company. The assets leased by the Company comprise
less than 50% of Juniper s assets. The Company does not consolidate the leased assets and related
liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. Accordingly, the lease
is not reflected in the balance sheets.

The initial lease term ends in 2011, and the lease includes a renewal and a purchase option based
on the cost of the Facility at the inception of the lease, which was approximately $370 million.
The Company is required to amortize approximately 4% of the initial acquisition cost over the
initial lease term. In April 2010, 18 months prior to the end of the initial lease, the Company
must notify Juniper if the lease will be terminated. The Company may elect to renew the lease for
10 years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for the Company to amortize an additional
17% of the initial completion cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease, at the
Company s option, it may either exercise its purchase option or the Facility can be sold to a third
party.

The lease also provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73% of the acquisition cost,
by the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that the Company does not
renew the lease or purchase the Facility and that the fair market value is less than the
unamortized cost of the Facility. See Note 7 to the financial statements under  Operating Leases  
Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units  for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Credit Rating Risk 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases, fuel
purchases, fuel transportation and storage, emissions allowances, and energy price risk management.
At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at BBB-
and/or Baa3 rating were approximately $5 million. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential
collateral requirements under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately
$370 million. Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in
the event that one or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating
change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company
guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the
Company s ability to access capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

On September 2, 2009, Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) affirmed the credit ratings of the
Company s senior unsecured notes and commercial paper of A1/P-1, respectively, and revised the
rating outlook for the Company to negative. On September 4, 2009, Fitch Ratings, Inc. affirmed the
Company s senior unsecured notes and commercial paper ratings of AA-/F1 , respectively, and
maintained a stable rating outlook for the Company. On October 6, 2009, Standard and Poor s Rating
Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S P) affirmed the credit rating of the
Company s senior unsecured notes and its short-term rating of A/A-1, respectively, and maintained
its stable ratings outlook.

Market Price Risk 

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage
of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
The Company s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates
strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored
using techniques that include, but are not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress
testing, and sensitivity analysis.

The Company does not currently hedge interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate on
$120 million of variable rate long-term debt at January 1, 2010 was 0.54%. If the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt,
the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $1.2 million at January 1,
2010.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market. At December 31, 2009, exposure from these activities was not material to the Company s
financial statements.

In addition, per the guidelines of the Mississippi PSC, the Company has implemented a fuel-hedging
program. At December 31, 2009, exposure from these activities was not material to the Company s
financial statements.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

(a) 
       
     Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any. 

II-334 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The change in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the year
ended December 31, 2009 was an increase of $10.3 million, substantially all of which is due to
natural gas positions. The change is attributable to both the volume of million British thermal
units (mmBtu) and prices of natural gas. At December 31, 2009, the Company had a net hedge volume
of 23.7 million mmBtu with a weighted average contract cost of approximately $1.80 per mmBtu above
market prices, and 28.9 million mmBtu at December 31, 2008 with a weighted average contract cost of
approximately $1.89 per mmBtu above market prices. The majority of the natural gas hedge
settlements are recovered through the ECM clause.

At December 31, 2009, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge
designation was reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate to the
Company s fuel hedging program, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered
through the ECM clause. Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges are used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other
comprehensive income before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged
transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or
fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. The pre-tax
gains/(losses) reclassified from other comprehensive income to revenue and fuel expense were not
material for any period presented and are not expected to be material for 2010. Additionally,
there was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.

Unrealized pre-tax gains/(losses) from energy-related derivative contracts recognized in income
were not material for any year presented.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy
in which they fall at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

The Company uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using
prices which are actively quoted, and thus fall into Level 2. See Note 9 to the financial statements for further discussion on fair value measurement.

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
energy-related derivative contracts. The Company only enters into agreements and material
transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody s and S P or
with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For
additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under  Financial Instruments  and
Note 10 to the financial statements.

 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $472 million for 2010,
$661 million for 2011, and $1.3 billion for 2012. These estimates include costs for new generation
construction. Environmental expenditures included in these estimated amounts are $11 million,
$59 million, and $128 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The construction program is
subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these
estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
revised load growth estimates; storm impacts; changes in environmental statutes and regulations;
changes in FERC rules and regulations; Mississippi PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost
and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes;
and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital
expenditures will be fully recovered. See Note 3 to the financial statements under  Integrated
Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  for additional information.

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the FERC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred stock dividends, leases,
and other purchase commitments, are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, 7, and 10 to the financial
statements for additional information.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Contractual Obligations 

(a) 
       
     All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of January 1, 2010, as
reflected in the statements of capitalization. Excludes capital lease amounts (shown separately). 

(b) 
       
     Preferred stock does not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next five years only. 

(c) 
       
     For additional information, see Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements. 

(d) 
       
     The timing related to the realization of $3 million in unrecognized tax benefits and interest payments
in individual years beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated due to uncertainties
in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 5 to the financial
statements for additional information. 

(e) 
       
     The decrease from 2011-2012 to 2013-2014 is primarily a result of the Plant Daniel operating lease
contract that is scheduled to end during 2011. See Note 7 to the financial statements for additional
information. 

(f) 
       
     The capital lease of $6.4 million is being amortized over a five-year period ending in 2012. 

(g) 
       
     The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operations and
maintenance expenditures. Total other operations and maintenance expenses for 2009, 2008, and 2007
were $247 million, $260 million, and $255 million, respectively. 

(h) 
       
     The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent current
estimates of total expenditures. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase commitments were
outstanding in connection with the construction program. 

(i) 
       
     Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery. Amounts
reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31,
2009. 

(j) 
       
     Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices.

     The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. The Company expects
that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust fund is 2012. The
projections of the amount vary significantly depending on key variables including future trust fund
performance and cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no amounts related to the pension trust
fund are included in the table. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information
related to the pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit
payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from the
Company s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

General 

Mississippi Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is
the parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern
Power), Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC
Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company,
Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
companies, Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power), Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), Gulf Power
Company (Gulf Power), and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power), are vertically integrated
utilities providing electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a
vertically integrated utility providing service to retail customers in southeast Mississippi and to
wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages
generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the
system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its
subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by
Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and
provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding
company subsidiary for Southern Company s investments in leveraged leases. Southern Nuclear
operates and provides services to Southern Company s nuclear power plants.

The equity method is used for entities in which the Company has significant influence but does not
control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary beneficiary.
Certain prior years  data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions 

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
transactions. Costs for these services amounted to $84 million, $87 million, and $71.8 million
during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved
by the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to
be rendered at cost by system service companies.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such services from other Southern Company
subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. The Company provided no significant
service to an affiliate in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The Company received storm restoration assistance
from other Southern Company subsidiaries totaling $3.2 million in 2008. There was no storm
assistance received in 2009 or 2007.

The Company has an agreement with Alabama Power under which the Company owns a portion of Greene
County Steam Plant. Alabama Power operates Greene County Steam Plant, and the Company reimburses
Alabama Power for its proportionate share of all associated expenditures and costs. The Company
reimbursed Alabama Power for the Company s proportionate share of related expenses which totaled
$10.2 million, $11.1 million, and $9.8 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company
also has an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf Power owns a portion of Plant Daniel. The
Company operates Plant Daniel, and Gulf Power reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of
all associated expenditures and costs. Gulf Power reimbursed the Company for Gulf Power s
proportionate share of related expenses which totaled $20.9 million, $22.8 million, and
$23.1 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. See Note 4 for additional information.

NOTES (continued)  
 Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power may jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under  Fuel Commitments  for additional
information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 

The Company is subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board in accounting
for the effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues
associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking
process.

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 relate to:

Note: 
       
     The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

In the event that a portion of the Company s operations is no longer subject to applicable
accounting rules for rate regulation, the Company would be required to write off or reclassify to
accumulated other comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to
determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if
impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in
rates.

Government Grants 

The Company received a grant in October 2006 from the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) for
$276.4 million, primarily for storm damage cost recovery. In 2007, the Company received $109.3
million of storm restoration bond proceeds under the state bond program of which $25.2 million was
for retail storm restoration cost, $60.0 million was to increase the Company s retail property
damage reserve, and $24.1 million was to cover the retail portion of construction of a new storm
operations center. In 2008, the Company received grant payments in the amount of $7.3 million and
anticipates the receipt of approximately $3.2 million in 2010. The grant proceeds do not represent
a future obligation of the Company. The portion of any grants received related to retail storm
recovery was applied to the retail regulatory asset that was established as restoration costs were
incurred. The portion related to wholesale storm recovery was recorded either as a reduction to
operations and maintenance expense or as a reduction to total property, plant, and equipment
depending on the restoration work performed and the appropriate allocations of cost of service.

Revenues 

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Wholesale capacity revenues
from long-term contracts are recognized at the lesser of the levelized amount or the amount
billable under the contract over the respective contract period. Unbilled revenues related to
retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. The Company s retail and wholesale
rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Retail rates also include
provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in costs for ad valorem taxes and certain qualifying
environmental costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts
billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded
in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing
factors. The Company is required to file with the Mississippi PSC for an adjustment to the fuel
cost recovery factor annually.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. For years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, no
single customer or industry comprises 10% or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues.

Fuel Costs 

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes the cost of purchased
emissions allowances as they are used. Fuel costs also include gains and/or losses from fuel
hedging programs as approved by the Mississippi PSC.

Income and Other Taxes 

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with accounting standards related to the uncertainty in income taxes, the Company
recognizes tax positions that are  more likely than not  of being sustained upon examination by the
appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  for additional
information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction for projects
over $10 million.

II-348 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense except for the cost of maintenance of coal cars and a portion of the railway track
maintenance costs, which are charged to fuel stock and recovered through the Company s fuel clause.

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 3.3%, in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Depreciation studies are
conducted periodically to update the composite rates. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost, together with the cost
of removal, less salvage, is charged to the accumulated depreciation provision. Minor items of
property included in the original cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is
retired. Depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost of removal of facilities.
On September 8, 2009 and September 9, 2009, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC and the
FERC, respectively, a depreciation study as of December 31, 2008. The FERC accepted this study on
October 20, 2009.

In April 2007, the Mississippi PSC issued an order allowing the Company to defer certain
reliability related maintenance costs beginning January 1, 2007 and recover them evenly over a
four-year period beginning January 1, 2008. These costs related to maintenance that was needed as
follow-up to emergency repairs that were made subsequent to Hurricane Katrina. At December 31,
2007, the Company had incurred and deferred the retail portion of $9.5 million of such costs. At
December 31, 2009, the Company had a balance of the deferred retail portion of $4.7 million with
$2.3 million included in current assets as other regulatory assets and $2.4 million included in
other regulatory assets, deferred.

In December 2003, the Mississippi PSC issued an interim accounting order directing the Company to
expense and record a regulatory liability of $60.3 million while it considered the Company s
request to include 266 megawatts (MWs) of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 generating capacity in
jurisdictional cost of service. In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company s request
effective January 1, 2004, and ordered the Company to amortize the regulatory liability previously
established to reduce depreciation and amortization expenses over a four-year period. The amount
amortized in 2007 was $5.7 million. The regulatory liability was fully amortized as of December
31, 2007.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal 

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset s useful life.
The Company has received accounting guidance from the Mississippi PSC allowing the continued
accrual of other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a
legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are
reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.

The Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, underground storage
tanks, and asbestos removal. The Company also has identified retirement obligations related to
certain transmission and distribution facilities, co-generation facilities, certain wireless
communication towers, and certain structures authorized by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the
range of time over which the Company may settle these obligations is unknown and cannot be
reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize in the statements of income allowed
removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs
recognized and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability,
as ordered by the Mississippi PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets.

II-349 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles 

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the asset and recording a loss for the amount if the carrying value is greater than the
fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the
estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required.
Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Provision for Property Damage 

The Company carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and
general property. However, the Company is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other
uninsured casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution facilities. As
permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, the Company accrues for the cost of such damage
through an annual expense accrual credited to regulatory liability accounts for the retail and
wholesale jurisdictions. The cost of repairing actual damage resulting from such events that
individually exceed $50,000 is charged to the reserve. A 1999 Mississippi PSC order allowed the
Company to accrue $1.5 million to $4.6 million to the reserve annually, with a maximum reserve
totaling $23 million. In October 2006, in conjunction with the Mississippi PSC Hurricane
Katrina-related financing order, the Mississippi PSC ordered the Company to cease all accruals to
the retail property damage reserve until a new reserve cap is established. However, in the same
financing order, the Mississippi PSC approved the replenishment of the retail property damage
reserve with $60 million to be funded with a portion of the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the
Mississippi Development Bank on behalf of the State of Mississippi and reported as liabilities by
the State of Mississippi. The Company received the $60 million bond proceeds in June 2007. The
Company made no discretionary retail accruals in 2008 and 2007 as a result of the order. On
January 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC approved the System Restoration Rider (SRR) stipulation
between the Company and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff. In accordance with the
stipulation, every three years the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, and the
Company will agree on SRR revenue level(s) for the ensuing period, based on historical data,
expected exposure, type and amount of insurance coverage, excluding insurance cost, and any other
relevant information. The accrual amount and the reserve balance are determined based on the SRR
revenue  level(s).  If a significant change in circumstances occurs, then the SRR revenue level can
be adjusted more frequently if the Company and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff or the
Mississippi PSC deem the change appropriate. Each year the Company will set rates to collect the
approved SRR revenues. The property damage reserve accrual will be the difference between the
approved SRR revenues and the SRR revenue requirement, excluding any accrual to the reserve. In
2009, the Company made retail accruals of $3.7 million per the SRR order. In addition, SRR allows
the Company to set up a regulatory asset, pending review, if the allowable actual retail property
damage costs exceed the amount in the retail property damage reserve. See Note 3 under  Retail
Regulatory Matters   Storm Damage Cost Recovery  and  Retail Regulatory Matters   System
Restoration Rider  for additional information regarding the depletion of these reserves following
Hurricane Katrina and the deferral of additional costs, as well as additional rate riders or other
cost recovery mechanisms which have and/or may be approved by the Mississippi PSC to recover the
deferred costs and accrue reserves. The Company accrued $0.3 million in 2009 and $0.2 million
annually in 2008 and 2007 for the wholesale jurisdiction. See Note 3
under  FERC Matters  
Wholesale Rate Filing  for additional information.

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies 

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory 

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emissions allowances.
Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the Company
through fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Mississippi PSC. Emissions allowances granted by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in the prices
of certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative financial
instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (included in  Other  or shown separately
as  Risk Management Activities ) and are measured at fair value. See Note 9 for additional
information. Substantially all of the Company s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that
meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are
accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of
anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Mississippi PSC approved fuel hedging
program as discussed below. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in
net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are
recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. See Note 10 for additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
has no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2009.

The Mississippi PSC has approved the Company s request to implement an ECM which, among other
things, allows the Company to utilize financial instruments to hedge its fuel commitments. Changes
in the fair value of these financial instruments are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities.
Amounts paid or received as a result of financial settlement of these instruments are classified as
fuel expense and are included in the ECM factor applied to customer billings. The Company s
jurisdictional wholesale customers have a similar ECM mechanism, which has been approved by the
FERC.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties 
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive Income 

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value of
qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS 

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending
December 31, 2010. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension plans for a selected
group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified pension
plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The Company
funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC. For the year ending December 31, 2010,
postretirement trust contributions are expected to total approximately $0.2 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2009 and 2008 was December 31 while the
measurement date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to accounting standards related to
defined postretirement benefit plans, the Company was required to change the measurement date for
its defined postretirement benefit plans from September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions
effective January 1, 2008, resulting in an increase in long-term liabilities of $1.6 million and a
decrease in prepaid pension costs of approximately $0.1 million.

Pension Plans 

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $289 million in 2009 and $252
million in 2008. Changes during the plan year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15-month period
ended December 31, 2008 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were
as follows:

At December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $285.9 million and $23.3 million, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to
the qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). In
2009, in determining the optimal asset allocation for the pension fund, the Company performed an
extensive study based on projections of both assets and liabilities over a 10-year forward horizon.
The primary goal of the study was to maximize plan funded status. The Company s investment policy
covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real estate, and
private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily to gain efficient exposure to the
various asset classes and as hedging tools. The Company minimizes the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The actual composition of the Company s pension plan assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, along
with the targeted mix of assets, is presented below:

The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Company s defined benefit plan is to be
broadly diversified across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after
consideration of various factors that affect the assets and liabilities of the pension plan
including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns, volatility, correlations of asset
classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and
liabilities. Because a significant portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in
nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment expectations for return and
risk. To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the
Company employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment
managers and service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent
investment practices.

Detailed below is a description of the investment strategies for each major asset category
disclosed above:

Domestic equity.   This portion of the portfolio comprises a mix of large and small
capitalization stocks with generally an equal distribution of value and growth attributes
managed both actively and through passive index approaches. 

International equity.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed with a blend of
growth stocks and value stocks with both developed and emerging market exposure. 

Fixed income.   This portion of the portfolio is actively managed through an allocation to
long-dated, investment grade corporate and government bonds. 

Special situations.   Though currently unfunded, this portion of the portfolio was established
both to execute opportunistic investment strategies with the objectives of diversifying and
enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as to invest in promising
new strategies of a longer-term nature. 

Real estate investments.   Assets in this portion of the portfolio are invested in traditional
private market, equity-oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate securities. 

Private equity.   This portion of the portfolio generally consists of investments in private
partnerships that invest in private or public securities typically through privately
negotiated and/or structured transactions. Leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed
debt are examples of investment strategies within this category.

Changes in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 items in the pension plan assets valued
using significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as
follows:

The fair values presented above are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards
regarding fair value. For purposes of determining the fair value of the pension plan assets and
the appropriate level designation, management relies on information provided by the plan s trustee.
This information is reviewed and evaluated by management with changes made to the trustee
information as appropriate.

Securities for which the activity is observable on an active market or traded exchange are
categorized as Level 1. Fixed income securities classified as Level 2 are valued using matrix
pricing, a common model using observable inputs. Domestic and international equity securities
classified as Level 2 consist of pooled funds where the value is not quoted on an exchange but
where the value is determined using observable inputs from the market. Securities that are valued
using unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3 and include investments in real estate and
investments in limited partnerships. The Company invests (through the pension plan trustee)
directly in the limited partnerships which then invest in various types of funds or various private
entities within a fund. The fair value of the limited partnerships  investments is based on
audited annual capital accounts statements which are generally prepared on a fair value basis. The
Company also relies on the fact that, in most instances, the underlying assets held by the limited
partnerships are reported at fair value. External investment managers typically send valuations to
both the custodian and to the Company within 90 days of quarter end. The custodian reports the
most recent value available and adjusts the value for cash flows since the statement date for each
respective fund.

Amounts recognized in the balance sheets related to the Company s pension plan consist of the
following:

Presented below are the amounts included in regulatory assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 related
to the defined benefit pension plans that had not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost
along with the estimated amortization of such amounts for 2010.

The changes in the balances of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to the defined
benefit pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15 months ended December 31,
2008 are presented in the following table:

Components of net periodic pension cost (income) were as follows:

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs
netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value
of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to
amortize changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the
changes immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate
the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2009, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

Changes during the plan year ended December 31, 2009 and the 15-month period ended December 31,
2008 in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) and in the fair value of plan
assets were as follows:

Other postretirement benefit plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable
requirements, including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The Company s investment policy
covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real estate, and
private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily to gain efficient exposure to the
various asset classes and as hedging tools. The Company minimizes the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk. The actual

Components of the other postretirement benefit plans  net periodic cost were as follows:

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) provides
a 28% prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company s expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 by approximately $1.7
million, $1.8 million, and $1.8 million, respectively.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service and
are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for the
postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy receipts expected as
a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions 

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2006 for the 2007 plan year using a discount rate of 6.00% and an annual
salary increase of 3.50%.

The Company estimates the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit
plan assets using a financial model to project the expected return on each current investment
portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each of seven different asset
classes
in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust s
target asset allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on
four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset class (based in part on historical returns), each
trust s asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact of a periodic
rebalancing of each trust s portfolio.

II-361 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost
trend rate of 8.50% for 2010, decreasing gradually to 5.25% through the year 2016 and remaining at
that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate
of 1% would affect the APBO and the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2009 as
follows:

Employee Savings Plan 

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees.
The Company provides an 85% matching contribution up to 6% of an employee s base salary. Total
matching contributions made to the plan for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $3.9 million, $3.7 million,
and $3.5 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

General Litigation Matters 

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment such as regulation of air emissions and
water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including
property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental
requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury and other claims for damages caused
by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief
and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have become more
frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot
be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.

Environmental Matters 

New Source Review Actions  

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions
of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. These
actions were filed concurrently with the issuance of notices of violations to the Company with
respect to the Company s Plant Watson. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action,
the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA
alleges that NSR violations
occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
including one facility co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the Company as
a defendant based on the allegations in the notices of violation. However, in March 2001, the
court denied the motion based on lack of jurisdiction, and the EPA has not re-filed. The original
action, now solely against Georgia Power, has been administratively closed since the spring of
2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. In July 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power with respect to its
other affected units regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, which remains ongoing.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each

II-362 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in either of
these cases could require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently
budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require
payment of substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations,
cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

New York Case 

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies 
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company s and the other
defendants  motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005 and, on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court s ruling, vacating the dismissal of the
plaintiffs  claim, and remanding the case to the district court. On November 5, 2009, the
defendants, including Southern Company, sought rehearing en banc, and the court s ruling is subject
to potential appeal. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation  

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up

II-363 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

properties. The Company has authority from the Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental
compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms.

In 2003, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) designated the Company as a
potentially responsible party at a site in Texas. The site was owned by an electric transformer
company that handled the Company s transformers as well as those of many other entities. The site
owner is now in bankruptcy and the State of Texas has entered into an agreement with the Company
and several other utilities to investigate and remediate the site. Amounts expensed during 2007,
2008, and 2009 related to this work were not material. Hundreds of entities have received notices
from the TCEQ requesting their participation in the anticipated site remediation. The final impact
of this matter on the Company will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate
number of potentially responsible parties. The remediation expenses incurred by the Company are
expected to be recovered through the Environmental Compliance Overview (ECO) Plan.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the currently known
conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites, the
Company does not believe that additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material to
the financial statements.

FERC Matters 

Market-Based Rate Authority  

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company s generation market
power within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in
Southern Company s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended
in May 2006 could have been subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

On December 23, 2009, Southern Company and the FERC trial staff reached an agreement in principle
that would resolve the proceeding in its entirety. The agreement does not reflect any finding or
suggestion that the Company possesses or has exercised any market power. The agreement likewise
does not require the Company to make any refunds related to sales during the 15-month refund
period. Under the agreement, the Company will donate $0.1 million to nonprofit organizations in
the State of Mississippi for the purpose of offsetting the electricity bills of low-income retail
customers. The agreement is subject to review and approval by the FERC.

Intercompany Interchange Contract  

The Company s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies (including the Company), Southern
Power, and Southern Company Services, Inc., as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of
Southern Company is operated, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC s standards
of conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether
Southern Company s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a  system company  rather than a
 marketing affiliate  is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power,
the FERC authorized Southern Power s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously
approved Southern Company s code of conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement s terms.
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. In December 2008, the FERC division of audits issued
for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and related
matters. No comments were submitted challenging the audit report s findings of Southern Company s
compliance. The proceeding remains open pending a decision from the FERC regarding the audit
report.

Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Wholesale Rate Filing  

In August 2008, the Company filed with the FERC a request for revised wholesale electric tariff and
rates. Prior to making this filing, the Company reached a settlement with all of its customers who
take service under the tariff. This settlement agreement was filed with the FERC as part of the
request. The settlement agreement provided for an increase in annual base wholesale revenues in
the amount of $5.8 million, effective January 1, 2009. In addition, the settlement agreement
allows the Company to increase its annual accrual for the wholesale portion of property damage to
$303,000 per year, to defer any property damage costs prudently incurred in excess of the wholesale
property damage reserve balance, and to defer the wholesale portion of the generation screening and
evaluation costs associated with the integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) project to
be located in Kemper County Mississippi. The settlement agreement also provided that the Company
will not seek a change in wholesale full-requirements rates before November 1, 2010, except for
changes associated with the fuel adjustment clause and the ECM, changes associated with property
damages that exceed the amount in the wholesale property damage reserve, and changes associated
with costs and expenses associated with environmental requirements affecting fossil fuel generating
facilities. In October 2008, the Company received notice that the FERC had accepted the filing
effective November 1, 2008, and the revised monthly charges were applied beginning January 1, 2009.
As result of the order, the Company reclassified $9.3 million of previously expensed generation
screening and evaluation costs to a regulatory asset. See  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined
Cycle  herein for additional information.

Right of Way Litigation 

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company, have been named as
defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs  lawsuits claim
that defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic
communications lines on the rights of way that cross the plaintiffs  properties and that such
actions exceed the easements or other property rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert
claims for, among other things, trespass and unjust enrichment and seek compensatory and punitive
damages and injunctive relief. Management of the Company believes that it has complied with
applicable laws and that the plaintiffs  claims are without merit.

To date, the Company has entered into agreements with plaintiffs in approximately 95% of the
actions pending against the Company to clarify the Company s easement rights in the State of
Mississippi. These agreements have been approved by the Circuit Courts of Harrison County and
Jasper County, Mississippi (First Judicial Circuit), and the related cases have been dismissed.
These agreements have not resulted in any material effects on the Company s financial statements.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including the Company, were
named as defendants in a lawsuit brought in Troup County, Georgia, Superior Court by Interstate
Fibernet, Inc., a subsidiary of telecommunications company ITC DeltaCom, Inc. that uses certain of
the defendants  rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants are
contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the telecommunications company from
any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way litigation. The
Company believes that the plaintiff s claims are without merit. In the fall of 2004, the trial
court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner litigation discussed above. In
January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the telecommunications company s appeal of the
trial court s order for lack of jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an
adverse outcome against the telecommunications company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits,
could result in substantial judgments; however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be
determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters 

Performance Evaluation Plan  

The Company s retail base rates are set under the Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP), a rate plan
approved by the Mississippi PSC. PEP was designed with the objective that PEP would reduce the
impact of rate changes on the customer and provide incentives for the Company to keep customer
prices low and customer satisfaction and reliability high. PEP is a mechanism for rate adjustments
based on three indicators: price, customer satisfaction, and service reliability.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company s request to modify certain portions of the
PEP and to reclassify to jurisdictional cost of service the 266 MWs of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4
capacity, effective January 1, 2004. The Mississippi PSC authorized the Company to include the
related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue
requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery. The Company amortized the
regulatory liability pursuant to the

II-365 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Mississippi PSC s order, over a four-year period, resulting in increases to earnings in each of
those years. The final amortization of $5.7 million occurred in 2007.

In addition, in May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company s requested changes to PEP,
including the use of a forward-looking test year, with appropriate oversight; annual, rather than
semi-annual, filings; and certain changes to the performance indicator mechanisms. Rate changes
are limited to 4% of retail revenues annually under the revised PEP. PEP will remain in effect
until the Mississippi PSC modifies, suspends, or terminates the plan. In the May 2004 order, the
Mississippi PSC ordered that the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and the Company review the
operations of the PEP in 2007. By mutual agreement, this review was deferred until 2008 and
continued into 2009. On March 2, 2009, concurrent with this review, the annual PEP evaluation
filing for 2009 was suspended. On August 3, 2009, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and the
Company filed a joint report with the Mississippi PSC proposing several changes to the PEP. On
November 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC approved the revised PEP, which resulted in a lower
performance incentive under the PEP and therefore smaller and/or less frequent rate changes in the
future. On November 16, 2009, the Company resumed annual evaluations and filed its annual PEP
filing for 2010 under the revised PEP, which resulted in a lower allowed return on investment but
no rate change.

In April 2007, the Mississippi PSC issued an order allowing the Company to defer certain
reliability-related maintenance costs beginning January 1, 2007 and recover them evenly over a
four-year period beginning January 1, 2008. These costs related to maintenance that was needed as
follow-up to emergency repairs that were made subsequent to Hurricane Katrina. At December 31,
2007, the Company had incurred and deferred the retail portion of $9.5 million of such costs. At
December 31, 2009, the Company had a balance of the deferred retail portion of $4.7 million with
$2.3 million included in current assets as other regulatory assets and $2.4 million included in
long-term other regulatory assets.

In September 2007, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and the Company entered into a
stipulation that included adjustments to expenses which resulted in a one-time credit to retail
customers of approximately $1.1 million. In November 2007, the Mississippi PSC issued an order
requiring the Company to refund this amount to its retail customers no later than December 2007.
This amount was totally refunded as a credit to customer bills by December 31, 2007.

In December 2007, the Company submitted its annual PEP filing for 2008, which resulted in a rate
increase of 1.983% or $15.5 million annually, effective January 2008. In December 2006, the
Company submitted its annual PEP filing for 2007, which resulted in no rate change.

In December 2007, the Company received an order from the Mississippi PSC requiring it to defer $1.4
million associated with the retail portion of certain tax credits and adjustments related to
permanent differences pertaining to its 2006 income tax returns filed in September 2007. These tax
differences were recorded in a regulatory liability included in the current portion of other
regulatory liabilities and were amortized ratably over the 12-month period beginning January 2008.
The amortization of $1.4 million is included in income taxes on the statement of income for 2008.

On March 16, 2009, the Company submitted its annual PEP lookback filing for 2008, which recommended
no surcharge or refund. At the conclusion of the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff s review of
the PEP lookback filing for 2008, the Company and Mississippi Public Utilities Staff jointly
submitted a stipulation to the Mississippi PSC which recommended no surcharge or refund.

System Restoration Rider  

In September 2006, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC a request to implement a SRR to
increase the Company s cap on the property damage reserve and to authorize the calculation of an
annual property damage accrual based on a formula. The purpose of the SRR is to provide for
recovery of costs associated with property damage (including certain property insurance and the
costs of self insurance) and to facilitate the Mississippi PSC s review of these costs. The
Company would be required to make annual SRR filings to determine the revenue requirement
associated with the property damage. In November 2007, the Company along with the Mississippi
Public Utilities Staff agreed and stipulated to a revised SRR calculation method that would no
longer require the Mississippi PSC to set a cap on the property damage reserve or to authorize the
calculation of an annual property damage accrual. Under the revised SRR calculation method, the
Mississippi PSC would periodically agree on SRR revenue levels that would be developed based on
historical data, expected exposure, type and amount of insurance coverage excluding insurance
costs, and other relevant information.

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

On January 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order accepting the stipulation and the revised
SRR calculation method. The applicable SRR rate level will be adjusted every three years, unless a
significant change in circumstances occurs such that the Company and the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff or the Mississippi PSC deems that a more frequent change would be appropriate. The
Company will submit annual filings setting forth SRR-related revenues, expenses, and investment for
the projected filing period, as well as the true-up for the prior period. As a result, the
December 2008 retail regulatory liability of $6.8 million was reclassified to the property damage
reserve. On February 2, 2009, the Company submitted its 2009 SRR rate filing with the Mississippi
PSC, which proposed that the 2009 SRR rate level remain at zero and the Company be allowed to
accrue approximately $4.0 million to the property damage reserve in 2009. On September 10, 2009,
the Mississippi PSC issued an order requiring the Company to develop SRR factors designed to reduce
SRR revenue by approximately $1.5 million from November 2009 to March 2010 under the new rate. On
January 29, 2010, the Company submitted its 2010 SRR rate filing with the Mississippi PSC, which
proposed that the Company be allowed to accrue approximately $3.0 million to the property damage
reserve in 2010. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan  

On February 12, 2010, the Company submitted its 2010 ECO Plan notice which proposed an increase in
annual revenues for the Company of approximately $3.9 million. In its 2010 ECO filing, the Company
is proposing to change the true-up provision of the ECO rate schedule to consider actual revenues
collected in addition to actual costs. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.
On February 3, 2009, the Company submitted its 2009 ECO Plan notice which proposed an increase in
annual revenues for the Company of approximately $1.5 million. On June 19, 2009, the Mississippi
PSC approved the ECO Plan with the new rates effective June 2009. In February 2008, the Company
filed with the Mississippi PSC its annual ECO Plan evaluation for 2008. After the filing of the
ECO Plan evaluation in February 2008, the regulations addressing mercury emissions were altered by
a decision issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in February
2008. In April 2008, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC a supplemental ECO Plan evaluation
in which the projects included in the ECO Plan evaluation in February 2008 being undertaken
primarily for mercury control were removed. In this supplemental ECO Plan filing, the Company
requested a 15 cent per 1,000 kilowatt-hour decrease for retail residential customers. The
Mississippi PSC approved the supplemental ECO Plan evaluation in June 2008, with the new rates
effective in June 2008.

Fuel Cost Recovery  

The Company establishes, annually, a retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the
Mississippi PSC. The Company is required to file for an adjustment to the retail fuel cost
recovery factor annually; such filing occurred on November 16, 2009. The Mississippi PSC approved
the retail fuel cost recovery factor on December 15, 2009, with the new rates effective in January
2010. The retail fuel cost recovery factor will result in an annual decrease in an amount equal to
11.3% of total 2009 retail revenue. At December 31, 2009, the amount of over recovered retail fuel
cost included in the balance sheets was $29.4 million compared to $36.0 million under recovered at
December 31, 2008. The Company also has a wholesale Municipal and Rural Associations (MRA) and a
Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factor. Effective January 1, 2010, the wholesale MRA fuel
rate decreased, resulting in an annual decrease in an amount equal to 20.9% of total 2009 MRA
revenue. Effective February 1, 2010, the wholesale MB fuel rate decreased, resulting in an annual
decrease in an amount equal to 16.9% of total 2009 MB revenue. At December 31, 2009, the amount of
over recovered wholesale MRA and MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets was $16.8 million and
$2.4 million compared to $15.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively, under recovered at December
31, 2008. The Company s operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel
cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly,
this decrease to the billing factor will have no significant effect on the Company s revenues or
net income, but will decrease annual cash flow.

In October 2008, the Mississippi PSC opened a docket to investigate and review interest and
carrying charges under the fuel adjustment clause for utilities within the State of Mississippi
including the Company. On March 4, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order to apply the prime
rate in calculating the carrying costs on the retail over or under recovery balances related to
fuel cost recovery. On May 20, 2009, the Company filed the carrying cost calculation methodology
as part of its compliance filing.

In August 2009, the Mississippi PSC engaged an independent professional audit firm to conduct an
audit of the Company s fuel-related expenditures included in the fuel adjustment clause and energy
cost management clause of 2008 and 2009. The audit was completed in December 2009. There were no
audit findings identified in the audit.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery  

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States and caused significant
damage within the Company s service area. The estimated total storm restoration costs relating to
Hurricane Katrina through December 31, 2007 of $302.4 million, which was net of expected insurance
proceeds of approximately $77 million, without offset for the property damage reserve of
$3.0 million, was affirmed by the Mississippi PSC in June 2006, and the Company was ordered to
establish a regulatory asset for the retail portion. The Mississippi PSC issued an order directing
the Company to file an application with the MDA for a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). In
October 2006, the Company received from the MDA a CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million, which was
allocated to both the retail and wholesale jurisdictions. In the same month, the Mississippi PSC
issued a financing order that authorized the issuance of system restoration bonds for the remaining
$25.2 million of the retail portion of storm recovery costs not covered by the CDBG. These funds
were received in June 2007. The Company affirmed the $302.4 million total storm costs incurred as
of December 31, 2007. On March 2, 2009, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC its final
accounting of the restoration cost relating to Hurricane Katrina and the storm operations center.
The final net retail receivable of approximately $3.2 million is expected to be recovered in 2010.

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle 

On January 16, 2009, the Company filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with
the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. The plant would utilize an IGCC technology with an output capacity of 582
MWs. The Kemper IGCC will use locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a
proposed mine adjacent to the plant as fuel. This certificate, if approved by the Mississippi PSC,
would authorize the Company to acquire, construct, and operate the Kemper IGCC and related
facilities. The Kemper IGCC, subject to federal and state reviews and certain regulatory
approvals, is expected to begin commercial operation in May 2014. As part of its filing, the
Company has requested certain rate recovery treatment in accordance with the State of Mississippi
Baseload Act of 2008.

The Company filed an application in June 2006 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for certain
tax credits available to projects using clean coal technologies under the Energy Policy Act of
2005. The DOE subsequently certified the Kemper IGCC, and in November 2006 the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) allocated Internal Revenue Code Section 48A tax credits of $133 million to the
Company. On May 11, 2009, the Company received notification from the IRS formally certifying these
tax credits. The utilization of these credits is dependent upon meeting the certification
requirements for the Kemper IGCC, including an in-service date no later than May 2014. The Company
has secured all environmental reviews and permits necessary to commence construction of the Kemper
IGCC and has entered into a binding contract for the steam turbine generator, completing two
milestone requirements for the Section 48A credits.

In February 2008, the Company also requested that the DOE transfer the remaining funds previously
granted to a cancelled Southern Company project that would have been located in Orlando, Florida.
In December 2008, an agreement was reached to assign the remaining funds to the Kemper IGCC. The
estimated construction cost of the Kemper IGCC is approximately $2.4 billion, which is net of $245
million related to funding to be received from the DOE related to project construction. The
remaining DOE funding of $25 million is projected to be used for demonstration over the first few
years of operation.

On April 6, 2009, the Governor of the State of Mississippi signed into law a bill that will provide
an ad valorem tax exemption for a portion of the assessed value of all property utilized in certain
electric generating facilities with integrated gasification process facilities. This tax
exemption, which may not exceed 50% of the total value of the project, is for projects with a
capital investment from private sources of $1 billion or more. The Company expects the Kemper
IGCC, including the gasification portion, to be a qualifying project under the law.

Beginning in December 2006, the Mississippi PSC has approved the Company s requested accounting
treatment to defer the costs associated with the Company s generation resource planning,
evaluation, and screening activities as a regulatory asset. In December 2008, the Company
requested an amendment to its original order that would allow these costs to continue to be charged
to and remain in a regulatory asset until January 1, 2010. On April 6, 2009, the Company received
an accounting order from the Mississippi PSC directing the Company to continue to charge all
generation resource planning, evaluation, and screening costs to regulatory assets including those
costs associated with activities to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity and
costs necessary and prudent to preserve the availability, economic viability, and/or required
schedule of the Kemper IGCC generation resource planning, evaluation, and screening activities
until the Mississippi PSC makes findings and determination as to the recovery of the Company s
prudent expenditures. The Mississippi PSC s determination of prudence for the Company s
pre-construction costs is scheduled to occur by May 2010. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
spent a total of $73.5 million associated with the Company s

II-368 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

generation resource planning, evaluation, and screening activities, including regulatory filing
costs. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $31.2 million as compared to
$24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Of the total $73.5 million, $68.5 million was
deferred in other regulatory assets, $4.0 million was related to land purchases capitalized, and
$1.0 million was expensed.

On June 5, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order initiating an evaluation of the Kemper IGCC
and establishing a two-phase procedural schedule. On August 4, 2009, the Mississippi PSC ordered a
two-part hearing process to evaluate the need for and the resources and cost of the new generating
capacity separately. On November 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order that found the
Company has a demonstrated need for additional capacity of approximately 304 MWs to 1,276 MWs based
on an analysis of expected load forecasts, costs, and anticipated retirements. Hearings related to
the appropriate resource to meet that need as well as cost recovery of that resource through
application of the State of Mississippi s Baseload Act of 2008 were held in February 2010. A
decision on the resources and cost recovery is expected to be made by May 1, 2010.

On September 15, 2009, South Mississippi Electric Power Association (SMEPA) signed a non-binding
letter of intent to explore the acquisition of an interest in the Kemper IGCC. The Company and
SMEPA are evaluating a combination of a joint ownership arrangement and a power purchase agreement
which would provide SMEPA with up to 20% of the capacity and associated energy output from the
Kemper IGCC.

The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS 

The Company and Alabama Power own, as tenants in common, Units 1 and 2 (total capacity of 500 MWs)
at Greene County Steam Plant, which is located in Alabama and operated by Alabama Power.
Additionally, the Company and Gulf Power, own as tenants in common, Units 1 and 2 (total capacity
of 1,000 MWs) at Plant Daniel, which is located in Mississippi and operated by the Company.

At December 31, 2009, the Company s percentage ownership and investment in these jointly owned
facilities were as follows:

The Company s proportionate share of plant operating expenses is included in the statements of
income and the Company is responsible for its own financing.

5. INCOME TAXES 

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined income tax returns for
the State of Alabama and the State of Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax
allocation agreement, each subsidiary s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the tax liability.

Current and Deferred Income Taxes 

Details of the income tax provisions were as follows:

The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and their respective tax bases, which give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities, are as follows:

II-370 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $9.0 million and
$14.9 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the
lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $1.2
million, $1.2 million, and $1.1 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. At December 31,
2009, all investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

Effective Tax Rate 

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the
applicable U.S. federal statutory rate to earnings before income taxes and preferred dividends as a
result of the following:

(a)  
       
     Amortization of Regulatory Liability Tax Credits. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Performance Evaluation Plan.  

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income
attributable to U.S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code Section 199
(production activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified
production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010
with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007
through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for
calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company reached an agreement with the IRS on a
calculation methodology and signed a closing agreement in December 2008. Therefore, in 2008, the
Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit related to the calculation methodology and adjusted
the deduction for all previous years to conform to the agreement which resulted in a decrease in
the 2008 deduction when compared to the 2007 deduction. Certain aspects of the production
activities deduction remain unresolved. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax
benefits combined with the application of the new methodology had no material effect on the
Company s financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

For 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $1.2 million, resulting in a
balance of $3.0 million as of December 31, 2009.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

II-371 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The tax positions from current periods increase for 2009 relate primarily to the production
activities deduction tax position and other miscellaneous uncertain tax positions. The tax
positions increase from prior periods for 2009 relates primarily to the production activities deduction tax
position. See  Effective Tax Rate  above for additional information.

Impact on the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized, is as follows:

Accrued interest for unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

The Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The Company did not
accrue any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to a majority of
the Company s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12
months. The possible conclusion or settlement of state audits could impact the balances
significantly. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be
determined.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2006.

6. FINANCING 

Bank Term Loans 

In 2008, the Company borrowed $80 million under a three-year term loan agreement. The proceeds
were used for general corporate purposes, including the Company s continuous construction program.

Senior Notes 

In March 2009, the Company issued $125 million of Series 2009A 5.55% Senior Notes due March 1,
2019. Proceeds were used to repay at maturity the Company s $40.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Series F Floating Rate Senior Notes due March 9, 2009, to repay a portion of its
short-term indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including the Company s continuous
construction program. In November 2008, the Company issued $50.0 million of Series 2008A 6.00%
Senior Notes due November 15, 2013. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had a total of $330
million and $245 million, respectively, of senior notes outstanding.

Securities Due Within One Year 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company has scheduled maturities of capital leases due within
one year of $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the Company also
had senior notes of $40.0 million due within one year.

Maturities through 2013 applicable to total long-term debt are as follows: $1.3 million in 2010;
$81.4 million in 2011; $0.6 million in 2012; and $50.0 million in 2013. There are no scheduled
maturities in 2014.

Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for authorities to meet principal
and interest requirements of such bonds. The amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds
outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $82.7 million. In September 2008, the Company was
required to purchase a total of approximately $7.9 million of variable rate pollution control
revenue bonds that were tendered by investors. In December 2008, the bonds were successfully
remarketed. On the statement of cash flow for 2008, the $7.9 million is presented as proceeds and
redemptions.

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock 

The Company currently has preferred stock (including depositary shares which represent one-fourth
of a share of preferred stock) and common stock authorized and outstanding. The preferred stock of
the Company contains a feature that allows the holders to elect a majority of the Company s board
of directors if dividends are not paid for four consecutive quarters. Because such a potential
redemption-triggering event is not solely within the control of the Company, this preferred stock
is presented as  Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock  in a manner consistent with temporary
equity under applicable accounting standards. The Company s preferred stock and depositary
preferred stock, without preference between classes, rank senior to the Company s common stock with
respect to payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Certain series of the
preferred stock and depositary preferred stock are subject to redemption at the option of the
Company on or after a specified date (typically five or 10 years after the date of issuance) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation amount of the stock.

Dividend Restrictions 

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

Bank Credit Arrangements 

At the beginning of 2010, the Company had total unused committed credit agreements with banks of
$156 million, all of which expire in 2010. Approximately $41 million of the facilities contain
two-year term loan options and $15 million contain one-year term loan options. The Company expects
to renew its credit facilities, as needed, prior to expiration.

In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company agrees to pay commitment fees based on
the unused portions of the commitments or to maintain compensating balances with the banks.
Commitment fees average less than 1/4 of 1% for the Company. Compensating balances are not legally
restricted from withdrawal.

The credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to capitalization
(each as defined in the arrangements) to 65%. For purposes of these definitions, indebtedness
excludes long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts and, in certain cases, other hybrid
securities.

In addition, the credit arrangements contain cross default provisions that would trigger an event
of default if the Company defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. At December
31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. None of the arrangements contain
material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowing.

This $156 million in unused credit arrangements provides required liquidity support to the
Company s borrowings through a commercial paper program. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no
commercial paper outstanding. The credit arrangements also provide support to the Company s
variable rate tax-exempt pollution control bonds totaling $40.1 million. During 2009, the peak
amount outstanding for short-term debt was $66.7 million and the average amount outstanding was
$15.9 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt was 0.3% for 2009 and 2.6% for
2008.

7. COMMITMENTS 

Construction Program 

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total
$472 million in 2010, $661 million in 2011, and $1.3 billion in 2012. The construction program is
subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these
estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
revised load growth

II-373 

Table of Contents

Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

estimates; storm impacts; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; Mississippi PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of
capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be
fully recovered. At December 31, 2009, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program. Capital improvements to generating, transmission, and
distribution facilities, including those to meet environmental standards, will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements 

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for the leased combined cycle units at Plant Daniel.
The LTSA provides that GE will cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which
generally includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of
unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in the LTSA.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles of the units. Scheduled
payments to GE under the LTSA, which are subject to price escalation, are made monthly based on
estimated operating hours of the units and are recognized as expense based on actual hours of
operation. The Company has recognized $13.3 million, $9.4 million, and $9.7 million for 2009,
2008, and 2007, respectively, which is included in maintenance expense in the statements of income.
Remaining payments to GE under the LTSA are currently estimated to total $121 million over the
next 11 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at the option of the
Company.

The Company also has entered into a LTSA with Alstom Power, Inc. for the purpose of securing
maintenance support for its Chevron Unit 5 combustion turbine plant. In summary, the LTSA
stipulates that Alstom Power, Inc. will perform all planned maintenance on the covered equipment,
which includes the cost of all labor and materials. Alstom Power, Inc is also obligated to cover
the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the
LTSA.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles. Scheduled payments to
Alstom Power, Inc., which are subject to price escalation, are made at various intervals based on
actual operating hours of the unit. Payments to Alstom Power, Inc. under the LTSA are currently
estimated to total $22.3 million over the remaining term of the LTSA, which is approximately eight
years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at the option of the Company.
Payments made to Alstom Power, Inc. under the LTSA prior to the performance of any planned
maintenance are recorded as a prepayment in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are capitalized
or charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed. After the LTSA expires, the
Company expects to replace it with a new contract with similar terms.

Fuel Commitments 

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil fuel. In most cases, these contracts
contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on
various indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent estimates
based on New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2009.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the Company s future needs.

Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent
for the Company and the other traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Under these
agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power may be jointly and
severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to the
creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered
into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional operating companies to
ensure the Company will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or
damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these
agreements.

Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units  

In May 2001, the Company began the initial 10-year term of the lease agreement for a 1,064-MW
natural gas combined cycle generating facility built at Plant Daniel (Facility). The lease
arrangement provided a lower cost alternative to its cost based rate regulated customers than a
traditional rate base asset. See Note 3 under  Retail Regulatory Matters   Performance Evaluation
Plan  for a description of the Company s formulary rate plan.

In 2003, the Facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), whose partners are
unaffiliated with the Company. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease agreement
with the Company. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties unrelated to the
Company. The assets leased by the Company comprise less than 50% of Juniper s assets. The Company
is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities, and the lease with
Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease agreement is treated as an operating lease for
accounting purposes as well as for both retail and wholesale rate recovery purposes. For income
tax purposes, the Company retains tax ownership. The initial lease term ends in 2011 and the lease
includes a purchase and renewal option based on the cost of the Facility at the inception of the
lease, which was $370 million. The Company is required to amortize approximately 4% of the initial
acquisition cost over the initial lease term. In April 2010, 18 months prior to the end of the
initial lease, the Company must notify Juniper if the lease will be terminated. The Company may
elect to renew the lease for 10 years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for the
Company to amortize an additional 17% of the initial completion cost over the renewal period. Upon
termination of the lease, at the Company s option, it may either exercise its purchase option or
the Facility can be sold to a third party. If the Company does not exercise either its purchase
option or its renewal option, the Company could lose its rights to some or all of the 1,064 MWs of
capacity at that time.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73% of the acquisition cost, by
the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that the Company does not renew
the lease or purchase the Facility and that the fair market value is less than the unamortized cost
of the Facility. A liability of approximately $3 million, $5 million, and $7 million for the fair
market value of this residual value guarantee is included in the balance sheets at December 31,
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Lease expenses were $26 million, $26 million, and $27 million
in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

The Company estimates that its annual amount of future minimum operating lease payments under this
arrangement, exclusive of any payment related to the residual value guarantee, as of December 31,
2009, are as follows:

Other Operating Leases  

The Company and Gulf Power have jointly entered into operating lease agreements for the use of 745
aluminum railcars. The Company has the option to purchase the railcars at the greater of lease
termination value or fair market value, or to renew the leases at the end of the lease term. The
Company also has multiple operating lease agreements for the use of additional railcars that do not
contain a purchase option. All of these leases are for the transport of coal to Plant Daniel.

II-375 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s share (50%) of the leases, charged to fuel stock and recovered through the fuel cost
recovery clause, was $4.0 million in 2009, $4.0 million in 2008, and $4.4 million in 2007. The
Company s annual railcar lease payments for 2010 through 2014 will average approximately
$1.7 million and after 2014, lease payments total in aggregate approximately $1.6 million.

In addition to railcar leases, the Company has other operating leases for fuel handling equipment
at Plants Daniel and Watson and operating leases for barges and tow/shift boats for the transport
of coal at Plant Watson. The Company s share (50% at Plant Daniel and 100% at Plant Watson) of the
leases for fuel handling was charged to fuel handling expense in the amount of $0.6 million in 2009
and $0.6 million in 2008. The Company s annual lease payments for 2010 through 2014 will average
approximately $0.3 million for fuel handling equipment. The Company charged to fuel stock and
recovered through fuel cost recovery the barge transportation leases in the amount of $8.4 million
in 2009 and $9.8 million in 2008 related to barges and tow/shift boats. The Company s annual lease
payments for 2010 through 2014 with respect to these barge transportation leases will average
approximately $7.7 million.

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN 

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2009, there were 282 current and
former employees of the Company participating in the stock option plan and there were 21 million
shares of Southern Company common stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices
of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant.
Options granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the
date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are
eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards, a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company s stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company used historical
exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that options granted
to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date
fair value of stock options granted:

The Company s activity in the stock option plan for 2009 is summarized below:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2009 was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2009 as
stated above. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6.3 years and 4.8 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $4.3 million and
$3.4 million, respectively.

II-376 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

As of December 31, 2009, there was $0.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 10 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $0.9 million, $0.7 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, with
the related tax benefit also recognized in income of $0.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million,
respectively.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and exercise of Southern Company stock
options to the Company s employees are recognized in the Company s financial statements with a
corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007 was $0.4 million, $3.7 million, and $2.2 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit
realized by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises totaled $0.2 million,
$1.4 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007.

9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The fair value measurement is based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a
market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is
maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value
measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques used for fair value measurement.

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or
liabilities. 

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is
either directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of
the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If
there is little available market data, then the Company s own assumptions are the best
available information. 

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

The fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis and the level of the fair value
hierarchy in which they fall at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

Energy-related derivatives primarily consist of over-the-counter contracts. See Note 10 for
additional information. The cash equivalents consist of securities with original maturities of
90 days or less. All of these financial instruments and investments are valued primarily using
the market approach.

II-377 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

As of December 31, 2009, the fair value measurements of investments calculated at net asset
value per share (or its equivalent), as well as the nature and risks of those investments, are
as follows:

The money market funds are short-term investments of excess funds in various money market mutual
funds, which are portfolios of short-term debt securities. The money market funds are regulated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and typically receive the highest rating from credit rating
agencies. Regulatory and rating agency requirements for money market funds include minimum credit
ratings and maximum maturities for individual securities and a maximum weighted average portfolio
maturity. Redemptions are available on a same day basis, up to the full amount of the Company s
investment in the money market funds.

As of December 31, 2009, other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal
fair value were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2).

10. DERIVATIVES 

The Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk. To
manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets its exposures, where
possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. The Company s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily
for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are
recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.

Energy-Related Derivatives 

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
manages fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of the Mississippi PSC, through the
use of financial derivative contracts.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
physical fixed-price or heat rate contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the
wholesale electricity market. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in gas prices, the
Company may enter into fixed-price contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant
portion of contracts are priced at market.

Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for in one of three methods:

Regulatory Hedges    Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory
hedges relate primarily to the Company s fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are
initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included
in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through
the respective fuel cost recovery clauses. 

Cash Flow Hedges    Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges, are used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other
comprehensive income (OCI) before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged
transactions are reflected in earnings. 

II-378 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

Not Designated    Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as
incurred. 

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial
settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric industry.
When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or
loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the
actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

At December 31, 2009, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas
positions for the Company, together with the longest hedge date over which it is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest date
for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

* 
       
     mmBtu   million British thermal units 

For cash flow hedges, the amounts expected to be reclassified from OCI to revenue and fuel
expense for the next 12-month period ending December 31, 2010 are immaterial.

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of energy-related derivatives was reflected in the
balance sheets as follows:

All derivative instruments are measured at fair value. See Note 9 for additional information.

II-379 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Mississippi Power Company 2009 Annual Report 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the pre-tax effect of unrealized derivative gains (losses) arising
from energy-related derivative instruments designated as regulatory hedging instruments and
deferred on the balance sheets were as follows:

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the pre-tax effect of energy-related
derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments on the statements of income were as
follows:

There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the pre-tax effect of energy-related
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on the statements of income were immaterial.

Contingent Features 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating
changes of certain affiliated companies. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of derivative
liabilities with contingent features was $3.9 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no collateral posted with its derivative counterparties;
however, because of the joint and several liability features underlying these derivatives, the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features,
at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, is $33.3 million.

Currently, the Company has investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to debt and preferred stock.

Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash.
The Company participated in certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one
or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below
investment grade.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Southern Power Company 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Power Company and
Subsidiary Companies (the  Company ) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, common stockholder s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements (pages II-407 to II-428) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

OVERVIEW 

Business Activities 

Southern Power Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company) construct, acquire, own, and
manage generation assets and sell electricity at market-based prices in the wholesale market. The
Company continues to execute its strategy through a combination of acquiring and constructing new
power plants and by entering into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with investor owned utilities,
independent power producers, municipalities, and electric cooperatives.

In October 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of Nacogdoches
Power LLC (Nacogdoches) from American Renewables, LLC, the developer of the project. The Company
is constructing a biomass generating plant near Sacul, Texas with an estimated capacity of 100
megawatts (MWs). The generating plant will be fueled from wood waste. Construction commenced in
late 2009 and the plant is expected to begin commercial operation in 2012. The output of the plant
will be sold under a long-term PPA.

In December 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of West Georgia
Generating Company, LLC (West Georgia) from Broadway Gen Funding, LLC (Broadway), an affiliate of
LS Power. West Georgia was merged into the Company and the Company now owns a 669-MW nameplate
capacity generating facility consisting of four combustion turbine natural gas generating units
with oil back-up. The output from two units is sold under long-term PPAs.

In December 2009, the Company transferred all of the outstanding membership interests of DeSoto
County Generating Company LLC (DeSoto) to Broadway as part of the acquisition of West Georgia.

The Company continued construction of an electric generating plant in Cleveland County, North
Carolina. This plant will consist of four combustion turbine natural gas generating units with a
total expected generating capacity of 720 MWs. The units are expected to begin commercial
operation in 2012. The Company has entered into long-term PPAs for 540 MWs of the generating
capacity of the plant.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had units totaling 7,880 MWs nameplate capacity in commercial
operation. The weighted average duration of the Company s wholesale contracts exceeds 11.7 years,
which reduces remarketing risk. The Company s future earnings will depend on the parameters of the
wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for additional information.

Key Performance Indicators 

To evaluate operating results and to ensure the Company s ability to meet its contractual
commitments to customers, the Company focuses on several key performance indicators. These
indicators include peak season equivalent forced outage rate (EFOR), return on invested capital
(ROIC), and net income. EFOR defines the hours during peak demand times when the Company s
generating units are not available due to forced outages (the lower the better). ROIC is focused
on earning a return on all invested capital that meets or exceeds the Company s weighted average
cost of capital. Net income is the primary measure of the Company s financial
performance. The Company s actual performance in 2009 met or surpassed targets in these key
performance areas. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company s
financial performance.

Earnings 

The Company s 2009 net income was $155.9 million, an $11.5 million increase over 2008. This
increase was primarily due to increased margins associated with the operation of Plant Franklin
Unit 3 for all of 2009, increased generation from the Company s combined cycle units due to lower
natural gas prices, and profit recognized under a construction contract with the Orlando Utilities
Commission (OUC) whereby the Company provided engineering, procurement, and construction services
to build a combined cycle unit for the OUC. These favorable impacts were partially offset by a
loss recognized on the transfer of DeSoto to Broadway in December 2009, gains recognized in income
in 2008 related to the sale of an undeveloped tract of land in Orange County, Florida to the OUC,
and the receipt of a fee for participating in an asset auction as an unsuccessful bidder.
Additionally, depreciation increased due to the completion of Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008
and an increase in depreciation rates. Interest expense increased due to a reduction of
capitalized interest as a result of the completion of Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008.

II-387

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s 2008 net income was $144.4 million, a $12.7 million increase over 2007. This
increase was primarily due to increased capacity sales to requirements service customers, market
sales of uncontracted generating capacity, a gain on the sale of an undeveloped tract of land in
2008, a loss on the gasifier portion of the integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
project in 2007, and the receipt of a fee for participating in an asset auction in 2008 as an
unsuccessful bidder. These increases were partially offset by transmission service expenses and
tariff penalties incurred in 2008, timing of plant maintenance activities, increased general and
administrative expenses associated with the implementation of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) separation order, and increased depreciation associated with Plant Oleander Unit
5 and Plant Franklin Unit 3 being placed into commercial operation in December 2007 and June 2008,
respectively.

The Company s 2007 net income was $131.6 million, a $7.2 million increase over 2006. This increase
was primarily due to increased energy sales due to more favorable weather in 2007. Also
contributing to the increase were additional sales from the acquisition of Plant Rowan in September
2006. These increases were partially offset by the $10.7 million after tax loss as a result of the
termination of the construction of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

A condensed statement of income follows:

Operating Revenues  

Operating revenues in 2009 were $946.7 million, a $366.9 million (27.9%) decrease from 2008. This
decrease was primarily due to lower natural gas prices that reduced energy revenues. This decrease
was partially offset by increased capacity and energy revenues from the operation of Plant Franklin
Unit 3 and a PPA relating to four units at Plant Dahlberg that began in June 2009.

Operating revenues in 2008 were $1.31 billion, a $341.5 million (35.1%) increase from 2007. This
increase was primarily due to increased short-term energy revenues from uncontracted generating
units, increased energy revenues due to higher natural gas prices, and increased revenues from a
full year of operations at Plant Oleander Unit 5. These increases were partially offset by
decreased demand under existing PPAs due to less favorable weather in 2008 compared to 2007. The
increase in fuel revenues was accompanied by an increase in related fuel costs and did not have a
significant impact on net income.

Operating revenues in 2007 were $972 million, a $195.0 million (25.1%) increase from 2006. This
increase was primarily due to increased short-term energy sales, a full year of operations at Plant
Rowan acquired in September 2006, new sales with EnergyUnited Electric Membership Cooperative
(EnergyUnited), increased demand under existing PPAs with affiliates as a result of favorable
weather within the Southern Company system service territory, and higher fuel revenues due to an
increase in natural gas prices in 2007. The increase in fuel revenues was accompanied by an
increase in related fuel costs and did not have a significant impact on net income.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Capacity revenues are an integral component of the Company s PPAs with both affiliate and
non-affiliate customers and represent the greatest contribution to net income. Energy under the
PPAs is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published gas indices. Energy revenues
also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Details of these PPA
capacity and energy revenues are as follows:

Wholesale revenues that were not covered by PPAs totaled $98.9 million in 2009, which included
$64.0 million of revenues from affiliated companies. Wholesale revenues that were not covered by
PPAs totaled $349.2 million in 2008, which included $95.5 million of revenues from affiliated
companies. Wholesale revenues that were not covered by PPAs totaled $131.0 million in 2007, which
included $40.0 million of revenues from affiliated companies. These wholesale sales were made in
accordance with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the FERC. These
non-PPA wholesale revenues will vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability and
cost of generating resources at each company that participates in the centralized operation and
dispatch of the Southern Company system fleet of generating plants (power pool).

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses  

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. Additionally, the Company
purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

Details of the Company s fuel and purchased power expenditures are as follows:

In 2009, total fuel and purchased power expenses decreased by $376.4 million (50.0%) compared to
2008. This decrease was driven by a 56.0% decrease in the average cost of natural gas and a 41.3%
decrease in the average cost of purchased power. Additionally, purchased power volume decreased
25.2% primarily due to increased generation at the Company s combined cycle units as a result of
lower natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by a 31.2% increase in generation
at the Company s combined cycle units as a result of lower natural gas prices. In 2008, total fuel
and purchased power expenses increased by $314.2 million (71.6%) compared to 2007. This increase
was driven by a 58.9% increase in generation due to operations at Plant Franklin Unit 3, an 11.9%
increase in the average cost of natural gas, and a 107.9% increase in the average cost of purchased
power. In 2007, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased by $122.7 million (38.8%)
compared to 2006. This increase was driven by a 43.7% increase in generation at Plants Wansley and
Dahlberg, a 5.2% increase in the average cost of natural gas, increased purchases of lower cost
energy resources from the power pool and non-affiliates, and contracts with Georgia Electric
Membership Corporations and Dalton Utilities.

In 2009, fuel expense decreased by $192.3 million (45.3%) compared to 2008. This decrease was
driven by a 56.0% decrease in the average cost of natural gas. This decrease was partially offset
by a 31.2% increase in generation at the Company s combined cycle units as a result of lower
natural gas prices. In 2008, fuel expense increased by $186.1 million (78.0%) compared to 2007.
This increase was driven by a 58.9% increase in generation primarily due to operations at Plant
Franklin Unit 3 and an 11.9% increase in the average cost of natural gas. In 2007, fuel expense
increased by $93.4 million (64.3%) compared to 2006. This increase was driven by a 43.7% increase
in generation at Plants Wansley and Dahlberg and a 5.2% increase in the average cost of natural
gas.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

In 2009, purchased power expense decreased $184.0 million (56.1%) compared to 2008, primarily due
to a 41.3% decrease in the average cost of purchased power. Additionally, purchased power volume
in 2009 decreased 25.2% due to increased generation at the Company s combined cycle units as a
result of lower natural gas prices. Purchased power expense increased $128.1 million (64.1%) in
2008 when compared to 2007, primarily due to a 107.9% increase in the average cost of purchased
power. Purchased power expense increased $29.3 million (17.1%) in 2007 when compared to 2006,
primarily due to increased purchases of lower cost energy resources from the power pool and
non-affiliates and contracts with Georgia Electric Membership Corporation and Dalton Utilities.

The Company s PPAs generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for substantially all of
the cost of fuel. Consequently, any increase or decrease in fuel costs is accompanied by an
increase or decrease in related fuel revenues and does not have a significant impact on net income.
The Company is responsible for the cost of fuel for units that are not covered under PPAs. Power
from these units is sold into the market or sold to affiliates under the IIC.

Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources available throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load
requirements are submitted to the power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest
cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by the Company, affiliate-owned generation, or
external purchases.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses  

In 2009, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $11.1 million (7.5%) compared to 2008.
This decrease was due primarily to transmission tariff penalties recognized in 2008, reduced
transmission expenses due to a decrease in power sales into the market, and the timing of plant
outages.

In 2008, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $12.7 million (9.4%) compared to 2007.
This increase was due primarily to the timing of plant maintenance activities, transmission tariff
penalties, and additional administrative and general expenses as a result of costs incurred to
implement the FERC compliance plan. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under  FERC Matters  
Intercompany Interchange Contract  for additional information.

In 2007, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $39.7 million (41.7%) compared to
2006. This increase was due primarily to a full year of operations at Plant DeSoto and Plant Rowan
acquired in June 2006 and September 2006, respectively, and additional administrative and general
expenses as a result of costs incurred to implement the FERC compliance plan. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under  FERC Matters   Intercompany Interchange Contract  for additional
information.

Loss (Gain) on Sale of Property  

In December 2009, the Company recorded a loss of $5.0 million on the transfer of DeSoto to
Broadway. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Acquisitions and
Divestitures   West Georgia
Acquisition and Plant DeSoto Divestiture  herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under
 Acquisitions and Divestitures   West Georgia Generating Company, LLC Acquisition and DeSoto County
Generating Company, LLC Divestiture  for additional information.

In January 2008, the Company recorded a gain of $6.0 million on the sale of an undeveloped tract of
land.

Loss on IGCC Project  

In November 2007, the Company and the OUC mutually agreed to terminate the construction of the
gasifier portion of the IGCC project, originally planned as a joint venture; however, the Company
continued construction of the gas-fired combined cycle generating facility, owned solely by the
OUC. The Company recorded a loss in the fourth quarter 2007 of $17.6 million related to the
cancellation of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. This loss consists of the write-off of
construction costs of $14.0 million and an accrual for termination payments of $3.6 million. All
termination payments were completed in 2008.

 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Depreciation and Amortization  

In 2009, depreciation and amortization increased $9.6 million (10.9%) compared to 2008. This
increase was primarily due to the completion of Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008 and higher
depreciation rates implemented during 2009.

In 2008, depreciation and amortization increased $14.5 million (19.7%) due to the completion of
Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008 and higher depreciation rates implemented in January 2008.

In 2007, depreciation and amortization increased $8.0 million (12.2%) due to the completion of
Plant Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007 and additional depreciation related to Plants DeSoto and
Rowan acquired in June 2006 and September 2006, respectively, and higher depreciation rates from a
study adopted in March 2006.

See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Other Matters  herein for additional information regarding the
Company s ongoing review of depreciation estimates. See also Note 1 to the financial statements
under  Depreciation  for additional information.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes  

The 2009 decrease in taxes other than income taxes was not material.

In 2008, taxes other than income taxes increased $2.0 million (12.4%) compared to 2007. This
increase was primarily due to property taxes related to the completion of Plant Oleander Unit 5 and
Plant Franklin Unit 3 in December 2007 and June 2008, respectively.

The 2007 increase in taxes other than income taxes was not material.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized  

In 2009, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $1.8 million (2.1%) compared to
2008. This increase was primarily due to a $5.5 million decrease in capitalized interest as a
result of the completion of Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008, partially offset by a $1.7 million
decrease in short-term borrowing levels during 2009 and a decrease in amortization of interest rate
derivatives of $2.1 million.

In 2008, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $4.0 million (5.1%) compared to
2007. This increase was primarily the result of a decrease in capitalized interest as a result of
the completion of Plant Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007 and Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008,
partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowing levels in 2008.

In 2007, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $1.0 million (1.2%) compared to
2006. This decrease was primarily due to additional capitalized interest of $10.9 million on
active construction projects and reduced interest on commercial paper of $2.0 million due to lower
borrowing levels. This decrease was partially offset by an $11.9 million increase in interest on
$200 million of senior notes that were issued in November 2006.

Profit Recognized on Construction Contract  

Profit recognized on the construction contract with the OUC whereby the Company has provided
engineering, procurement, and construction services to build a combined cycle unit for the OUC was
$13.3 million in 2009. No profit or loss on this contract was recognized in 2008 or 2007.

Other Income (Expense), Net  

Other income (expense), net was an expense of $0.4 million in 2009 versus income of $7.6 million in
2008. This change was primarily due to a $6.4 million fee received in 2008 for participating in an
asset auction. The Company was not the successful bidder in the asset auction.

Other income (expense), net increased $4.3 million (131.1%) in 2008. This increase was primarily
due to a $6.4 million fee received in 2008 for participating in an asset auction. The Company was
not the successful bidder in the asset auction.

Changes in other income (expense), net in 2007 were not material.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Income Taxes  

In 2009, income taxes decreased $7.3 million (7.8%) compared to 2008. This decrease was due to
changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code), Section 199
production activities deduction, lower state income taxes, and tax benefits received under convertible investment tax credits.
Higher pre-tax earnings partially offset these decreases. See Note 5 to the financial statements
for additional information.

Income taxes increased $9.3 million (11.2%) in 2008 and $1.7 million (2.1%) in 2007 primarily due
to higher pre-tax earnings and changes in the Section 199 production activities deduction.

Effects of Inflation 

The Company is party to long-term contracts reflecting market-based rates, including inflation
expectations. Any adverse effect of inflation on the Company s results of operations has not been
substantial.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 

General 

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company s competitive wholesale business.
These factors include the Company s ability to achieve sales growth while containing costs. The
level of future earnings also depends on numerous factors including regulatory matters (such as
those related to affiliate contracts), creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity
available in the Southeast, the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire, and
the Company s ability to execute its acquisition strategy and to construct generating facilities.
Other factors that could influence future earnings include weather, demand, generation patterns,
and operational limitations. Recent recessionary conditions have lowered demand and have
negatively impacted capacity revenues under the Company s PPAs where the amounts purchased are
based on demand. The Company is unable to predict whether demand under these PPAs will return to
pre-recession levels. The timing and extent of the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

The Company s system generating capacity increased 325 MWs due to the acquisition of West Georgia
and divestiture of DeSoto in December 2009 as described herein. In general, the Company has
constructed or acquired new generating capacity only after entering into long-term capacity
contracts for the new facilities which are optimized by limited energy trading activities. See
 Acquisitions and Divestitures  and  Construction Projects  herein for additional information.

Power Sales Agreements 

The Company s sales are primarily through long-term PPAs. The Company is working to maintain
and expand its share of the wholesale market. The Company expects
that many areas of the market will need capacity in 2016.

The Company s PPAs consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit
or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of
the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. The Company typically has the
ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type,
referred to as requirements service, provides that the Company serve the customer s capacity
and energy requirements from a combination of the customer s own generating units and from
Company resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. The Company has rights to
purchase power provided by the requirements customers  resources when economically viable.

II-392 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The Company has entered into the following PPAs over the past three years:

(a) 
       
     Assumed contract through the West Georgia acquisition in 2009. 

(b) 
       
     Assumed contract through the Nacogdoches acquisition in 2009. Commercial
operation of Plant Nacogdoches is expected to begin in June 2012. 

(c) 
       
     This agreement is an extension of the current agreement with Seminole for
Plant Oleander. 

(d) 
       
     Power purchases under this agreement will increase over the term of the
agreement. 45 MWs will be sold from 2012 through 2016, 90 MWs will be sold
from 2017 through 2018, and 180 MWs will be sold from 2019 through 2036. 

(e) 
       
     Power to serve this agreement will be purchased under a third party
agreement for resale to EnergyUnited. The purchases will be resold at cost. 

(f) 
       
     These agreements are extensions of current agreements with 10 Georgia EMCs.
Eight agreements were extended from 2010 through 2031 and two agreements were
extended from 2013 through 2034. 

(g) 
       
     Represents average annual capacity purchases. 

(h) 
       
     This agreement is an extension of the current agreement with FMPA for Plant
Stanton. 

The Company has PPAs with some of Southern Company s traditional operating companies and
with other investor owned utilities, independent power producers, municipalities, and
electric cooperatives. Although some of the Company s PPAs are with the traditional
operating companies, the Company s generating facilities are not in the traditional operating
companies  regulated rate bases, and the Company is not able to seek recovery from the
traditional operating companies  ratepayers for construction, repair, environmental, or
maintenance costs. The Company expects that the capacity payments in the PPAs will produce
sufficient cash flow to cover costs, pay debt service, and provide an equity return.
However, the Company s overall profit will depend on numerous factors, including efficient
operation of its generating facilities and demand under the Company s PPAs.

As a general matter, existing PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for
either procuring the fuel or reimbursing the Company for the cost of fuel relating to the
energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not
meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, the Company may be responsible
for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of the Company s PPAs
provide that the counterparties are responsible for transporting the fuel to the particular
generating facility.

Fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs will be recovered through capacity
charges based on dollars-per-kilowatt year or energy charges based on dollars-per-MW hour.
In general, the Company has long-term service contracts with General Electric and Siemens AG
to reduce its exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs relating to such vendors 
applicable equipment. See Note 7 to the financial statements under  Long-Term Service
Agreements  for additional information.

II-393

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Many of the Company s PPAs have provisions that require the posting of collateral or an
acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that Standard and Poor s Rating Services, a
division of the McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. (S P) or Moody s Investors Service (Moody s)
downgrades the credit ratings of the counterparty to an unacceptable credit rating or if the
counterparty is not rated or fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. The PPAs are
expected to provide the Company with a stable source of revenue during their respective
terms.

The Company has entered into long-term power sales agreements for an average of 84% of its
available capacity for the next five years and 74% of its available capacity for the next 10
years as follows:

Environmental Matters 

The Company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning   Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to global
climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also significantly
affect the Company.

New environmental legislation or regulations, such as requirements related to greenhouse gases or
changes to existing statutes or regulations, could affect many areas of the Company s operations.
While the Company s PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with
some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations, the
full impact of any such regulatory or legislative changes cannot be determined at this time.

Because the Company s units are newer gas-fired generating facilities, costs associated with
environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly
situated coal-fired generating facilities or older gas-fired generating facilities. Environmental,
natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations,
the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding aesthetic impacts such as
increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts, can, however,
increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future electric generating facility. The
impact of such statutes and regulations on the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Global Climate Issues  

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions renewable energy standards, and energy efficiency standards continue to be considered in
Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by
the current Administration. On June 26, 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009
(ACES), which would impose mandatory greenhouse gas restrictions through implementation of a cap
and trade program, a renewable energy standard, and other measures, was passed by the House of
Representatives. ACES would require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions on a national basis to
a level that is 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, and 83% below 2005
levels by 2050. In addition, ACES would provide for renewable energy standards of 6% by 2012 and
20% by 2020. Similar legislation is being considered by the Senate. The financial and operational
impact of such legislation, if enacted, will depend on a variety of factors. These factors include
the specific greenhouse gas emissions limits or renewable energy requirements, the timing of
implementation of these limits or requirements, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the
level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and
commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions,
the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any),
the impact on natural gas prices, and cost recovery through PPAs. There can be no assurance that
any legislation will be enacted or as to the ultimate form of any legislation. Additional or
alternative legislation may be adopted as well.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. On
December 15, 2009, the EPA published a final determination, which became effective on January 14,
2010, that certain greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles endanger public health and
welfare due to climate change. On September 28, 2009, the EPA published a proposed rule regulating
greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has stated that
once this rule is effective, it will cause carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to become
regulated pollutants under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) preconstruction permit
program and the Title V operating permit program, which both apply to power plants. As a result,
the construction of new facilities or the major modification of existing facilities could trigger
the requirement for a PSD permit and the installation of the best available control technology for
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The EPA also published a proposed rule governing how
these programs would be applied to stationary sources, including power plants, on October 27, 2009.
The EPA has stated that it expects to finalize these proposed rules in March 2010. The ultimate
outcome of the endangerment finding and these proposed rules cannot be determined at this time and
will depend on additional regulatory action and any legal challenges.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. A nonbinding agreement was announced during the most recent round of
negotiations in December 2009 that included a pledge from both developed and developing countries
to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome and impact of the international negotiations
cannot be determined at this time.

Although the outcome of federal, state, or international initiatives cannot be determined at this
time, mandatory restrictions on the Company s greenhouse gas emissions or requirements relating to
renewable energy or energy efficiency on the federal or state level are likely to result in
significant additional compliance costs, including significant capital expenditures. Also,
additional compliance costs could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition
if such costs are not recovered through PPAs. Further, higher costs that are recovered through
regulated rates at other utilities could contribute to an overall reduction in  demand for electricity, which could negatively impact
 the Company s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In 2008, the total carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel-fired electric generating units
owned by the Company were approximately 6 million metric tons. The preliminary estimate of carbon
dioxide emissions from these units in 2009 is approximately
7 million metric tons. The level of
carbon dioxide emissions from year to year will be dependent on the level of generation, which is
determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating
units.

The Company continues to evaluate its future energy and emissions profiles and is participating in
voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help develop and advance technology to
reduce emissions, including the construction of a biomass plant in Sacul, Texas.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation  

Kivalina Case 

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled that the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and
by the plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct
caused the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Other Litigation 

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations  

In February 2004, the EPA finalized the Industrial Boiler (IB) MACT rule, which imposed limits on
hazardous air pollutants from industrial boilers, including biomass boilers. Compliance with the
final rule was scheduled to begin in September 2007; however, in response to challenges to the
final rule, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the IB MACT rule
in its entirety in July 2007 and ordered the EPA to develop a new IB MACT rule. In September 2009,
the deadline to promulgate a proposed rule was extended from July 15, 2009 to April 15, 2010, with
a final rule required by December 16, 2010. The EPA is currently developing the new rule and may
change the methodology to determine the MACT limits for industrial boilers.

Income Tax Matters 

Legislation  

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives. The Company estimates the cash flow reduction to 2009 tax
payments as a result of the bonus depreciation provisions of the ARRA to be immaterial. The
Company is receiving investment tax credits (ITCs) under the renewable energy incentives related to
the Nacogdoches biomass facility which will have a material impact on cash flows and net income.
On December 8, 2009, President Obama announced proposals to accelerate job growth that include an
extension of the bonus depreciation provision for the ARRA for 2010, which could have a significant
impact on the future cash flow and net income of the Company. The Company is currently assessing
the other financial implications of the ARRA.

The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction  

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as
defined in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code. The deduction is equal to a stated percentage
of qualified production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005
through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the
years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. See Note 5 to the financial statements under
 Effective Tax Rate  for additional information.

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

Nacogdoches Acquisition  

On October 8, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of Nacogdoches
from American Renewables LLC, the original developer of the project, for approximately $50.1
million in cash consideration. Nacogdoches is constructing a biomass generating plant in Sacul,
Texas with an estimated capacity of 100 MWs. The generating plant will be fueled from wood waste.
Construction commenced in 2009 and the plant is expected to begin commercial operation in 2012.
Costs incurred through December 31, 2009 were $86.6 million. The total estimated cost of the
project is expected to be between $475 million and $500 million. The output of the plant is
contracted under a PPA with Austin Energy that begins in 2012 and expires in 2032 or until a
contractual limit of $2.3 billion in billings is reached. See Note 2 to the financial statements
under  Acquisitions and Divestitures  Nacogdoches Power LLC Acquisition  for additional
information.

West Georgia Acquisition and Plant DeSoto Divestiture  

On December 17, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of West
Georgia from Broadway, an affiliate of LS Power. The acquisition agreement provided for the
transfer of all the outstanding membership interests of DeSoto from the Company to Broadway and the
payment by the Company of approximately $144.0 million in cash consideration. West Georgia was
merged into the Company and the Company now owns a 669-MW nameplate capacity generating facility
consisting of four combustion turbine natural gas generating units with oil back-up. The output
from two units is contracted under PPAs with MEAG Power and GEC. The MEAG Power agreement began in
2009 and expires in 2029. The GEC agreement begins in 2010 and expires in 2030. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under  Acquisitions and Divestitures   West Georgia Generating Company, LLC
Acquisition and DeSoto County Generating Company, LLC Divestiture  for additional information.

Construction Projects 

Cleveland County Units 1-4  

In December 2008, the Company announced that it will build an electric generating plant in
Cleveland County, North Carolina. The plant will consist of four combustion turbine natural gas
generating units with a total generating capacity of 720 MWs. The units are expected to begin
commercial operation in 2012. Costs incurred through December 31, 2009 were $62.7 million. The
total estimated construction cost is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million, which is
included in the capital program estimates described under FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  
 Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations  herein.

The Company has also entered into PPAs with NCEMC and NCMPA1 for a portion of the generating
capacity from the plant that will begin in 2012 and expire in 2036 and 2031, respectively. NCEMC
will purchase 180 MWs of capacity that will be supported by one unit at the plant and will purchase
capacity from a second unit at the plant that will increase to 180 MWs over a seven-year phase-in
period. NCMPA1 will purchase 180 MWs from a third unit at the plant. The NCEMC PPAs were approved
by the Rural Utilities Service on March 6, 2009.

Nacogdoches Biomass Plant  

The Company is currently constructing a biomass plant in Sacul, Texas. See  Acquisitions and
Divestitures   Nacogdoches Acquisition  herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under
 Acquisitions and Divestitures   Nacogdoches Power LLC Acquisition  for additional information.

Other Matters 

The Company completed depreciation studies in 2008 and 2009. The composite depreciation rates for
its property, plant, and equipment were updated in these studies. These changes in estimates arise
from changes in useful life assumptions for certain components of plant in service. These changes
increased depreciation expense prospectively beginning January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2009 and
reduced net income. The net income impacts of these changes were $2.8 million and $3.1 million in
2008 and 2009, respectively. See Note 1 to the financial statements under  Depreciation  for
additional information. The Company reviews its estimated useful lives and salvage values on an
ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could have a material impact on net income in the near
term. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  herein
for additional information.

From time to time, the Company is involved in various matters being litigated and regulatory
matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims
and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company s business activities
are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property and other
damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements
such as air and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In
particular, personal injury and other claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
materials, and common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly
caused by greenhouse gas and other emissions, have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of
such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however,
for current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the
liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on
the Company s financial statements. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information
regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that
may have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the
critical accounting policies and estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern
Company s Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition  

The Company s revenue recognition depends on appropriate classification and documentation of
transactions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In general, the
Company s power sale transactions can be classified in one of four categories: non-derivatives,
normal sales, cash flow hedges, and mark to market. For more information on derivative
transactions, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY    Market Price Risk  herein and Notes 1 and 9
to the financial statements. The Company s revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used
to determine the appropriate transaction classification, which must be documented upon the
inception of each contract.
 Factors that must be considered in making these determinations include:

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a lease; 

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a derivative; 

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a capacity contract; 

Assessing the probability at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract
that the contract will result in physical delivery; 

Ensuring that the contract quantities do not exceed available generating capacity (including
purchased capacity); 

Identifying the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, and the nature of the risk being
hedged; and 

Assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and throughout the contract term 

Normal Sale and Non-Derivative Transactions 

The Company has entered into capacity contracts that provide for the sale of electricity and that
involve physical delivery in quantities within the Company s available generating capacity. These
contracts either do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales, thus
exempting them from fair value accounting in accordance with GAAP. As a result, such transactions
are accounted for as executory contracts; additionally, the related revenue is recognized on an
accrual basis in amounts equal to the lesser of the cumulative levelized amount or the cumulative
amount billable under the contract over the respective contract periods. Revenues are recorded on
a gross or net basis in accordance with GAAP. Contracts recorded on the accrual basis represented
the majority of the Company s operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Cash Flow Hedge Transactions 

The Company designates other derivative contracts for the sale of electricity as cash flow hedges
of anticipated sale transactions. These contracts are marked to market through other comprehensive
income over the life of the contract. Realized gains and losses are then recognized in revenues as
incurred.

Mark-to-Market Transactions 

Contracts for sales and purchases of electricity, which meet the definition of a derivative and
that are not designated as normal sales and purchases or designated as cash flow hedges, are marked
to market and recorded directly through net income. Net unrealized gains (losses) on such
contracts recognized in wholesale revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
$5.3 million and $(1.9) million, respectively. Mark-to-market transactions were immaterial in
2007.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Percentage of Completion  

The Company is currently engaged in a long-term contract for engineering, procurement, and
construction services to build a combined cycle unit for the OUC. Construction activities
commenced in 2006 and were substantially completed in 2009. Billings and costs are recognized
using the percentage of completion method. The Company utilizes the cost-to-cost approach as this
method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. The percentage of
completion represents the percentage of the total costs incurred to the estimated total cost of the
contract. Billings and costs are recognized on a net basis in other income (expense) by applying
this percentage to the total billings and estimated costs of the contract.

Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Intangibles  

The Company s investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets, whether in service
or under construction. The Company s intangible assets consist of acquired PPAs that are amortized
over the term of the PPAs and goodwill resulting from acquisitions. The Company evaluates the
carrying value of these assets in accordance with accounting standards whenever indicators of
potential impairment exist, or annually in the case of goodwill. Examples of impairment indicators
could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a
history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices,
and the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period. If an indicator exists,
the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the
undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset. A high degree of
judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on
projections of various factors, including the following:

Future demand for electricity based on projections of economic growth and estimates of
available generating capacity; 

Future power and natural gas prices, which have been quite volatile in recent years; and 

Future operating costs. 

Acquisition Accounting  

The Company has been engaged in a strategy of acquiring assets. The Company has accounted for
these acquisitions under the purchase method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the Company has
included these operations in the consolidated financial statements from the respective date of
acquisition. The purchase price of each acquisition was allocated to the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by the Company
for successful or potential acquisitions after December 31, 2008 have been expensed as incurred.

Contingent Obligations  

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with accounting standards, records reserves for those
matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable and records a
tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained. The
adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be
unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the Company s
financial statements.

These events or conditions include the following:

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having jurisdiction
over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and
other environmental matters. 

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
or state revenue department interpretations of existing regulations. 

Identification of sites that require environmental remediation or the filing of other
complaints in which the Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party. 

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or complaints in which the Company
may be named as a defendant. 

Resolution or progression of new or existing matters through the legislative process, the
court systems, the IRS, state revenue departments, the FERC, or the EPA.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Depreciation  

Depreciation of the original cost of assets is computed under the straight-line method and applies
a composite depreciation rate based on the assets  estimated useful lives determined by management.
The primary assets in property, plant, and equipment are power plants, all of which have an
estimated composite life ranging from 24 to 35 years. These lives reflect a weighted average of
the significant components (retirement units) that make up the plants. The Company reviews its
estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could
result in changes which could have a material impact on net income in the near term. See Note 1 to
the financial statements under  Depreciation  for a discussion of changes in depreciation
assumptions made by the Company effective January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2009.

When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal
course of business, its cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and a
gain or loss is recognized.

Convertible Investment Tax Credits  

Under the ARRA, certain costs related to the Nacogdoches plant construction are eligible for ITCs
or cash grants. The Company has elected to receive ITCs. The credits
are recorded as a deferred credit, which will be amortized over the
life of the asset, and the tax basis of the asset is
reduced by 50% of the credits received, resulting in a deferred tax asset. The Company has elected
to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense as costs
are incurred during the construction period. This basis difference will reverse and be recorded to
income tax expense over the useful life of the asset once placed in service. The credits received
during the year will be shown within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash
flows.

New Accounting Standards 

Variable Interest Entities  

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on the consolidation of
variable interest entities, which replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for
determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an
approach that is primarily qualitative, requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requires additional disclosures about an
enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities. The Company adopted this new guidance
effective January 1, 2010 with no material impact on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

Overview 

The Company s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2009. The Company has
successfully accessed the commercial paper market as needed during 2009. There was $118.9 million
of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The Company intends to continue
to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit
arrangements as needed to meet its future capital and liquidity needs. Market rates for committed
credit have increased and the Company may be subject to higher costs as its existing facilities are
replaced or renewed. See  Sources of Capital  herein for additional information on lines of
credit.

Net cash
provided from operating activities totaled $318.1 million in
2009, increasing 20.4% from
2008. This increase is primarily due to a reduction in costs incurred on the OUC construction
contract, receipt of convertible investment tax credits, and timing of tax payments. Net cash used for investing
activities totaled $364.1 million
in 2009, increasing 324.5% from 2008. This increase was primarily due to the Nacogdoches and West
Georgia acquisitions in October 2009 and December 2009, respectively. Gross property additions to
utility plant of $137.1 million in 2009 were primarily related to the construction of the Cleveland
County and Nacogdoches facilities. Net cash provided from financing activities was $15.2 million
in 2009, compared to $140.6 million used in 2008. This change was primarily due to the issuance of
short-term debt in 2009.

II-400 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $264.3 million in 2008, decreasing 16.2% from
2007. This decrease is primarily due to cash outflows for engineering, procurement, and
construction services to build a combined cycle unit for the OUC. Net cash used for investing
activities totaled $85.8 million in 2008, decreasing 53.4% from 2007. This decrease was primarily
due to the completion of Plant Oleander Unit 5 in 2007 and the completion of Plant Franklin Unit 3
in 2008. Gross property additions to utility plant of $50.0 million in 2008 were primarily related
to the completion of Plant Franklin Unit 3. Net cash used for financing activities was $140.6
million in 2008, decreasing 12.9% from 2007. This decrease was primarily due to reduced levels of
short-term debt in 2008.

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $315.4 million in 2007, increasing 29.8% from
2006. This increase was primarily due to the increase in sales due to favorable weather and cash
received under billings for the engineering, procurement, and construction services to build a
combined cycle unit for the OUC. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $183.9 million in
2007, decreasing 61% from 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of Plants
DeSoto and Rowan in June 2006 and September 2006, respectively. Gross property additions to
utility plant of $139.2 million in 2007 were primarily related to the on-going construction
activity at Plant Franklin Unit 3 and the completion of construction at Plant Oleander Unit 5. Net
cash used for financing activities was $161.5 million in 2007 compared to $233.4 million provided
to the Company in 2006. This change was primarily due to the cash proceeds of $200 million from
the issuance of 30-year senior notes in 2006 and borrowings and equity contributions to finance the
acquisitions of Plants DeSoto and Rowan.

Significant asset changes in the balance sheet during 2009 include increases related to the West
Georgia and Nacogdoches acquisitions. Construction work in progress increased due to Cleveland
County and Nacogdoches construction activities. Prepaid long-term service agreements increased due
to the timing of outage activities. Additionally, prepaid income taxes decreased due to the timing
of income tax payments. Cash decreased due to the West Georgia and Nacogdoches acquisitions and
increased construction activity.

Significant asset changes in the balance sheet during 2008 include increases in accounts receivable
related to higher energy revenues due to an increase in natural gas prices, increases in prepaid
long-term service agreements due to the timing of outage activities, and an increase in cash due to
a reduction of investing activities of the Company in 2008 due to the completion of construction
projects at Plant Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007 and Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008.

Significant liability and stockholder s equity changes in the balance sheet during 2009 include the
issuance of $118.9 million in notes payable, an increase in accounts payable related to
construction projects, and a decrease in net billings in excess of cost due to the timing of
scheduled payments and costs incurred with regard to the OUC construction contract. In 2009, the
Company also paid $106.1 million in dividends to Southern Company.

Significant liability and stockholder s equity changes in the balance sheet during 2008 include the
payment of short-term debt obligations, increases in affiliate payables due to increases in natural
gas and purchased power prices, a reduction of other current liabilities due to payment of IGCC
termination costs, and a decrease in the net billings in excess of cost on the OUC construction
contract due to on-going construction activities. In 2008, the Company also paid $94.5 million in
dividends to Southern Company.

Sources of Capital 

The Company may use operating cash flows, external funds, or equity capital or loans from Southern
Company to finance any new projects, acquisitions, and ongoing capital requirements. The Company
expects to generate external funds from the issuance of unsecured senior debt and commercial paper
or utilization of credit arrangements from banks. However, the amount, type, and timing of any
financings, if needed, will depend upon regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions, and
other factors.

The Company s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets due to the use of short-term
indebtedness as a funding source, as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to
the seasonality of the business. To meet liquidity and capital resource requirements, at
December 31, 2009, the Company had $400 million of committed credit arrangements with banks that
expire in 2012. There were no borrowings under this facility outstanding at December 31, 2009.
Proceeds from these credit arrangements may be used for working capital and general corporate
purposes as well as liquidity support for the Company s commercial paper program. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information.

II-401 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The Company s commercial paper program is used to finance acquisition and construction costs
related to electric generating facilities and for general corporate purposes. At December 31,
2009, there was $118.9 million of commercial paper outstanding. See Note 6 to the financial
statements under  Bank Credit Arrangements  for additional information.

Management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing cash
balances, commercial paper programs, and lines of credit.

Financing Activities 

During 2009 and 2008, the Company did not issue any new long-term securities.

The issuance of all securities by the Company is generally subject to regulatory approval by the
FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files
registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the FERC, as well as the
amounts registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made
to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Credit Rating Risk 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB and Baa2, or BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity
purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, and energy price risk
management. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these
contracts at a BBB and Baa2 rating were approximately $9 million and at a BBB- and/or Baa3 rating
were approximately $339 million. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential collateral
requirements under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately $984
million. Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the
event that one or more power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment
grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or
cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the Company s ability to access
capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

In addition, through the acquisition of Plant Rowan, the Company assumed PPAs with Duke Energy and
NCMPA1 that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of
the Company s credit. The Duke Energy PPA defines the downgrade to be below BBB- or Baa3. The
NCMPA1 PPA requires credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of
collateral required would depend upon actual losses, if any, resulting from a credit downgrade for
both PPAs.

Market Price Risk 

The Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain energy-related
commodity prices, and, occasionally, currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company takes advantage of natural offsets and enters into
various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company s policies in
areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is that derivatives are
to be used primarily for hedging purposes. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
that include market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no variable long-term debt outstanding. Therefore, there
would be no effect on annualized interest expense related to long-term debt if the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Since a significant portion of outstanding
indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates, the Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances
that would significantly affect such exposures in the near term. However, the impact on future
financing costs cannot be determined at this time.

Because energy from the Company s facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling
agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the
counterparties, the Company s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity is limited. However, the Company has been and may continue to be exposed to market
volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of sales of uncontracted generating
capacity.

     Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered
into during the period, if any. 

The decreases in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were $6.9 million and $0.0 million,
respectively, which is due to both volume and price changes in power and natural gas positions.

At December 31, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge designation was
reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives used by the Company to hedge anticipated purchases
and sales are initially deferred in other comprehensive income before being recognized in income in
the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Total net unrealized pre-tax gains (losses) recognized in the statements of income for the years
ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 for energy-related derivative contracts that are not
hedges were $(5.2) million and $0.9 million, respectively.

II-403 

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)  
 Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy
in which they fall at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

The Company uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using
prices which are actively quoted, and thus fall into Level 2. See Note 8 to the financial
statements for further discussion on fair value measurements.

The Company is exposed to market-price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
energy-related derivative contracts. The Company s policy is to enter into derivative agreements
with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by S P and Moody s or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For
additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under  Financial Instruments. 

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 

The capital program of the Company is currently estimated to be $627.4 million for 2010,
$856.5 million for 2011, and $379.0 million for 2012. These amounts include estimates for
potential plant acquisitions and new construction as well as ongoing capital improvements. Planned
expenditures for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the Company s ability
to execute its growth strategy. Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of
changes in factors such as: business conditions; environmental statutes and regulations; FERC rules
and regulations; load projections; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction
labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. The
Company is currently constructing four combustion turbine units in North Carolina and a biomass
generating facility in Texas. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL    Construction Projects  herein and
Note 2 to the financial statements under  Acquisitions and
Divestitures   Nacogdoches Power LLC
Acquisition  for additional information.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt, as well as the related interest, leases, derivative obligations, and other purchase
commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, 7, and 9 to the financial statements for additional
information.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

The Company s 2009 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
include, among other things, statements concerning environmental regulations and expenditures,
financing activities, access to sources of capital, impacts of the adoption of new accounting
rules, impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, estimated sales and
purchases under new power sale and purchase agreements, impacts of revisions to depreciation

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

General 

Southern Power Company (the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is
also the parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Company Services, Inc.
(SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Holdings,
Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other
direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating companies, Alabama Power Company
(APC), Georgia Power Company (GPC), Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power), and Mississippi Power Company,
are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in four Southeastern states. The
Company constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at
market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost,
specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless
provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies
and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber cable services within the
Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for Southern Company s
investments in leveraged leases. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
Company s nuclear power plants.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The
Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.
Certain prior years  data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Southern Company   Florida LLC, Oleander Power Project, LP (Oleander), Southern Power Company  
Orlando Gasification LLC (SPC-OG), and Nacogdoches Power LLC, which own, operate, and maintain the
Company s ownership interests in Plant Stanton Unit A and Plant Oleander, construct the combined
cycle for the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC), and construct a biomass generating facility,
respectively. See Note 2 under  Nacogdoches Power LLC Acquisition.  All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Affiliate Transactions 

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at amounts in compliance with FERC regulation: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing,
auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital
wireless communications, labor, and other services with respect to business and operations and
Southern Company system fleet of generating units (power pool) transactions. Because the Company
has no employees, all employee-related charges are rendered at amounts in compliance with FERC
regulation under agreements with SCS. Costs for these services from SCS amounted to approximately
$133.0 million in 2009, $207.4 million in 2008, and $125.4 million in 2007. Approximately $83.1
million in 2009, $87.9 million in 2008, and $74.1 million in 2007 were operations and maintenance
expenses; the remainder was recorded to construction work in progress, other assets, and billings
in excess of cost on construction contract. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC
permits services to be rendered at cost by system service companies.

In 2003, the Company entered into agreements with APC and GPC under which APC and GPC operated and
maintained Plants Dahlberg, Wansley, Franklin, and Harris. GPC also supplied various services for
other plants. In August 2007, those agreements were terminated and replaced with service
agreements under which APC and GPC provide specifically requested services to the Company. These
services are billed at amounts in compliance with FERC regulation on a monthly basis and are
recorded as operations and maintenance expenses in the consolidated statements of income. For the
periods ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, billings under these agreements totaled
approximately $1.4 million, $2.9 million, and $9.2 million, respectively.

Total billings for all purchased power agreements (PPAs) in effect with affiliates totaled $485.1
million, $539.6 million, and $505.2 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Included in
these billings were $36.4 million and $32.2 million of  Deferred capacity revenues   affiliated 
recorded on the balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company and the
traditional operating companies may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural
gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating
company may be jointly and severally liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements.

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The Company and the traditional operating companies generally settle amounts related to the above
transactions on a monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the
purchase or sale of electricity.

In 2009, there were no material transactions involving the sale of property to affiliated
companies.

In 2008, Gulf Power and APC sold turbine rotor assemblies to the Company for $9.4 million and $6.3
million, respectively. Additionally, the Company sold a turbine rotor assembly to APC for $8.2
million and sold a compressor assembly to GPC for $3.9 million. No gain or loss was recognized in
the Company s consolidated statements of income. These affiliate transactions were made in
accordance with FERC and state Public Service Commission (PSC) rules and guidelines.

In 2007, the Company sold plots of land in Prattville, Alabama and Chilton County, Alabama to APC.
The total sales price was $4.3 million and is recorded in  Sale of property to affiliates  on the
consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, the Company sold a turbine rotor to Gulf Power
for $7.9 million. No gain or loss was recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of
income. These affiliate transactions were made in accordance with FERC and state PSC rules and
guidelines.

Acquisition Accounting 

The Company has been engaged in a strategy of acquiring assets. The Company has accounted for
these acquisitions under the purchase method in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP). Accordingly, the Company has included these operations in the consolidated
financial statements from the respective date of acquisition. The purchase price of each
acquisition was allocated to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Any due
diligence or transition costs incurred by the Company for successful or potential acquisitions
after December 31, 2008 have been expensed as incurred.

Revenues 

Capacity is sold at rates specified under contractual terms and is recognized at the lesser of the
levelized amount or the amount billable under the contract over the respective contract periods.
Energy is generally sold at market-based rates and the associated revenue is recognized as the
energy is delivered. Transmission revenues and other fees are recognized as incurred as other
operating revenue. Revenues are recorded on a gross basis for all full requirements PPAs. See
 Financial Instruments  for additional information.

Significant portions of the Company s revenues have been derived from certain customers pursuant to
PPAs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, GPC accounted for 43.7% of total revenues, APC
accounted for 6.6% of total revenues, and Sawnee Electric Membership Corporation accounted for 6.0%
of total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2008, GPC accounted for 36.5% of total
revenues, Sawnee Electric Membership Corporation accounted for 6.1% of total revenues, and Flint
Electric Membership Corporation accounted for 5.3% of total revenues. For the year ended December
31, 2007, GPC accounted for 45.6% of total revenues, APC accounted for 6.9% of total revenues, and
Sawnee Electric Membership Corporation accounted for 5.5% of total revenues.

Fuel Costs 

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is consumed. Fuel costs also include emissions allowances
which are expensed as the emissions occur.

Income and Other Taxes 

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. In accordance with accounting
standards related to the uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognizes tax positions that are
 more likely than not  of being sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities.
See Note 5 under  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  for additional information.

Convertible
Investment Tax Credits 

Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, certain costs related to the Nacogdoches
plant construction are eligible for investment tax credits (ITCs) or cash grants. The Company has
elected to receive ITCs. The credits are recorded as a deferred
credit, which will be amortized over the life of the asset, and the tax basis

II-414 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

of the
asset is reduced by 50% of the credits received, resulting in a deferred
tax asset. The Company has elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a
reduction to income tax expense as costs are incurred during the construction period. This basis
difference will reverse and be recorded to income tax expense over the useful life of the asset
once placed in service. The credits received during the year will be
shown within operating
activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

The Company s depreciable property, plant, and equipment consists entirely of generation assets.

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost includes materials,
direct labor incurred by contractors and affiliated companies, minor items of property, and
interest capitalized. Interest is capitalized on qualifying projects during the development and
construction period. The cost to replace significant items of property defined as retirement units
is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is
charged to maintenance expense as incurred.

Depreciation 

Depreciation of the original cost of assets is computed under the straight-line method and applies
a composite depreciation rate based on the assets  estimated useful lives determined by the
Company. The primary assets in property, plant, and equipment are power plants, all of which have
an estimated composite depreciable life ranging from 24-35 years. These lives reflect a composite
of the significant components (retirement units) that make up the plants. The Company reviews its
estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could
result in changes which could have a material impact on net income in the near term.

A depreciation study was completed and the applicable remaining plant lives and associated
depreciation rates were revised in January 2008 and January 2009. This change in estimate was due
to revised useful life assumptions for certain components of plant in service. Depreciation rates
by generating facility changed from a range of 2.8% to 3.8% to an adjusted range of 1.8% to 4.1%
in January 2008. Depreciation rates by generating facility changed to an adjusted range of 1.9% to
5.6% in January 2009. These changes increased depreciation and reduced income from continuing
operations and net income by $4.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for 2008 and $5.1 million
and $3.1 million, respectively, for 2009.

When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal
course of business, its cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and a
gain or loss is recognized.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal 

The present value of the ultimate costs for an asset s future retirement is recorded in the period
in which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived
asset and depreciated over the asset s useful life.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no material liability for asset retirement obligations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles 

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangibles for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The
Company s intangible assets consist of acquired PPAs that are amortized over the term of the PPA
and goodwill resulting from acquisitions. The average term of the PPAs is 20 years. The
determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future
cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If
impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the
fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value.
Impairment of goodwill is assessed on an annual basis. For assets identified as held for sale,
the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to
determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated
fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

II-415 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The amortization expense for the PPAs is as follows:

Deferred Project Development Costs 

The Company capitalizes project development costs once it is determined that it is probable that a
specific site will be acquired and a power plant constructed. These costs include professional
services, permits, and other costs directly related to the construction of a new project. These
costs are generally transferred to construction work in progress upon commencement of construction.
The total deferred project development costs were $9.0 million at December 31, 2009, $8.9 million
at December 31, 2008, and $8.4 million at December 31, 2007.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies 

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of generating plant materials.
Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as
appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory 

Fuel inventory includes the cost of oil and emissions allowances. The Company maintains minimal
oil levels for use at Plant Dahlberg, Plant Oleander, Plant Rowan, and Plant West Georgia.
Inventory is maintained using the weighted average cost method. Fuel inventory and emissions
allowances are recorded at actual cost when purchased and then expensed at weighted average cost as
used.

Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (included in  Other  or shown
separately as  Risk Management Activities ) and are measured at fair value. See Note 8 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are excluded from fair value accounting
requirements because they qualify and are designated for the  normal  scope exception, and are
accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of
anticipated transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized
currently in net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period
income and are recorded in the financial statement line item where they will eventually settle.
See Note 9 for additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2009.

II-416 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties 
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2). See Note 8 for all other items recognized at fair value in the
financial statements.

Other Income and (Expense) 

Other income and (expense) includes non-operating revenues and expenses. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred.

The Company has a long-term contract for engineering, procurement, and construction services to
build a combined cycle unit for the OUC. Construction activities commenced in 2006 and were
substantially completed in 2009. Billings and costs are recognized using the percentage of
completion method. The Company utilizes the cost-to-cost approach as this method is less
subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. The percentage of completion
represents the percentage of the total costs incurred to the estimated total cost of the contract.
Billings and costs are recognized on a net basis by applying this percentage to the total revenues
and estimated costs of the contract and are recorded in other income and (expense) in the
consolidated statements of income. Net profit recognized under the long-term construction contract
for the OUC was $13.3 million in 2009. No profit or loss was recognized in 2008 or 2007.

In 2008, the Company received a fee of $6.4 million for participating in an asset auction. The
Company was not the successful bidder in the asset auction.

Interest related to the construction of new facilities is capitalized in accordance with GAAP.

Comprehensive Income 

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications of amounts included in net income.

2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 

Nacogdoches Power LLC Acquisition 

On October 8, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of Nacogdoches
Power LLC (Nacogdoches) from American Renewables LLC, the original developer of the project. The
Company is constructing a biomass generating plant in Sacul, Texas with an estimated capacity of
100 megawatts (MWs). The generating plant will be fueled from wood waste. Construction commenced
in late 2009 and the plant is expected to begin commercial operation in 2012. The total estimated
cost of the project is expected to be between $475 million and $500 million. The output of the
plant is contracted under a PPA with Austin Energy that begins in 2012 and expires in 2032 or until
a contractual limit of $2.3 billion is reached. This PPA will be accounted for as an operating
lease.

The Company s acquisition of the interests in Nacogdoches included cash consideration of
approximately $50.1 million. The Nacogdoches acquisition is in accordance with the Company s
overall growth strategy. There are no contingent consideration arrangements and no significant
assets or liabilities arising from contingencies. No goodwill was recorded as a result of this
acquisition. An intangible asset related to the assumed PPA with Austin Energy was recognized.
Due diligence and transition costs for Nacogdoches were expensed as incurred and were not material.
The fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of each major class of assets
and liabilities at the acquisition date was as follows:

II-417 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

West Georgia Generating Company, LLC Acquisition and DeSoto County Generating Company, LLC
Divestiture 

On December 17, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of West
Georgia Generating Company, LLC (West Georgia) from Broadway Gen Funding, LLC (Broadway), an
affiliate of LS Power. West Georgia was merged into the Company and the Company now owns a 669-MW
nameplate capacity generating facility consisting of four combustion turbine natural gas generating
units with oil back-up. The output from two units is contracted under PPAs with the Municipal
Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power) and the Georgia Energy Cooperative, Inc. (GEC). The
MEAG Power agreement began in 2009 and expires in 2029. The GEC agreement begins in 2010 and
expires in 2030.

The Company s acquisition of the interests in West Georgia was pursuant to an agreement which
included the transfer of all the outstanding membership interests of DeSoto County Generating
Company LLC (DeSoto) from the Company to Broadway and the payment by the Company of $144.0 million
in cash consideration. The carrying values of the major classes of assets disposed of were $2.0
million in fossil fuel stock, $1.2 million in materials and
supplies, $72.1 million in property,
plant and equipment, and $0.8 million in other deferred assets. The transaction was treated as a
like-kind exchange for income tax purposes. The West Georgia acquisition is in accordance with the
Company s overall growth strategy. There are no contingent consideration arrangements and no
significant assets or liabilities arising from contingencies. The goodwill arising from the
acquisition consists largely of synergies and economies of scale from combining the operations of
the Company and West Georgia and is expected to be tax deductible. Due diligence and transition
costs for West Georgia were expensed as incurred and were not material.

The fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of each major class of assets
and liabilities at the acquisition date was as follows:

Fair value amounts allocated to materials and supplies and other assets are preliminary estimates
pending final application of the Company s accounting policies.

Revenues and expenses recognized by the Company for West Georgia operations after the closing date
were not material. PPA amortization expense for 2009 was not material.

Pro Forma Information 

The following unaudited pro forma financial information gives effect to the Nacogdoches
acquisition, the West Georgia acquisition, and the DeSoto divestiture as if they had occurred as of
the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma financial information is not intended to
represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the
Company that would have been reported had the acquisitions and divestiture been completed as of the
dates presented nor should the information be taken as representative of any future consolidated
results of operations or financial condition of the Company.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

General Litigation Matters 

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property and other damage, personal injury, common law nuisance,
and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality
standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
and other claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and common law
nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse gas and
other emissions, have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential
litigation against the Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for
current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the
liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on
the Company s financial statements.

FERC Matters 

Market-Based Rate Authority  

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company s generation market
power within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets was not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by any subsidiary of
Southern Company in Southern Company s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month
refund period that ended in May 2006 could have been subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

On December 23, 2009, Southern Company and the FERC trial staff reached an agreement in principle
that would resolve the proceeding in its entirety. The agreement does not reflect any finding or
suggestion that the Company possessed or has exercised any market power. The agreement likewise
does not require the Company to make any refunds related to sales during the 15-month refund
period. Under the agreement, the Company will donate $0.2 million to nonprofit organizations in
the States of Alabama and Georgia for the purpose of offsetting the electricity bills of low-income
retail customers. The agreement is subject to review and approval by the FERC.

Intercompany Interchange Contract  

The majority of the Company s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange
Contract (IIC), as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to
examine (1) the provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies, the Company, and
SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated, (2) whether
any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC s standards of conduct applicable to utility
companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company s code of conduct
defining the Company as a  system company  rather than a  marketing affiliate  is just and
reasonable. In connection with the formation of the Company, the FERC authorized the Company s
inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company s code of
conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement s terms.
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of the Company. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. In December 2008, the FERC division of audits issued
for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and related
matters. No comments were submitted challenging the audit report s findings of Southern Company s
compliance. The proceeding remains open pending a decision from the FERC regarding the audit
report.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation 

Kivalina Case  

In February, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that some of the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly
and severally liable for the plaintiffs  damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values
and for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million.
Southern Company believes that these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. On September 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California granted the defendants  motions to dismiss the case based on
lack of jurisdiction and ruled the claims were barred by the political question doctrine and by the
plaintiffs  failure to establish the standard for determining that the defendants  conduct caused
the injury alleged. On November 5, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. District
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the district court s order dismissing the case.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Litigation  

Common law nuisance claims for injunctive relief and property damage allegedly caused by greenhouse
gas emissions have become more frequent, and courts have recently determined that private parties
and states have standing to bring such claims. For example, on October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi s dismissal of private party claims against certain oil, coal, chemical, and utility
companies alleging damages as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In reversing the dismissal, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs have standing to assert their nuisance,
trespass, and negligence claims and none of these claims are barred by the political question
doctrine. The Company is not currently a party to this litigation but was named as a defendant in
an amended complaint which was rendered moot in August 2007 by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi when such court dismissed the original matter. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS 

The Company is a 65% owner of Plant Stanton A, a combined-cycle project with a nameplate capacity
of 630 MWs. The unit is co-owned by the OUC (28%), Florida Municipal Power Agency (3.5%), and
Kissimmee Utility Authority (3.5%). The Company has a service agreement with SCS whereby SCS is
responsible for the operation and maintenance of Plant Stanton A. As of December 31, 2009, $151.2
million was recorded in plant in service with associated accumulated depreciation of $19.8 million.
These amounts represent the Company s share of the total plant assets and each owner must provide
its own financing. The Company s proportionate share of Plant Stanton A s operating expense is
included in the corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income.

5. INCOME TAXES 

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined tax returns for the
State of Georgia, the State of Alabama, and the State of Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated
income tax allocation agreement, each subsidiary s current and deferred tax expense is computed on
a stand-alone basis, and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, each
company is jointly and severally liable for the tax liability.

Current and Deferred Income Taxes 

Details of income tax provisions are as follows:

The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and their respective tax bases, which give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities, are as follows:

Deferred tax liabilities are the result of property related timing differences. The transfer of
the Plant McIntosh construction project to GPC in 2004 resulted in a deferred gain for federal
income tax purposes. GPC is reimbursing the Company for the related tax liability balance of $3.9
million. Of this total, $0.4 million is included in the balance sheets in  Receivables  
Affiliated companies  and the remainder is included in  Other deferred charges and assets  
affiliated. 

Deferred tax assets consist primarily of timing differences related to the recognition of capacity
revenues and the deferred loss on interest rate swaps reflected in other comprehensive income. The
transfer of Plants Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin to the Company from GPC in 2001 also resulted in
a deferred gain for federal income tax purposes. The Company will reimburse GPC for the related
tax asset of $6.7 million. Of this total, $1.0 million is included in the balance sheets in
 Accounts payable   Affiliated  and the remainder is included in  Other deferred credits and
liabilities   affiliated.

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Effective Tax Rate 

A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows:

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Section
199 (production activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified
production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010
with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for the years 2007
through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for
calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company reached an agreement with the IRS on a
calculation methodology and signed a closing agreement in December 2008. Therefore, in 2008, the
Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit related to the calculation methodology and adjusted
the deduction for all previous years to conform to the agreement which resulted in a decrease in
the 2008 deduction when compared to the 2007 deduction. Certain aspects of the production
activities deduction remain unresolved. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax
benefits combined with the application of the new methodology had no material effect on the
Company s financial statements.

Convertible ITCs received in 2009 for the construction of Plant Nacogdoches were $16.8 million; the tax benefit
of the basis difference reduced income tax expense by $2.9 million. See Note 1 under  Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies   Convertible Investment Tax Credits  for additional information.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

For 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased $0.4 million, resulting in a
balance of $0.1 million as of December 31, 2009.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

The tax positions from the current periods increase for 2009 relate primarily to the production
activities deduction tax position and other miscellaneous uncertain tax positions. The tax positions decrease from prior periods for 2009 relates primarily to the production activities deduction tax position. See  Effective Tax Rate  above for additional information.

Impact on the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized, is as follows:

II-422 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Accrued interest for unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

The Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The Company did not
accrue any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to a majority of
the Company s unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. The
possible conclusion or settlement of state audits could impact the balances significantly. At this
time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be determined.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2006.

6. FINANCING 

Senior Notes 

In 2009 and 2008, the Company did not issue any long-term debt securities. Long-term debt
outstanding was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Bank Credit Arrangements 

The Company has a $400 million unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (Facility) expiring
in July 2012. The purpose of the Facility is to provide liquidity support to the Company s
commercial paper program and for other general corporate purposes. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the Facility at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of the Facility. This fee is
less than  1 / 8  of 1%. In 2009 and 2008, the Company incurred approximately
$0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in expenses from commitment fees under the Facility.

The Facility contains a covenant that limits the ratio of debt to capitalization (each as defined
in the Facility) to a maximum of 65%. The Facility also contains a cross default provision that
would be triggered if the Company defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. As
of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

The Company has established a commercial paper program. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
peak commercial paper balance outstanding was $118.9 million. The average amount outstanding was
$6.6 million in 2009. The average annual interest rate was 0.4%. At December 31, 2009, the
commercial paper program had $118.9 million outstanding. At December 31, 2008, the commercial
paper program had no outstanding balances.

Dividend Restrictions 

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

The Facility and the indenture related to certain series of the Company s senior notes also contain
certain limitations on the payment of common stock dividends. No dividends may be paid unless, as
of the end of any calendar quarter, the Company s projected cash flows from fixed priced capacity
PPAs are at least 80% of total projected cash flows for the next 12 months or the Company s debt to
capitalization ratio is no greater than 60%. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance
with these ratios and had no other restrictions on its ability to pay dividends.

7. COMMITMENTS 

Expansion Program 

The capital program of the Company is currently estimated to be $627.4 million for 2010, $856.5
million for 2011, and $379.0 million for 2012. These amounts include estimates for potential plant
acquisitions and new construction as well as ongoing capital improvements. Planned expenditures
for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the Company s ability to execute
its growth strategy. Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of changes in
factors such as: business conditions; environmental statutes and regulations; FERC rules and
regulations; load projections; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction
labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital.

Long-Term Service Agreements 

The Company has entered into Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric and Siemens
AG for the purpose of securing maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion turbine
generating facilities. In summary, the LTSAs provide that the vendors will perform all planned
inspections and certain unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of
all labor and materials.

Scheduled payments to the vendors, which are subject to price escalation, are made at various
intervals based on actual operating hours or number of gas turbine starts of the respective units.
Total remaining payments to the vendors under these agreements are currently estimated at $1.2
billion over the remaining term of the agreements, which may range up to 24 years. However, the
LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at the Company s and the applicable vendor s option.
In the event of cancellation prior to scheduled work being performed, the Company is entitled to a
refund of amounts paid as calculated in accordance with termination provisions of the agreements.

Payments made to the vendors prior to the performance of any planned inspections or unplanned
maintenance are recorded as a prepayment in current assets or deferred charges and other assets on
the balance sheets and are recorded as payments pursuant to long-term service agreements in the
statements of cash flows. Inspection and maintenance costs are capitalized or charged to expense
based on the nature of the work when performed and are non-cash and are not reflected in the
statements of cash flows.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments 

SCS, as agent for the traditional operating companies and the Company, has entered into various
fuel transportation and procurement agreements to supply a portion of the fuel (primarily natural
gas) requirements for the operating facilities. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions
for firm transportation costs, storage costs, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
indices at the actual time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent estimates
based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2009. Also, the Company
has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of biomass fuel for the biomass
generating plant being constructed by the Company and for the purchase of electricity.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

(a) 
       
     Represents contractual capacity payments. 

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the Company s future needs.

II-424 

Table of Contents   

Notes (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

During 2008, the Company entered into agreements to purchase 452 MWs of power from three
counterparties. Approximately 352 MWs of these commitment obligations will be used to serve the
Company s requirements service customers. Another power purchase agreement for 100 MWs will be
resold to EnergyUnited Electric Membership Corporation (EnergyUnited) at cost for the period 2012
through 2021. The purchase power commitments for the EnergyUnited agreement are $35.4 million in
2012, $36.1 million in 2013, $36.8 million in 2014, and $279.3 million in 2015 and beyond.

In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement to purchase power of up to 200 MWs at the
discretion of the counterparty for the period 2011 through 2018. There is no contractual capacity
payment required under this agreement. Additionally, for all amounts purchased under this
arrangement, the Company will pay the counterparty an amount per MW which approximates the
Company s cost.

Acting as an agent for all of Southern Company s traditional operating companies and the Company,
SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts. Under these
agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and the Company may be jointly and
severally liable. The creditworthiness of the Company is currently inferior to the
creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies; therefore, Southern Company has entered
into keep-well agreements with each of the traditional operating companies to ensure they will not
subsidize nor be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the
inclusion of the Company as a contracting party under these agreements.

Operating Leases 

The Company has operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates. Total
operating lease expenses were $0.5 million, $0.5 million, and $0.5 million for 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively. The majority of the lease expense amounts and committed future expenditures
are with a joint owner of Plant Stanton Unit A.

At December 31, 2009, estimated minimum rental commitments for noncancelable operating leases were
as follows:

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a
market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is
maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value
measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques used for fair value measurement.

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets
or liabilities. 

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that
is either directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions
of the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
If there is little available market data, then the Company s own assumptions are the
best available information. The need to use unobservable inputs would typically apply
to long-term energy-related derivative contracts and generally results from the nature
of the energy industry, as each participant forecasts its own power supply and demand
and those of other participants, which directly impact the valuation of each unique
contract. 

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

Energy-related derivatives primarily consist of over-the-counter contracts. See Note 9 for
additional information. All of these financial instruments are valued primarily using the
market approach.

As of December 31, 2009, other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal
fair value were as follows:

9. DERIVATIVES 

The Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk. To
manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets its exposures, where
possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. The Company s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily
for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are
recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.

Energy-Related Derivatives 

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. The Company has limited exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel
prices and prices of electricity because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel
cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the Company has been and may continue to be exposed
to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of sales of uncontracted
generating capacity.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
physical fixed-price or heat rate contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the
wholesale electricity market. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in gas prices, the
Company may enter into fixed-price contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant
portion of contracts are priced at market.

Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for in one of two methods:

Cash Flow Hedges    Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges are used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other
comprehensive income (OCI) before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged
transactions are reflected in earnings. 

Not Designated    Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as
incurred. 

II-426 

Table of Contents   

NOTES (continued) 
Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2009 Annual Report 

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial
settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric industry.
When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or
loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the
actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

At December 31, 2009, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for power and natural
gas positions for the Company, together with the longest hedge date over which the Company is
hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the
longest date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

* 
       
     Includes location basis of 2 million British thermal
units (mmBtu). 

For cash flow hedges, the amounts expected to be reclassified from OCI to revenue and fuel
expense for the next 12-month period ending December 31, 2010 are losses of $1.1 million and $1.0
million, respectively.

Interest Rate Derivatives 

The Company also enters into interest rate derivatives from time to time, which include
forward-starting interest rate swaps, to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives
related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash
flow hedges, where the fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into
earnings at the same time the hedged transactions affect earnings. The derivatives employed as
hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness. At December 31, 2009, there were no
interest rate derivatives outstanding.

The estimated pre-tax loss that will be reclassified from OCI to interest expense for the next
12-month period ending December 31, 2010 is $10.7 million. The Company has deferred gains and
losses that are expected to be amortized into earnings through 2016.

derivatives and interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments on the
statements of income were as follows:

There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the pre-tax effect of energy-related
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on the statements of income were as follows:

Contingent Features 

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating
changes of certain affiliated companies. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of derivative
liabilities with contingent features was $1.7 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no collateral posted with their derivative counterparties;
however, because of the joint and several liability features underlying these derivatives, the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features,
at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, is $33.3 million.

Currently, the Company has investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to debt.

Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash.
Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that
one or more power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD A) and this Form 10-K, references to the
 Compensation Committee  are to the Compensation and Management Succession Committee of the Board
of Directors of Southern Company.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 

Southern Company, through a single executive compensation program for all officers of its
subsidiaries, drives and rewards both Southern Company financial performance and individual
business unit performance.

This executive compensation program is based on a philosophy that total executive compensation must
be competitive with the companies in our industry, must be tied to and motivate our executives to
meet our short- and long-term performance goals, must foster and encourage alignment of executive
interests with the interests of our stockholders and our customers, and must not encourage
excessive risk-taking. The program generally is designed to motivate all employees, including
executives, to achieve operational excellence and financial goals while maintaining a safe work
environment.

The executive compensation program places significant focus on rewarding performance. The program
is performance-based in several respects:

Southern Company s actual earnings per share (EPS) and Gulf Power s
business unit performance, which includes return on equity (ROE),
compared to target performance levels established early in the year,
determine actual payouts under the short-term (annual)
performance-based compensation program (Performance Pay Program). 

Southern Company common stock (Common Stock) price changes result in
higher or lower ultimate values of stock options. 

Southern Company s dividend payout and total shareholder return
compared to those of its industry peers lead to higher or lower
payouts under the Performance Dividend Program (performance
dividends). 

In support of the performance-based pay philosophy, we have no general employment contracts with
our named executive officers or guaranteed severance, except upon a change in control, and no pay
is conditioned solely upon continued employment of any of the named executive officers, other than
base salary.

The pay-for-performance principles apply not only to the named executive officers, but to hundreds
of Gulf Power employees. The Performance Pay Program covers almost all of the approximately 1,300
Gulf Power employees. Stock options and performance dividends cover approximately 250 Gulf Power
employees. These programs engage our people in our business, which ultimately is good not only for
them, but for Gulf Power s customers and Southern Company s stockholders.

OVERVIEW OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMPONENTS 

The executive compensation program is composed of several components, each of which plays a
different role. The chart below discusses the intended role of each material pay component, what
it rewards, and why we use it. Following the chart is additional information that describes how we
made 2009 pay decisions.

Retirement Benefits 

The Southern Company
Deferred Compensation Plan
provides the opportunity to defer
to future years all or part of
base salary and performance-based
compensation, except stock
options, in either a prime
interest rate  or Common
Stock account.   
Executives participate in
employee benefit plans available
to all employees of Gulf Power,
including a 401(k) savings plan
and the funded Southern Company
Pension Plan (Pension Plan).

Market practice.  
Permitting compensation deferral
is a cost-effective method of
providing additional cash flow to
Gulf Power while enhancing the
retirement savings of executives.  
The purpose of these
supplemental plans is to eliminate
the effect of tax limitations on
the payment of retirement
benefits.

Represents an important component of competitive market-based compensation in Southern Company s peer group and generally. 

Perquisites and
Other Personal

Personal financial planning
maximizes the perceived value of
our executive compensation
program to executives and allows
them to focus on Gulf Power s
operations.  
Home security systems lower
the risk of harm to executives.   
Club memberships are
provided primarily for business
use.  
Relocation benefits cover the
costs associated with geographic
relocations at the request of the
employer.  
Limited personal use of
corporate-owned aircraft
associated with business travel.

Perquisites benefit both Gulf
Power and executives, at low cost
to Gulf Power. 

Post-Termination Pay 

Change-in-control plans provide
severance pay, accelerated
vesting, and payment of short-
and long-term performance-based
compensation upon a change in
control of Gulf Power or Southern
Company coupled with involuntary
termination not for  Cause  or a
voluntary termination for  Good
Reason. 

Market practice.  
 Providing protections to senior executives upon
a change in control minimizes disruption during a
pending or anticipated change in control.  
Payment and vesting occur only upon the
occurrence of both an actual change in control and
loss of the executive s position. 

MARKET DATA 

For the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation data from large,
publicly-owned electric and gas utilities. The data was developed and analyzed by Towers Perrin,
the compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee. The companies included each
year in the primary peer group are those whose data is available through the consultant s database.
Those companies are drawn from this list of primarily regulated utilities of $2 billion in
revenues and up.

Southern Company is one of the largest U.S. utility companies based on revenues and market
capitalization, and its largest business units are some of the largest in the industry as well.
For that reason, the consultant size-adjusts the survey market data in order to fit it to the scope
of our business.

In using this market data, market is defined as the size-adjusted 50th percentile of the data, with
a focus on pay opportunities at target performance (rather than actual plan payouts). Market data
for chief executive officer positions and other positions in terms of scope of responsibilities
that most closely resemble the positions held by the named executive officers are reviewed. Based
on that data, a total target compensation opportunity is established for each named executive
officer. Total target compensation opportunity is the sum of base salary, annual performance-based
compensation at the target performance level, and stock option awards with associated performance
dividends at a target value. Actual compensation paid may be more or less than the total target
compensation opportunity based on actual performance above or below target performance levels. As
a result, the compensation program is designed to result in payouts that are market-appropriate
given Gulf Power s and Southern Company s performance for the year or period.

We did not target a specified weight for base salary or annual or long-term performance-based
compensation as a percentage of total target compensation opportunities, nor did amounts realized
or realizable from prior compensation serve to increase or decrease 2009 compensation amounts.
Total target compensation opportunities for senior management as a group are managed to be at the
median of the market for companies of our size and in our industry. The total target compensation
opportunity established in 2009 for each named executive officer is shown below.

For purposes of comparing the value of our compensation program to the market
data, stock options are valued at 5.7%, and performance dividend target at
10%, of the average daily Common Stock price for the year preceding the

III-7  

Table of Contents   

grant,
both of which represent risk-adjusted present values on the date of grant and
are consistent with the methodologies used to develop the market data. For the
2009 grant of stock options and the performance dividend target established
for the 2009-2012 performance-measurement period, this value was $4.94 per
stock option granted. In the long-term column, 36% of the value shown is
attributable to stock options and 64% is attributable to performance dividends.
The value of stock options, with the associated performance dividends, declined
from 2008. In 2008 and 2009, the value of the dividend equivalents was 10% of
the Common Stock price on the stock option grant date, but the value of the
stock option declined from 12% to 5.7%. In 2008, the performance dividends
represented 45% of the long-term target value and stock options
represented 55% of that value. More information on how stock options are valued
is reported in the Grants of Plan-Based Award table and the information
accompanying it.

As discussed above, the Compensation Committee targets total target
compensation opportunities for senior executives as a group at market.
Therefore, some executives may be paid somewhat above and others somewhat below
market. This practice allows for minor differentiation based on time in the
position, scope of responsibilities, and individual performance. The
differences in the total pay opportunities for each named executive officer are
based almost exclusively on the differences indicated by the market data for
persons holding similar positions. The average total target compensation
opportunities for the named executive officers for 2009 were at the median of
the market data described above. Because of the use of market data from a large
number of peer companies for positions that are not identical in terms of scope
of responsibility from company to company, we do not consider slight
differences material and continue to believe that our compensation program is
market-appropriate. Generally, we consider compensation to be within an
appropriate range if it is not more or less than 10% of the applicable market
data.

In 2008, the Compensation Committee received a detailed comparison of our
executive benefits program to the benefits of a group of other large utilities
and general industry companies. The results indicated that our overall
executive benefits program was at market. Because this data does not change
significantly year over year, this study is only updated every few years.

DESCRIPTION OF KEY COMPENSATION COMPONENTS 

2009 Base Salary 

The named executive officers are each within a position level with a base salary range that is
established under the direction of the Compensation Committee using the market data described
above. Consistent with the broad-based compensation program for 2009, there were no base salary
adjustments for the named executive officers.

2009 Performance-Based Compensation 

This section describes our performance-based compensation program in 2009. The Compensation
Committee approved changes to that program in 2009, to be effective in 2010. These changes are
described in the last section of this CD A entitled 2010 Executive Compensation Program Changes.

Achieving Operational and Financial Goals   Our Guiding Principle for Performance-Based
Compensation 

Our number one priority is to provide our customers outstanding reliability and superior service at
low prices while achieving a level of financial performance that benefits Southern Company s
stockholders in the short and long term.

In 2009, we strove for and rewarded:

Continued industry-leading reliability and customer satisfaction,
while maintaining our low retail prices relative to the national
average; and 

Meeting energy demand with the best economic and environmental choices. 

III-8  

Table of Contents   

In 2009, we also focused on and rewarded:

Southern Company EPS growth; 

Gulf Power ROE in the top quartile of comparable electric utilities; 

Common Stock dividend growth; 

Long-term, risk-adjusted Southern Company total shareholder return; and 

Financial Integrity   an attractive risk-adjusted return, sound
financial policy, and a stable  A  credit rating. 

The performance-based compensation program is designed to encourage Gulf Power to achieve these
goals.

The Southern Company Chief Executive Officer, with the assistance of Southern Company s Human
Resources staff, recommends to the Compensation Committee program design and award amounts for
senior executives, including the named executive officers.

2009 Annual Performance Pay Program 

Program Design 

The Performance Pay Program is Southern Company s annual performance-based compensation program.
Almost all employees of Gulf Power are participants, including the named executive officers, for a
total of over 1,300 Gulf Power participants.

The performance measured by the program uses goals set at the beginning of each year by the
Compensation Committee.

An illustration of the annual Performance Pay Program goal structure for 2009 is provided below.

Operational goals for 2009 were safety, customer
satisfaction, plant availability, transmission and
distribution system reliability, inclusion, and for
Southern Company Generation, operations and
maintenance cost performance. Each of these
operational goals is explained in more detail under
Goal Details below. The result of all operational
goals is averaged and multiplied by the bonus
impact of the EPS and business unit financial
goals. The amount for each goal can range from
0.90 to 1.10 or can be 0.00 if a threshold
performance level is not achieved as more fully
described below. The level of achievement for each
operational goal is determined and the results are
averaged. 

Southern Company EPS is weighted at 50% of the
financial goals. EPS is defined as earnings from
continuing operations divided by average shares
outstanding during the year. The EPS performance
measure is applicable to all participants in the
Performance Pay Program, including the named
executive officers. 

III-9  

Table of Contents   

Business unit financial performance is weighted at
50% of the financial goals. Gulf Power s financial
performance goal is ROE, which is defined as Gulf
Power s net income divided by average equity for
the year. For Southern Company Generation, it is
calculated using a corporate-wide weighted average
of all the business unit financial performance
goals, including primarily the ROE of Gulf Power
and affiliated companies, Alabama Power, Georgia
Power, and Mississippi Power. For Mr. McCullough,
the business unit financial goal was weighted 30%
Gulf Power ROE and 20% Southern Company Generation
financial goal. 

The Compensation Committee may make adjustments, both positive and negative, to goal achievement
for purposes of determining payouts. Such adjustments include the impact of items considered
extraordinary or unusual in nature, infrequent in occurrence, outside of normal operations, or not
anticipated in the business plan when the earnings goal was established, and of sufficient
magnitude to warrant recognition. The Compensation Committee made an adjustment in 2009 to
eliminate the effect of a $202 million charge to Southern Company earnings taken in 2009. The
charge related to the settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC (MCAR) to resolve an action
which arose out of the bankruptcy proceeding of Mirant Corporation, a former subsidiary of Southern
Company until its spin-off in April 2001. The settlement included an agreement by Southern Company
to pay MCAR $202 million, which was paid in mid-2009. This adjustment increased the average payout
for 2009 performance by approximately 30%.

Under the terms of the program, no payout can be made if Southern Company s current earnings are
not sufficient to fund its Common Stock dividend at the same level or higher than the prior year.

Goal Details 

Operational Goals: 

Customer Satisfaction   Gulf Power uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate its performance.
The survey results provide an overall ranking for Gulf Power, as well as a ranking for each
customer segment: residential, commercial, and industrial.

Reliability   Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is measured by the
frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set internally based on
historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital expenditures.

Availability   Peak season equivalent forced outage rate is an indicator of availability and
efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are greatest. The
rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours.

Safety   Southern Company s Target Zero program is focused on continuous improvement in having a
safe work environment. The performance is measured by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration recordable incident rate.

Inclusion/Diversity   The inclusion program seeks to improve our inclusive workplace. This goal
includes measures for work environment (employee satisfaction survey), representation of minorities
and females in leadership roles, and supplier diversity.

Southern Company capital expenditures  gate  or threshold goal   For 2009, Southern Company
strived to manage total capital expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel, for the participating
business units at or below $4.5 billion and Gulf Power strived to manage such expenditures at or
below $478 million. If the Southern Company or Gulf Power capital expenditure target is exceeded,
total operational goal performance is capped at 0.90 regardless of the
actual operational goal results. Adjustments to the goal may occur due to significant events not
anticipated in Southern Company s and Gulf Power s business plans established early in 2009, such
as acquisitions or disposition of assets, new capital projects, and other events.

For Mr. McCullough, the operational goals were weighted 60% based on Gulf Power s operational goals
and 40% based on Southern Company Generation s operational goals.

EPS and Business Unit Financial Performance: 

The range of EPS and business unit financial goals for 2009 is shown below. The ROE goal varies
from the allowed retail ROE range due to state regulatory accounting requirements, wholesale
activities, other non-jurisdictional revenues and expenses, and other activities not subject to
state regulation.

2009 Achievement 

Each named executive officer had a target Performance Pay Program opportunity, based on his or her
position, set by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of 2009. Targets are set as a
percentage of base salary. Ms. Story s target was set at 60%. For Ms. Terry and Messrs. Jacob and
Raymond, it was set at 45% and for Mr. McCullough, it was set at 40%. Actual payouts were
determined by adding the payouts derived from EPS and business unit financial performance goal
achievement for 2009 and multiplying that sum by the result of the operational goal achievement.
The gate goal target was not exceeded and therefore did not affect payouts. Actual 2009 goal
achievement is shown in the following table. The EPS result shown in the table is adjusted for the
MCAR settlement charge taken in 2009 as described above. Therefore, payouts were determined using
EPS performance results that differed from the results reported in the financial statements of
Southern Company in Item 8 herein. EPS, as determined in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and as reported by Southern
Company, was $2.07 per share.

III-11  

Table of Contents   

Note that the Total Payout Factor may vary from the Total Weighted Financial Performance Factor
multiplied by the Operational Goal Multiplier due to rounding. To calculate the Performance Pay
Program amount, the target opportunity is multiplied by the Total Payout Factor.

Actual performance, as adjusted, was below the target performance levels established by the
Compensation Committee in early 2009; therefore, the payout levels were below the target pay
opportunities that were established. More information on how target pay opportunities are
established is provided under the Market Data section in this CD A.

The table below shows the pay opportunity set in early 2009 for the annual Performance Pay Program
payout at target-level performance and the actual payout based on the actual performance, as
adjusted, shown above.

Stock Options 

Options to purchase Common Stock are granted annually and were granted in 2009 to the named
executive officers and about 250 other employees of Gulf Power. Options have a 10-year term, vest
over a three-year period, fully vest upon retirement or termination of employment following a
change in control, and expire at the earlier of five years from the date of retirement or the end
of the 10-year term. The Compensation Committee changed the stock option vesting provisions
associated with retirement for stock options granted in 2009 to the executive officers of Southern
Company, including Ms. Story. For these grants made in 2009, unvested options are forfeited if she
retires and accepts a position with a peer company within two years of retirement. The
Compensation Committee made this change to provide more retention value to the stock option awards,
to provide an inducement to not seek a position with a peer company, and to limit the
post-termination compensation of executive officers of Southern Company who do accept positions
with a peer company. Ms. Story became retirement-eligible in early 2010.

As described in the Market Data section above, the Compensation Committee established a target
long-term performance-based compensation value for each named executive officer. The number of
stock options granted, with associated performance dividends, was determined by dividing that
long-term value by the value of a stock option with associated performance dividends. The value of
each stock option was derived using the Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. The assumptions
used in calculating that amount are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements of Gulf Power
in Item 8 herein. For 2009, the Black-Scholes value on the grant date was $1.80 per stock option.
As described in the Market Data section above, the value of the associated performance dividends
was $3.14 per stock option which was 10% of the Common Stock price on the grant date. Therefore,
the target value of each
stock option, with associated performance dividends, was $4.94 per stock option. The calculation of
the 2009 stock option grants for the named executive officers is shown below.

III-12  

Table of Contents   

The calculation of the 2009 stock option grants for the named executive officers is shown below.

More information about the stock option program is contained in the Grant of Plan Based Awards
table and the information accompanying it.

Performance Dividends 

All option holders, including the named executive officers, can receive performance-based dividend
equivalents on stock options held at the end of the year. Performance dividends can range from 0%
to 100% of the Common Stock dividend paid during the year per option held at the end of the year.
Actual payout will depend on Southern Company s total shareholder return over a four-year
performance measurement period compared to a group of other electric and gas utility companies.
The peer group is determined at the beginning of each four-year performance-measurement period.
The peer group varies from the Market Data peer group due to the timing and criteria of the peer
selection process. The peer group for performance dividends is set by the Compensation Committee
at the beginning of the four-year performance-measurement period. However, despite these timing
differences, there is substantial overlap in the companies included.

Total shareholder return is calculated by measuring the ending value of a hypothetical $100
invested in each company s common stock at the beginning of each of 16 quarters. In the final year
of the performance-measurement period, Southern Company s ranking in the peer group is determined
at the end of each quarter and the percentile ranking is multiplied by the actual Common Stock
dividend paid in that quarter. To determine the total payout per stock option held at the end of
the performance-measurement period, the four quarterly amounts earned are added together.

No performance dividends are paid if Southern Company s earnings are not sufficient to fund a
Common Stock dividend at least equal to that paid in the prior year.

2009 Payout 

The peer group used to determine the 2009 payout for the 2006-2009 performance-measurement period
consisted of utilities with revenues of $1.2 billion or more with regulated revenues of 60% or
more. Those companies are listed below.

Southern Company s total shareholder return performance as measured at the end of each quarter of
the final year of the four-year performance-measurement period ending with 2009 was the
83 rd , 83 rd , 53 rd , and 38 th  percentile, respectively,
resulting in a total payout of 64% of the full year s Common Stock dividend, or $1.10. This amount
was multiplied by each named executive officer s outstanding stock options at December 31, 2009 to
calculate the payout under the program. The amount paid is included in the Non-Equity Incentive
Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table.

2012 Opportunity 

The Compensation Committee selected two peer groups for the 2009-2012 performance-measurement
period (which will be used to determine the 2012 payout amount). The results of the two peer
groups will be averaged to determine the payment level. One peer group selected is a published
index, the Philadelphia Utility Index. The other peer group (custom peer group) is a group of
companies that the Company believes are similar to the Company in terms of business models,
including a mix of regulated and non-regulated revenues.

Program.

Timing of Performance-Based Compensation 

As discussed above, Southern Company EPS and Gulf Power s financial performance goal for the 2009
Performance Pay Program were established at the February 2009 Compensation Committee meeting.
Annual stock option grants also were made at that meeting. The establishment of performance-based
compensation goals and the granting of stock options were not timed with the release of material,
non-public information. This procedure was consistent with prior practices. Stock option grants
are made to new hires or newly-eligible participants on preset, regular quarterly dates that were
approved by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price of options granted to employees in 2009
was the closing price of the Common Stock on the grant date or the last trading day before the
grant date if the grant date was not a trading day.

Post-Employment Compensation 

As mentioned above, we provide certain post-employment compensation to employees, including the
named executive officers:

Retirement Benefits 

Generally, all full-time employees of Gulf Power, including the named executive officers,
participate in our funded Pension Plan after completing one year of service. Normal retirement
benefits become payable when participants both attain age 65 and complete five years of
participation. We also provide unfunded benefits that count salary and annual Performance Pay
Program payouts that are ineligible to be counted under the Pension Plan. (These plans are the
Supplemental Benefit Plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan that are described in the
chart on pages III-5 and III-6 of this CD A.) See the Pension Benefits table and the information accompanying
it for more information about pension-related benefits.

Gulf Power also provides the Deferred Compensation Plan which is an unfunded plan that permits
participants to defer income as well as certain federal, state, and local taxes until a specified
date or their retirement, disability, death, or other separation from service. Up to 50% of base
salary and up to 100% of performance-based compensation, except stock options, may be deferred at
the election of eligible employees. All of the named executive officers are eligible to
participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan. See the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table
and the information accompanying it for more information about the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Change-in-Control Protections 

The Compensation Committee initially approved the change-in-control protection program in 1998. The
program provided some level of severance benefits to all employees not part of a collective
bargaining unit, if the conditions of the program were met, as described below. The Compensation
Committee established this program and the levels of severance amount in order to provide certain
compensatory protections to executives upon a change in control and thereby allow them to negotiate
aggressively with a prospective purchaser. Providing such protections to our employees in general
would minimize disruption during a pending or anticipated change in control. For all

III-15  

Table of Contents   

participants, payment and vesting would occur only upon the occurrence of both an actual change in
control and loss of the individual s position. In 2009, the Compensation Committee directed Towers
Perrin to review best practices for change-in-control programs and directed management to recommend
any necessary changes to the program to meet those best practices. The review of the program was
completed in 2009 and changes were made effective in late 2009.

Change-in-control protections, including severance pay and, in some situations, vesting or payment
of long-term performance-based awards, are provided upon a change in control of Southern Company or
Gulf Power coupled with an involuntary termination not for  Cause  or a voluntary termination for
 Good Reason.  This means there is a  double trigger  before severance benefits are paid;  i.e., 
there must be both a change in control and a termination of employment.

If the conditions described above are met, the named executive officers are entitled to severance
payments equal to one or three times their base salary plus the annual performance-based
compensation amount assuming target-level performance. Most officers, including Gulf Power s named
executive officers, are entitled to severance payments equal to one time s  their base salary plus
the annual Performance Pay Program amount assuming target-level performance. Ms. Story is entitled
to the larger amount.

Prior to the changes made in 2009, the named executive officers, other than Ms. Story, were
entitled to severance payments of two times their base salary plus the target-level annual
Performance Pay Program amount. The changes made in 2009 also eliminated the broad-based
change-in-control severance program.

More information about post-employment compensation, including severance arrangements under our
change-in-control program, is included in the section entitled Potential Payments upon Termination
or Change in Control.

Executive Stock Ownership Requirements 

Effective January 1, 2006, the Compensation Committee adopted Common Stock ownership requirements
for officers of Southern Company and its subsidiaries that are in a position of vice president or
above. All of the named executive officers are covered by the requirements. The guidelines were
implemented to further align the interest of officers and Southern Company s stockholders by
promoting a long-term focus and long-term share ownership.

The types of ownership arrangements counted toward the requirements are shares owned outright,
those held in Southern Company-sponsored plans, and Common Stock accounts in the Deferred
Compensation Plan and the Supplemental Benefit Plan. One-third of vested Southern Company stock
options may be counted, but if so, the ownership requirement is doubled.

The requirements are expressed as a multiple of base salary as per the table below.

Impact of Accounting and Tax Treatments on Compensation 

None of the compensation paid to Gulf Power s employees, including the named executive officers, is
subject to the restrictions under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(Code).

Policy on Recovery of Awards 

Southern Company s 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan provides that if Southern Company or
Gulf Power is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance as a
result of misconduct, and if an executive officer knowingly or grossly negligently engaged in or
failed to prevent the misconduct or is subject to automatic forfeiture under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, the executive officer will reimburse Gulf Power the amount of any payment in settlement of
awards earned or accrued during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing
that was restated.

Southern Company Policy Regarding Hedging the Economic Risk of Stock Ownership 

Southern Company s policy is that insiders, including outside directors, will not trade in Southern
Company options on the options market and will not engage in short sales.

2010 Executive Compensation Program Changes 

In 2009, the Compensation Committee made certain key changes to the performance-based compensation
program that affect all employees of Gulf Power, including the named executive officers. Changes
were made to both the annual and long-term performance-based compensation programs.

Annual Performance Pay Program 

For annual performance-based compensation to be earned in 2010, the Compensation Committee changed
the goal weights and lowered the maximum payout opportunity. Under the program in effect since
2000, the 2009 goals were weighted 50% EPS and 50% ROE with an adjustment of plus or minus 10%
based on operational goal performance. The maximum payout opportunity was 220% of the target
opportunity. (For more information, see the description of the Performance Pay Program in the 2009
Performance Based Compensation section in this CD A.) Under the program effective in 2010, the
goals are weighted one-third EPS, one-third ROE, and one-third operational goals. The maximum
payout opportunity is reduced to 200% of target.

Long-Term Performance-Based Compensation Program 

The long-term performance-based compensation program that has been in effect for many years has
consisted of stock options with associated performance dividends. Effective in 2010, stock options
were granted without associated performance dividends. Performance dividends accounted for
approximately 64% of the total long-term performance-based compensation target value for 2009. In
2010, stock options represent 40% of the total value and a new long-term performance-based
compensation component was granted: performance share units. Performance share units represent
60% of the total long-term performance-based compensation target value. A grant date fair value
per unit is determined. For the grant made in 2010, the value per unit was $30.13. The total
target value for performance share units is divided by the value per unit to determine the number
of performance share units granted to each participant, including the named executive officers.
Each performance share unit represents one share of Common Stock. At the end of a three-year
performance-measurement period, the number of units will be adjusted up or down (zero to 200%)
based on Southern Company s total shareholder return relative to that of its peers in the
Philadelphia Utility Index and the custom peer group. (The performance metric, performance scale,
and the peer groups used for the performance share units are the same as that currently used for
the Performance Dividend Program.) The number of performance share units earned will be paid in
Common Stock. No dividends or dividend equivalents will be paid or earned on the performance share
units.

The Compensation Committee also approved a transition period for the Performance Dividend Program.
There are three performance-measurement periods that are still open: 2007-2010, 2008-2011, and
2009-2012. For these open

III-17  

Table of Contents   

periods, the performance at the end of each period will be determined as described above in this
CD A, and the amount earned will be paid on the number of stock options granted prior to 2010 that
a participant holds at the end of each period. Therefore, there will be three additional payouts
under the Performance Dividend Program, but the number of stock options upon which payment will be
based will be limited to those granted prior to 2010.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 

The Compensation Committee met with management to review and discuss the CD A. Based on such
review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Southern Company Board of
Directors that the CD A be included in Gulf Power s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2009. The Southern Company Board of Directors approved that recommendation.

SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE 

The Summary Compensation Table shows the amount and type of compensation received by the Chief
Executive Officer, any Chief Financial Officer, and the next three most highly-paid executive
officers who served in 2009. Collectively, these officers are referred to as the  named executive
officers. 

* 
       
     Mr. Raymond became an executive officer of Gulf Power in 2008. 

Column (e)

No equity-based compensation has been awarded to the named executive officers, or any other
employees of Gulf Power, other than Stock Option Awards which are reported in column (f).

Column (f)

This column reports the aggregate grant date fair value. See Note 8 to the financial statements of
Gulf Power in Item 8 herein for a discussion of the assumptions used in calculating these amounts.

III-19  

Table of Contents   
 
 Column (g)

The amounts in this column are the aggregate of the payouts under the annual Performance Pay
Program and the Performance Dividend Program attributable to performance periods ended December 31,
2009 that are discussed in detail in the CD A. The amounts paid under each program to the named
executive officers are shown below.

Column (h)

This column reports the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of each named executive
officer s accumulated benefit under the Pension Plan and the supplemental pension plans
(collectively, Pension Benefits) during 2007, 2008, and 2009. The amount included for 2007 is the
difference between the actuarial present values of the Pension Benefits measured as of September
30, 2006 and September 30, 2007. However, the amount for 2008 is the difference between the
actuarial values of the Pension Benefits measured as of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2008 -
15 months rather than one year. September 30 was used as the measurement date prior to 2008,
because it was the date as of which Southern Company measured its retirement benefit obligations
for accounting purposes. Starting in 2008, Southern Company changed its measurement date to
December 31. The amount for 2009 is the difference between the actuarial values of the Pension
Benefits measured as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The Pension Benefits as of each
measurement date are based on the named executive officer s age, pay, and service accruals and the
plan provisions applicable as of the measurement date. The actuarial present values as of each
measurement date reflect the assumptions Gulf Power selected for cost purposes as of that
measurement date; however, the named executive officers were assumed to remain employed at Gulf
Power or other Southern Company subsidiary until their benefits commence at the pension plans 
stated normal retirement date, generally age 65. As a result, the amounts in column (h) related to
Pension Benefits represent the combined impact of several factors: growth in the named executive
officer s Pension Benefits over the measurement year; impact on the total present values of one
year shorter discounting period due to the named executive officer being one year closer to normal
retirement; impact on the total present values attributable to changes in assumptions from
measurement date to measurement date; and impact on the total present values attributable to plan
changes between measurement dates.

The present values of accumulated Pension Benefits as of September 30, 2007 reflect new provisions
regarding the form and timing of payments from the supplemental pension plans. These changes
brought those plans into compliance with Section 409A of the Code. The key change was to the form
of payment. Instead of providing monthly payments for the lifetime of each named executive officer
and his/her spouse, these plans will pay the single sum value of those benefits for an average
lifetime in 10 annual installments. Calculations of the present value of accumulated benefits
calculations shown prior to September 30, 2007 reflect supplemental pension benefits being paid
monthly for the lifetimes of named executive officers and their spouses. The 2007 change in
pension value reported in column (h) for each named executive officer is greater than what it
otherwise would have been due to the change in the form of payment.

For more information about the Pension Benefits and the assumptions used to calculate the actuarial
present value of accumulated benefits as of December 31, 2009, see the information following the
Pension Benefits table. The key differences between assumptions used for the actuarial present
values of accumulated benefits calculations as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 follow:

Description of Perquisites 

Personal Financial Planning  is provided for most officers of Gulf Power, including all of the named
executive officers. Gulf Power pays for the services of the financial planner on behalf of the
officers, up to a maximum amount of $8,700 per year, after the initial year that the benefit is
provided. In the initial year, the allowed amount is $15,000. The employing company also provides
a five-year allowance of $6,000 for estate planning and tax return preparation fees.

Personal Use of Company-Provided Club Memberships.  The employing company provides club memberships
to certain officers, including all of the named executive officers. The memberships are provided
for business use; however, personal use is permitted. The amount included reflects the pro-rata
portion of the membership fees paid by the employing company that are attributable to the named
executive officers  personal use. Direct costs associated with any personal use, such as meals,
are paid for or reimbursed by the employee and therefore are not included.

Relocation Benefits.  These benefits are provided to cover the costs associated with geographic
relocation. In 2009, Mr. Raymond received relocation benefits in the amount of $110,596.

Personal Use of Corporate-Owned Aircraft.  Southern Company owns aircraft that are used to
facilitate business travel. If seating is available, Southern Company permits a spouse or other
family member to accompany an employee on a flight. However, because in such cases the aircraft is
being used for a business purpose, there is no incremental cost associated with the family  travel
and no amounts are included for such travel. Any additional expenses incurred that are related to
family  travel are included. Also, for Ms. Story only, effective in 2009, limited personal use
that is associated with business travel is permitted; however, she had no such use in 2009.

Home Security Systems.  Gulf Power pays for the services of third-party providers for the
installation, maintenance, and monitoring of the named executive officers  home security systems.

Other Miscellaneous Perquisites.  The amount included reflects the full cost to Gulf Power of
providing the following items: personal use of company provided tickets for sporting and other
entertainment events and gifts distributed to and activities provided to attendees at
company-sponsored events.

For Ms. Story, effective in 2009, tax reimbursements are no longer made on perquisites, except on
any relocation benefits.

GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS MADE IN 2009 

This table provides information on stock option grants made and goals established for future
payouts under Gulf Power s performance-based compensation programs during 2009 by the Compensation
Committee. In this table, the annual Performance Pay Program and performance dividend payouts are
referred to as PPP and PDP, respectively.

Columns (c), (d), and (e)

The amounts reported as PPP reflect the amounts established by the Compensation Committee in early
2009 to be paid for certain levels of performance as of December 31, 2009 under the annual
Performance Pay Program. Under that program, the Compensation Committee assigns each named
executive officer a target opportunity, expressed as a percentage of base salary, which is paid for
target-level performance under the Performance Pay Program. The target opportunities established
for the named executive officers for 2009 performance were 60% for Ms. Story, 45% for Ms. Terry and
Messrs. Jacob and Raymond, and 40% for Mr. McCullough. The payout for threshold performance was
set at a determined amount of less than one percent of the target opportunity and the maximum
amount payable was set at 2.20 times the target. The amount paid to each named executive officer
under the Performance Pay Program for actual 2009 performance is included in the Non-Equity
Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table and is itemized in the notes
following that table. More information about the annual Performance Pay Program, including the
applicable performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee, is provided in the CD A.

Southern Company also has a long-term performance-based compensation program, the Performance
Dividend Program, which has been adopted by Gulf Power and SCS. It pays performance-based dividend
equivalents based on Southern Company s total shareholder return (TSR) compared with the TSR of its
peer companies over a four-year performance-measurement period. The Compensation Committee
establishes the level of payout for prescribed levels of performance over the
performance-measurement period.

In February 2009, the Compensation Committee established the Performance Dividend Program goal for
the four-year performance-measurement period beginning on January 1, 2009 and ending on December
31, 2012. The amount earned in 2012 based on the performance for 2009-2012 will be paid following
the end of the period. However, no amount is earned and paid unless the Compensation Committee
approves the payment at the beginning

III-23 

Table of Contents   

of the final year of the performance-measurement period. Also, nothing is earned unless Southern
Company s earnings are sufficient to fund a Common Stock dividend at least equal to that paid in
the prior year.

The Performance Dividend Program pays to all option holders a percentage of the Common Stock
dividend paid to Southern Company s stockholders in the last year of the performance-measurement
period. It can range from approximately 2.5% for performance above the 10th percentile compared
with the performance of the peer companies to 100% of the dividend if Southern Company s total shareholder return is at
or above the 90th percentile. That amount is then paid per option granted prior to 2010 and held
at the end of the four-year period. The amount, if any, ultimately paid to the option holders,
including the named executive officers, at the end of the last year of the 2009-2012
performance-measurement period will be based on (1) Southern Company s average total shareholder return compared to that
of its peer companies as of December 31, 2012, (2) the actual dividend paid in 2012 to Southern
Company s stockholders, if any, and (3) the number of options granted prior to 2010 held by the
named executive officers on December 31, 2012.

The number of options held on December 31, 2012 will be affected by the number of options exercised
by the named executive officers prior to December 31, 2012, if any. None of these components
necessary to calculate the range of payout under the Performance Dividend Program for the 2009-2012
performance-measurement period is known at the time the goal is established.

The amounts reported as PDP in columns (c), (d), and (e) were calculated based on the number of
options held by the named executive officers on December 31, 2009, as reported in columns (b) and
(c) of the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table and the Common Stock dividend of
$1.73 per share paid to Southern Company s stockholders in 2009. These factors are itemized below.

More information about the Performance Dividend Program is provided in the CD A.

The stock options vest at the rate of one-third per year, on the anniversary date of the grant.
Also, grants fully vest upon termination as a result of death, total disability, or retirement and
expire five years after retirement, three years after death or total disability, or their normal
expiration date if earlier. Please see Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control

The Compensation Committee granted these stock options to the named executive officers at its
regularly-scheduled meeting on February 19, 2009. Under the terms of the Omnibus Incentive
Compensation Plan, the exercise price was set at the closing price ($31.39 per share) on the last
trading day prior to the grant date of February 16, 2009.

PENSION BENEFITS AT 2009 FISCAL YEAR-END 

The named executive officers earn employer-paid pension benefits from three coordinated retirement
plans. More information about pension benefits is provided in the CD A.

III-26 

Table of Contents   

Pension Plan 

The Pension Plan is a tax-qualified, funded plan. It is Southern Company s primary retirement
plan. Generally, all full-time employees participate in this plan after one year of service.
Normal retirement benefits become payable when participants both attain age 65 and complete five
years of participation. The plan benefit equals the greater of amounts computed using a  1.7%
offset formula  and a  1.25% formula,  as described below. Benefits are limited to a statutory
maximum.

The 1.7% offset formula amount equals 1.7% of final average pay times years of participation less
an offset related to Social Security benefits. The offset equals a service ratio times 50% of the
anticipated Social Security benefits in excess of $4,200. The service ratio adjusts the offset for
the portion of a full career that a participant has worked. The highest three rates of pay out of a
participant s last 10 calendar years of service are averaged to derive final average pay. The pay
considered for this formula is the base rate of pay reduced for any voluntary deferrals. A
statutory limit restricts the amount considered each year; the limit for 2009 was $245,000.

The 1.25% formula amount equals 1.25% of final average pay times years of participation. For this
formula, the final average pay computation is the same as above, but
annual performance-based compensation
 paid
during each year is added to the base rates of pay.

Early retirement benefits become payable once plan participants have during employment both
attained age 50 and completed 10 years of participation. Participants who retire early from active
service receive benefits equal to the amounts computed using the same formulas employed at normal
retirement. However, a 0.3% reduction applies for each month (3.6% for each year) prior to normal
retirement that participants elect to have their benefit payments commence. For example, 64% of
the formula benefits are payable starting at age 55. As of December 31, 2009, only Messrs. Jacob
and Raymond were eligible to retire immediately.

The Pension Plan s benefit formulas produce amounts payable monthly over a participant s
post-retirement lifetime. At retirement, plan participants can choose to receive their benefits in
one of seven alternative forms of payment. All forms pay benefits monthly over the lifetime of the
retiree or the joint lifetimes of the retiree and a spouse. A reduction applies if a retiring
participant chooses a payment form other than a single life annuity. The reduction makes the value
of the benefits paid in the form chosen comparable to what it would have been if benefits were paid
as a single life annuity over the retiree s life.

Participants vest in the Pension Plan after completing five years of service. All the named
executive officers are vested in their Pension Plan benefits. Participants who terminate
employment after vesting can elect to have their pension benefits commencing at age 50 if they
participated in the Pension Plan for 10 years. If such an election is made, the early retirement
reductions that apply are actuarially determined factors and are larger than 0.3% per month.

If a participant dies while actively employed, benefits will be paid to a surviving spouse. A
survivor s benefit equals 45% of the monthly benefit that the participant had earned before his or
her death. Payments to a surviving spouse of a participant who could have retired will begin
immediately. Payments to a survivor of a participant who was not retirement-eligible will begin
when the deceased participant would have attained age 50. After commencing, survivor benefits are
payable monthly for the remainder of a survivor s life. Participants who are eligible for early
retirement may opt to have an 80% survivor benefit paid if they die; however, there is a charge
associated with this election.

If participants become totally disabled, periods that Social Security or employer-provided
disability income benefits are paid will count as service for benefit calculation purposes. The
crediting of this additional service ceases at the point a disabled participant elects to commence
retirement payments. Outside of the extra service crediting, the normal plan provisions apply to
disabled participants.

The Southern Company Supplemental Benefit Plan (Pension-Related) (SBP-P) 

The SBP-P is an unfunded retirement plan that is not tax qualified. This plan provides to
high-paid employees any benefits that the Pension Plan cannot pay due to statutory pay/benefit
limits and voluntary pay deferrals. The SBP-P s vesting, early retirement, and disability
provisions mirror those of the Pension Plan.

The amounts paid by the SBP-P are based on the additional monthly benefit that the Pension Plan
would pay if the statutory limits and pay deferrals were ignored. When an SBP-P participant
separates from service, vested monthly benefits provided by the benefit formulas are converted into
a single sum value. It equals the present value of what would have been paid monthly for an
actuarially determined average post-retirement lifetime. The discount rate used in the calculation
is based on the 30-year Treasury yields for the September preceding the calendar year of
separation, but not more than six percent. Vested participants terminating prior to becoming
eligible to retire will be paid their single sum value as of September 1 following the calendar
year of separation. If the terminating participant is retirement eligible, the single sum value
will be paid in 10 annual installments starting shortly after separation. The unpaid balance of a
retiree s single sum will be credited with interest at the prime rate published in  The Wall Street
Journal . If the separating participant is a  key man  under Section 409A of the Code, the first
installment will be delayed for six months after the date of separation.

If an SBP-P participant dies after becoming vested in the Pension Plan, the spouse of the deceased
participant will receive the installments the participant would have been paid upon retirement. If
a vested participant s death occurs prior to age 50, the installments will be paid to a survivor as
if the participant had survived to age 50.

The Southern Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) 

The SERP also is an unfunded retirement plan that is not tax qualified. This plan provides to high-paid employees additional benefits that the Pension Plan and the SBP-P would pay if the 1.7% offset
formula calculations reflected a portion of annual cash incentives. To derive the SERP benefits, a
final average pay is determined reflecting participants  base rates of pay and their
annual performance-based compensation amounts
 to
the extent they exceed 15% of those base rates (ignoring statutory limits and pay deferrals). This
final average pay is used in the 1.7% offset formula to derive a gross benefit. The Pension Plan
and the SBP-P benefits are subtracted from the gross benefit to calculate the SERP benefit. The
SERP s early retirement, survivor benefit, and disability provisions mirror the SBP-P s provisions.
However, except upon a change in control, SERP benefits do not vest until participants retire, so
no benefits are paid if a participant terminates prior to becoming eligible to retire. More
information about vesting and payment of SERP benefits following a change in control is included in
the section entitled Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.

The following assumptions were used in the present value calculations:

Discount rate   5.95% Pension Plan and 5.60% supplemental plans as of December 31, 2009 

Retirement date   Normal retirement age (65 for all named executive officers) 

Mortality after normal retirement   RP2000 Combined Healthy with generational projections 

Mortality, withdrawal, disability, and retirement rates prior to normal retirement   None 

Form of payment for Pension Benefits 

Spouse ages   Wives two years younger than their husbands 

Annual performance-based compensation earned but unpaid as of the measurement date   130%
of target opportunity percentages times base rate of pay for year amount is earned. 

Installment determination 4.25% discount rate for single sum calculation and 5.25% prime
rate during installment payment period 

For all of the named executive officers, the number of years of credited service is one year less
than the number of years of employment.

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION AS OF 2009 FISCAL YEAR-END 

Southern Company provides the DCP which is designed to permit participants to defer income as well
as certain federal, state, and local taxes until a specified date or their retirement, or other
separation from service. Up to 50% of base salary and up to 100% of performance-based
compensation, except stock options, may be deferred, at the election of eligible employees. All of
the named executive officers are eligible to participate in the DCP.

Participants have two options for the deemed investments of the amounts deferred   the Stock
Equivalent Account and the Prime Equivalent Account. Under the terms of the DCP, participants are
permitted to transfer between investments at any time.

The amounts deferred in the Stock Equivalent Account are treated as if invested at an equivalent
rate of return to that of an actual investment in Common Stock, including the crediting of dividend
equivalents as such are paid by Southern Company from time to time. It provides participants with
an equivalent opportunity for the capital appreciation (or loss) and income of that of  a Southern
Company stockholder. During 2009, the rate of return in the Stock Equivalent Account was (4.83%),
which was Southern Company s TSR for 2009.

Alternatively, participants may elect to have their deferred compensation deemed invested in the
Prime Equivalent Account which is treated as if invested at a prime interest rate compounded
monthly, as published in  The Wall Street Journal  as the base rate on corporate loans posted as of
the last business day of each month by at least 75% of the United States  largest banks. The
interest rate earned on amounts deferred during 2009 in the Prime Equivalent Account was 3.25%.

Column (b)

This column reports the actual amounts of compensation deferred under the DCP by each named
executive officer in 2009. The amount of salary deferred by the named executive officers, if any,
is included in the Salary column in the Summary Compensation Table.
The amounts of
performance-based compensation deferred in 2009 were the amounts paid for performance under the
annual Performance Pay Program and the Performance Dividend Program that were earned as of December
31, 2008 but not payable until the first quarter of 2009. These amounts are not reflected in the
Summary Compensation Table because that table reports performance-based compensation that was
earned in 2009, but not payable until early 2010. These deferred amounts may be distributed in a
lump sum or in up to 10 annual installments at termination of employment or in a lump sum at a
specified date, at the election of the participant.

Column (c)

This column reflects contributions under the SBP. Under the Code, employer matching contributions
are prohibited under the ESP on employee contributions above stated limits in the ESP, and, if
applicable, above legal limits set forth in the Code. The SBP is a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan under which contributions are made that are prohibited from being made in the
ESP. The contributions are treated as if invested in Common Stock and are payable in cash upon
termination of employment in a lump sum or in up to 20 annual installments, at the election of

the participant. The amounts reported in this column also were reported in the All Other
Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table.

Column (d)

This column reports earnings or losses on both compensation the named executive officers elected to
defer and on employer contributions under the SBP. See the notes to column (h) of the Summary
Compensation Table for a discussion of amounts of nonqualified deferred compensation earnings
included in the Summary Compensation Table.

Column (f)

This column includes amounts that were deferred under the DCP and contributions under the SBP in
prior years and reported in Gulf Power s prior years  Information Statements or Annual Reports on
Form 10-K. The chart below shows the amounts reported in Gulf Power s prior years  Information
Statements or Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 

This section describes and estimates payments that could be made to the named executive officers
under different termination and change-in-control events. The estimated payments would be made
under the terms of Southern Company s compensation and benefits programs or the change-in-control
severance program. All of the named executive officers are participants in Southern Company s
change-in-control severance plan for officers. The amount of potential payments is calculated as
if the triggering events occurred as of December 31, 2009 and assumes that the price of Common
Stock is the closing market price on December 31, 2009.

Description of Termination and Change-in-Control Events 

The following charts list different types of termination and change-in-control events that can
affect the treatment of payments under the compensation and benefit programs. These events also
affect payments to the named executive officers under their change-in-control severance agreements.
No payments are made under the severance agreements unless, within two years of the change in
control, the named executive officer is involuntarily terminated or he or she voluntarily
terminates for Good Reason. (See the description of Good Reason below.)

Traditional Termination Events 

Retirement or Retirement Eligible   Termination of a named executive officer who is at
least 50 years old and has at least 10 years of credited service. 

Resignation   Voluntary termination of a named executive officer who is not retirement-eligible. 

Lay Off   Involuntary termination of a named executive officer not for cause, who is not
retirement-eligible. 

III-30 

Table of Contents   

Involuntary Termination   Involuntary termination of a named executive officer for cause.
Cause includes individual performance below minimum performance standards and misconduct, such
as violation of Gulf Power s Drug and Alcohol Policy. 

Death or Disability   Termination of a named executive officer due to death or disability. 

Change-in-Control-Related Events 

At the Southern Company or Gulf Power level: 

Southern Company Change-in-Control I   Acquisition by another entity of 20% or more of
Common Stock, or following a merger with another entity Southern Company s stockholders own
65% or less of the entity surviving the merger. 

Southern Company Change-in-Control II   Acquisition by another entity of 35% or more of
Common Stock, or following a merger with another entity Gulf Power s stockholders own less
than 50% of Gulf Power surviving the merger. 

Southern Company Termination   A merger or other event and Southern Company is not the
surviving company or the Common Stock is no longer publicly traded. 

Gulf Power Change in Control   Acquisition by another entity, other than another subsidiary
of Southern Company, of 50% or more of the stock of Gulf Power, a merger with another entity
and Gulf Power is not the surviving company, or the sale of substantially all the assets of
Gulf Power. 

At the employee level: 

Involuntary Change-in-Control Termination or Voluntary Change-in-Control Termination for
Good Reason   Employment is terminated within two years of a change in control, other than for
cause, or the employee voluntarily terminates for Good Reason. Good Reason for voluntary
termination within two years of a change in control generally  is satisfied when there is a
material reduction in salary, performance-based compensation opportunity or benefits,
relocation of over 50 miles, or a diminution in duties and responsibilities.

Potential Payments 

This section describes and estimates payments that would become payable to the named executive
officers upon a termination or change in control as of December 31, 2009.

Pension Benefits 

The amounts that would have become payable to the named executive officers if the Traditional
Termination Events occurred as of December 31, 2009 under the Pension Plan, the SBP-P, and the SERP
are itemized in the chart below. The amounts shown under the column Retirement are amounts that
would have become payable to the named executive officers that were retirement-eligible on December
31, 2009 and are the monthly Pension Plan benefits and the first of 10 annual installments from the
SBP-P and the SERP. The amounts shown under the column Resignation or Involuntary Termination are
the amounts that would have become payable to the named executive officers who were not retirement-eligible on December 31, 2009 and are the monthly Pension Plan benefits that would become payable
as of the earliest possible date under the Pension Plan and the single sum value of benefits earned
up to the termination date under the SBP-P, paid as a single payment rather than in 10 annual
installments. Benefits under the SERP would be forfeited. The amounts shown that are payable to a
spouse in the event of the death of the named executive officer are the monthly amounts payable to
a spouse under the Pension Plan and the first of 10 annual installments from the SBP-P and the
SERP. The amounts in this chart are very different from the pension values shown in the Summary
Compensation Table and the Pension Benefits table. Those tables show the

III-34 

Table of Contents   

present values of all the benefits amounts anticipated to be paid over the lifetimes of the named
executive officers and their spouses. Those plans are described in the notes following the Pension
Benefits table. Of the named executive officers, only Messrs. Jacob and Raymond were retirement
eligible on December 31, 2009.

As described in the Change-in-Control Chart, the only change in the form of payment, acceleration,
or enhancement of the pension benefits is that the single sum value of benefits earned up to the
change-in-control date under the SBP-P and the SERP could be paid as a single payment rather than
in 10 annual installments. Also, the SERP benefits vest for participants who are not retirement-eligible upon a change in control. Estimates of the single sum payment that would have been made
to the named executive officers, assuming termination as of December 31, 2009 following a
change-in-control event, other than a Southern Company Change-in-Control I (which does not impact
how pension benefits are paid), are itemized below. These amounts would be paid instead of the
benefits shown in the Traditional Termination Events chart above; they are not paid in addition to
those amounts.

The pension benefit amounts in the tables above were calculated as of December 31, 2009 assuming
payments would begin as soon as possible under the terms of the plans. Accordingly, appropriate
early retirement reductions were applied. Any unpaid annual performance-based compensation was
assumed to be paid at 1.30 times the target level. Pension Plan benefits were calculated assuming
each named executive officer chose a single life annuity form of payment, because that results in
the greatest monthly benefit. The single sum values of the SBP-P and the SERP benefits were based
on a 4.25% discount rate as prescribed by the terms of the plan.

Annual Performance Pay Program 

The amount payable if a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2009 is the greater of
target or actual performance. Because actual payouts for 2009 performance were below the target
level, the amount that would have been payable was the target level amount as reported in the
Grants of Plan-Based Awards table.

III-35 

Table of Contents   

Performance Dividends 

Because the assumed termination date is December 31, 2009, there is no additional amount that would
be payable other than what was reported in the Summary Compensation Table. As described in the
Traditional Termination Events chart, there is some continuation of benefits under the Performance
Dividend Program for retirees.

However, under the Change-in-Control-Related Events, performance dividends are payable at the
greater of target performance or actual performance. For the 2006-2009 performance-measurement
period, actual performance exceeded target-level performance.

Stock Options 

Stock Options would be treated as described in the Termination and Change-in-Control charts above.
Under a Southern Company Termination, all stock options vest. In addition, if there is an
Involuntary Change-in-Control Termination or Voluntary Change-in-Control Termination for Good
Reason, stock options vest. There is no payment associated with stock options unless there is a
Southern Company Termination and the participants  stock options cannot be converted into surviving
company stock options. In that event, the excess of the exercise price and the closing price of
the Common Stock on December 31, 2009 would be paid in cash for all stock options held by the named
executive officers. The chart below shows the number of stock options for which vesting would be
accelerated under a Southern Company Termination and the amount that would be payable under a
Southern Company Termination if there were no conversion to the surviving company s stock options.

DCP and SBP 

The aggregate balances reported in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table would be payable to
the named executive officers as described in the Traditional Termination and
Change-in-Control-Related Events charts above. There is no enhancement or acceleration of payments
under these plans associated with termination or change-in-control events, other than the lump-sum
payment opportunity described in the above charts. The lump sums that would be payable are those
that are reported in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.

Health Benefits 

Messrs. Jacob
and Raymond are retirement-eligible and health care benefits are provided to
retirees, and there is no incremental payment associated with the termination or change-in-control
events. At the end of 2009, Mss. Story and Terry and
Mr. McCullough were not retirement-eligible
and thus health care benefits would not become available until each reaches age 50, except in the
case of a change-in-control-related termination, as described in the Change-in-Control-Related
Events chart. The estimated cost of providing three years of group health insurance premiums for
Ms. Story is $14,000, two years for Ms. Terry is $9,000, and two years for Mr. McCullough is
$20,000.

III-36 

Table of Contents   

Financial Planning Perquisite 

Since
Messrs. Jacob and Raymond are retirement-eligible, an additional year of the Financial
Planning perquisite, which is set at a maximum of $8,700 per year, will be provided after
retirement. Mss. Story and Terry and Mr. McCullough are not
retirement-eligible.

There are no other perquisites provided to the named executive officers under any of the
traditional termination or change-in-control-related events.

Severance Benefits 

The named executive officers are participants in a change-in-control severance plan. In addition
to the treatment of health benefits, the annual Performance Pay Program, and the Performance
Dividend Program described above, the named executive officers are entitled to a severance benefit,
including outplacement services, if within two years of a change in control, they are involuntarily
terminated, not for Cause, or they voluntarily terminate for Good Reason. The severance benefits
are not paid unless the named executive officer releases the employing company from any claims he
or she may have against the employing company.

The estimated cost of providing the six months of outplacement services is $6,000 per named
executive officer. The severance payment is three times the base salary and target payout under
the annual Performance Pay Program for Ms. Story and one times the base salary and target payout
under the annual Performance Pay Program for the other named executive officers. For Ms. Story, if
any portion of the severance payment is an  excess parachute payment  as defined under Section 280G
of the Code, Gulf Power will pay her an additional amount to cover the taxes that would be due on
the excess parachute payment   a  tax gross-up.  However, that additional amount will not be paid
unless the severance amount plus all other amounts that are considered parachute payments under the
Code exceed 110% of the severance payment.

The table below estimates the severance payments that would be made to the named executive officers
if they were terminated as of December 31, 2009 in connection with a change in control. There is
no estimated tax gross-up included for Ms. Story because her estimated severance amount payable is
below the amount considered excess parachute payments under the Code. None of the other named
executive officer is eligible for a tax gross-up.

COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT 

Southern Company reviewed its compensation policies and practices, including those of Gulf Power,
and concluded that excessive risk-taking is not encouraged. This conclusion was based on an
assessment of the mix of pay components and performance goals, the annual pay/performance analysis
by the Compensation Committee s consultant, stock ownership requirements, our compensation
governance practices, and our  claw-back  provision.

The assessment was reviewed with the Compensation Committee.

WHEREAS,  the Company desires
to amend the Plan to change the severance benefits paid under the Plan, to
eliminate certain tax gross-up provisions, and to grandfather participants in
the Plan as of October 18, 2009. 

NOW, THEREFORE , the Plan is
hereby amended in the following particulars effective as of October 19, 2009,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.5 of the Plan: 

1. 

Section 2.18 of the Plan shall be
replaced in its entirety with the following new provision: 

2.18            Employee 
shall mean those employees of Southern, the Company or any other Southern
Subsidiary identified in either Subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.18,
except as otherwise provided in Subsection (c) hereof. 

(a)           Chief
Executive Officer of Southern and the senior officers of Southern, the Company
or any other Southern Subsidiary who report directly to the Chief Executive
Officer of Southern. 

(b)           Any
employee of Southern, the Company or any other Southern Subsidiary that the
Compensation Committee has designated as eligible to participate in the Plan
based upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer of
Southern. 

(c)           Notwithstanding
Subsections (a) and (b) above, no employee shall participate in the Plan if
either of the following circumstances apply:  (1) the Compensation
Committee has designated the employee as ineligible to participate in the Plan
based upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer of Southern; or (2)
if, prior to a Change in Control, the employee has entered into a change in
control agreement with his Employing Company. 

(d)           The
Compensation Committee may deem one or more Employees of a particular Southern
Subsidiary to be employed by another Employing Company for purposes of this
Plan.  Such action shall be in writing and shall cause an Employee to
be entitled to benefits under this Plan in the event of a Change in Control of
his deemed Employing Company, not his Employing
Company.  Notwithstanding the above, no Employee shall participate in
the Plan if, prior to a Change in Control, the Employee is entitled to, and
elects to receive benefits under any other change in control severance plan,
agreement or arrangement. 

(e)           An
Employee shall immediately cease to be an Employee who is eligible to
participate in the Plan if he no longer holds one of the named positions set
forth in Subsection (a) of this Section 2.18 unless the Compensation Committee
has designated (upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer of
Southern) the Employee is eligible to participate in the Plan under Subsection
(b) hereof. 

2. 

Section 3.2(b) of the Plan shall be
replaced in its entirety with the following new provision: 

(b)            Severance
Benefit .  (i) Except as otherwise provided in Sections
3.2(b)(ii) or 3.2(b)(iii) hereof, Participants shall be paid in cash an amount
equal to two times the Participant s Annual
Compensation.  Notwithstanding the above, Participants who have the
job title of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of Southern shall be paid in cash an amount equal to three
times the Participant s Annual Compensation.  (Such amounts described
above are referred to as the  Severance Amount .) 

(ii)           If
any portion of the Severance Amount constitutes an  excess parachute payment 
(as such term is defined under Code Section 280G ( Excess Parachute Payment )),
then the Severance Amount shall be capped so that the Severance Amount, when
combined with all other  parachute payments  (as such term is defined under Code
Section 280G) received by the Participant (the  Total Parachute Payments ),
equals three (3) times the Participant s base amount (as such term is defined
under Code Section 280G (the  Base Amount )), less one dollar (the  Capped
Amount ), but only if the Capped Amount, reduced by the hospital insurance tax
under Code Section 3101(b) ( HI Tax ) and federal and state income tax measured
at the highest marginal rates ( Income Tax ), exceeds the uncapped Total
Parachute Payments, reduced by HI Tax, Income Tax and the tax rate under Code
Section 4999 ( Excise Tax ). 

For purposes of this Section
3.2(b)(ii), whether any amount would constitute an Excess Parachute Payment and
any other calculations of tax, e.g., Excise Tax, HI Tax, Income Tax, etc., or
other amounts, e.g., Total Parachute Payments, Base Amount, Capped Amount, etc.,
shall be determined by a nationally recognized firm specializing in federal
income taxes as selected by the Compensation Committee, and such calculations or
determinations shall be binding upon the Participants, Southern and the
Employing Company. 

(iii)           Section
3.2(b)(i) and (ii) above shall not apply to any Employee covered by this Plan on
October 18, 2009 for so long as the Employee remains in the job title held on
such date or the Employee is promoted or otherwise transferred after October 18,
2009 into another job title covered by this Plan (the  Grandfathered
Employee ).  For Grandfathered Employees, the following provisions
shall apply: Participants shall be paid in cash an amount equal to three times
the Participant s Annual Compensation (the  Severance Amount ). If any portion
of the Severance Amount constitutes an  excess parachute payment  (as such term
is defined under Code Section 280G ( Excess Parachute Payment )), the Employing
Company shall pay to the Participant an additional amount calculated by
determining the amount of tax under Code Section 4999 that he otherwise would
have paid on any Excess Parachute Payment with respect to the Change in Control
and dividing such amount by a decimal determined by adding the tax rate under
Code Section 4999 ( Excise Tax ), the hospital insurance tax under Code Section
3101(b) ( HI Tax ) and federal and state income tax measured at the highest
marginal rates ( Income Tax ) and subtracting such result from the number one
(1) (the  280G Gross-up  provided, however, that no 280G Gross-up shall be
paid unless the Severance Amount plus all other  parachute payments  to the
Participant under Code Section 280G exceeds three (3) times the Participant s
 base amount  (as such term is defined under Code Section 280G ( Base Amount ))
by ten percent (10%) or more; provided further, that if no 280G Gross-up is
paid, the Severance Amount shall be capped at three (3) times the Participant s
Base Amount, less all other  parachute payments  (as such term is defined under
Code Section 280G) received by the Participant, less one dollar (the  Capped
Amount ), if the Capped Amount, reduced by HI Tax and Income Tax, exceeds what
otherwise would have been the Severance Amount, reduced by HI Tax, Income Tax
and Excise Tax. 

For purposes of this Section
3.2(b)(iii), whether any amount would constitute an Excess Parachute Payment and
any other calculations of tax, e.g., Excise Tax, HI Tax, Income Tax, etc., or
other amounts, e.g., Base Amount, Capped Amount, etc., shall be determined by a
nationally recognized firm specializing in federal income taxes as selected by
the Compensation Committee, and such calculations or determinations shall be
binding upon the Participants, Southern and the Employing Company. 

3. 

All other provisions of the Plan not
inconsistent with the above changes shall remain in effect. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  this First
Amendment has been executed on this 22nd day of February, 2010, by a duly
authorized officer of Southern Company Services, Inc. pursuant to resolutions of
the Board of Directors of the Company adopted on October 19, 2009.

Exhibit 10(a)24 
        FIRST
AMENDMENT TO 

        THE
SOUTHERN COMPANY 

        EXECUTIVE
CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE PLAN 

WHEREAS,  the Southern Company
Executive Change in Control Severance Plan ( Plan ) was originally established
by Southern Company Services, Inc. on December 7, 1998 and most recently amended
and restated on December 31, 2008 to provide certain benefits to eligible
employees that may be terminated from employment following a change in control
as contemplated therein; and 

WHEREAS,  the Company, through
its Board of Directors, is authorized to amend the Plan in accordance with the
requirements of  Section 6.5 of the Plan; and 

WHEREAS,  the Company desires
to amend the Plan to cover employees in Grade Levels 11 and above and to change
the amount of the Severance Benefit to one times the Participant s Annual
Compensation. 

NOW, THEREFORE , the Plan is
hereby amended in the following particulars effective on October 19, 2009
subject to the provisions of Section 6.5 of the Plan: 

1. 

Section 2.19 of the Plan shall be
replaced in its entirety with the following new provision: 

2.19             Employee   shall mean
each regular full-time or regular part-time employee of an Employing Company of
Grade Levels 11 and above not covered by a collective bargaining agreement
between the Employing Company and a union or other employee representative who
is an employee of an Employing Company on the date the Change in Control is
Consummated.  The Administrative Committee may deem one or more
Employees of a particular Southern Subsidiary to be employed by another
Employing Company for purposes of this Plan.  Such action shall be in
writing and shall cause such an Employee to be entitled to benefits under this
Plan in the event of a Change in Control of his deemed Employing Company, not
his Employing Company.  Notwithstanding the above, no Employee shall
participate in the Plan if, prior to a Change in Control, the Employee is
entitled to, and elects to receive, benefits under any other change in control
severance plan, agreement or arrangement. 

2. 

          Section 3.2(b) of the Plan shall be
replaced in its entirety with the following new provision: 

(b)            Severance
Benefit .  Participants shall be paid in cash an amount equal to
one times the Participant s Annual Compensation, but not in excess of the Capped
Amount.  For purposes of this Section 3.2(b), the Capped Amount shall
be the amount otherwise payable under this Section 3.2(b), reduced in such
amount and to such extent that no amount of the payment under this Section
3.2(b), plus all other  parachute payments  under Code Section 280G, would
constitute an  excess parachute payment  under Code Section 280G, but only to
the extent that if the payment under this Section 3.2(b) were increased by one
additional dollar ($1.00), a portion of the payment under this Section 3.2(b)
would be an  excess parachute payment  under Code Section 280G.  The
calculation of the Capped Amount and any other determinations relating to the
applicability of Code Section 280G (and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder) to the payments contemplated by this Plan shall be made by a
nationally recognized firm specializing in federal income taxes as selected by
the Administrative Committee, and such calculations or determinations shall be
binding upon the Participants, Southern and the Employing Company. 

3. 

          All other provisions of the Plan not
inconsistent with the above changes shall remain in effect. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  this First
Amendment has been executed on this 22nd day of February, 2010, by a duly
authorized officer of Southern Company Services, Inc. pursuant to resolutions of
the Board of Directors of the Company on October 19, 2009.

Exhibit 10(b)21  
        DEFERRED
COMPENSATION AGREEMENT 

THIS
DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT ( Agreement ) is made and entered into by THE
SOUTHERN COMPANY, ( Southern ), SOUTHERN COMPANY SERVICES, INC. ( SCS ), ALABAMA
POWER COMPANY (the  Company ) (collectively the  Southern Parties ) and MARK A.
CROSSWHITE ( Employee ), this 30th day of July, 2008 ( Effective
Date ). 

         W I T N E S S E T
H  

        WHEREAS,
Employee is a highly compensated employee of the Company and is a member of its
management; 

        WHEREAS,
although Employee s career with the Southern Company system began
on   March 15, 2004, his valuable services to Southern and its
affiliated subsidiaries began at an earlier date while he was employed as a
lawyer with Balch   Bingham LLP; 

        WHEREAS,
Employee has accepted the transfer of his employment within Southern s group of
affiliated companies on several occasions, having been an officer and employee
of SCS and the Company; 

        WHEREAS,
the Southern Parties desire to set forth the manner in which the benefits
provided to Employee under this Agreement as a result of the recognition of his
prior valuable service will be shared; and 

        WHEREAS,
the parties desire to restate all earlier agreements, including that certain
Deferred Compensation Agreement entered into April 12, 2004, and to provide for
the assignment of this Agreement to any successor employer in the Southern
affiliated group in the event Employee hereafter transfers his employment to any
such successor employer. 

        NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the agreements of the parties
set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to
be legally bound, hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

        1.       Eligibility for Supplemental
Retirement Benefits . 

(a)      Subject
to the terms of this Agreement, if the Employee remains employed with the
Company until such time he has accrued five (5) years of vesting service (the
 Service Requirement ) under The Southern Company Pension Plan (the  Pension
Plan ), the Southern Parties shall pay to Employee (or if Payment continues, to
Employee s designated beneficiary, as the case may be, in the event of
Employee s death as described in Section 1(c) hereof) the supplemental
retirement payment (the  Payment ) described in Section 1(b) hereof (to be
shared among the Company, Southern and SCS in such pro rata portions as set
forth in Sections 2 or 3 hereof). 

The
Service Requirement shall not apply if the Employee is terminated under
circumstances that result in eligibility for severance benefits under The
Southern Company Executive Change in Control Severance Plan ( Change in Control
Termination ).  With respect to a Change in Control Termination only,
the Employee shall be deemed to have accrued under this Agreement a vested
deferred pension benefit (and not a retirement benefit) based on his actual age
and service plus the service provided under Section 1(b)(i) below otherwise
determined as more generally described in Section 1(b) below.  For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Service Requirement is satisfied before a Change in
Control Termination, the Employee s Payment under this Agreement shall be based
on Employee s actual age and service plus the service provided under Section
1(b)(i) below as otherwise determined as more generally described in Section
1(b) below. 

                   (b)     In the
event Employee satisfies the requirements of this Agreement, the Payment shall
be an amount equal to the difference between: 

        (i)     the
amounts payable to Employee under the Pension Plan, the Southern Company
Supplemental Benefit Plan ( SBP ) and the Southern Company Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP ) (collectively, the  Retirement Plans ) as
each shall then be in effect, determined as if Employee had an additional
fifteen (15) years of Accredited Service under the Pension Plan;
and 

        (ii)     the
amounts Employee is actually entitled to receive under the Retirement Plans at
Employee s retirement, as each shall then be in effect, as further determined
and payable in accordance with Section 1(d) hereof. 

        (c)      Payment in the Event of
Death .  In the event Employee dies and Payment continues to
Employee s designated beneficiary (the  Death Benefit ), such Payment shall be
made in accordance with Section 1(d) hereof. 

       2

(d)      Calculation, Form and Timing
of Payment .  The calculation (including actuarial assumptions),
form and timing of the Payment or Death Benefit upon the occurrence of a
 separation from service  as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder ( Separation from Service ) shall be the same
as the calculation (including actuarial assumptions), form and timing of similar
payments to Employee or designated beneficiary as the case may be, under the
terms of the SERP and the SBP (but, as to the SBP, only concerning the  Pension
Benefit  provided thereunder) as each may be amended from time to
time. 

        (e)      Termination for
Cause .  In the event of Employee s termination of employment
for Cause at any time, the Employee shall forfeit the entire benefit provided in
this Section 1, and Southern, the Company, SCS and any of their respective
affiliates (the  Southern Entities ) shall have no further obligations with
respect to any amount under this Agreement.  As used in this
Agreement, the term  Cause  shall mean gross negligence or willful misconduct in
the performance of the duties and services required in the course of employment
by the Company; the final conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral
turpitude; the carrying out of any activity or the making of any statement which
would prejudice the good name and standing of any of the Southern Entities or
would bring any of the Southern Entities into contempt, ridicule or would
reasonably shock or offend any community in which any of the Southern Entities
is located; a material breach of the fiduciary obligations owed by an officer
and an employee to any of the Southern Entities; or the Employee s
unsatisfactory performance of the duties and services required by his
employment. 

        (f)      Misconduct .  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event the Employee engages in Misconduct, as defined
below, before or after the Employee s termination date but prior to receiving
all of the payments described in this Section 1, the Company may cease making
payments to the Employee under this Section 1, and the Company shall have no
further obligations with respect to any amounts under this
Agreement.  For purposes of this Section 1(f),  Misconduct  shall mean
(i) the final conviction of any felony, or (ii) the carrying out of
any activity or the making of any public statement which materially diminishes
the good name and standing of any Southern Entity or materially and untruthfully
brings one or all of the Southern Entities into contempt, ridicule or materially
and reasonably shocks or offends the community in which a Southern Entity is
located. 

       3

2.      Sharing of
Expense .  In the event that the Employee is employed at more
than one subsidiary or affiliate of Southern, the liability for amounts paid
under this Agreement shall be apportioned so that each such company is obligated
in accordance with this Section 2 to cover their percentage of the total
liability as determined below.  Each company s share of the liability
shall be calculated by multiplying the Payment by a fraction where the numerator
of such fraction is the base rate of pay received by the Employee at the
respective company on his date of termination of employment or transfer, as
applicable, multiplied by the Accredited Service as defined in the Pension Plan
earned by the Employee at the respective company and where the denominator of
such fraction is the sum of all numerators calculated for each respective
company by which the Employee has been employed. 

        3.      Transfer of Employment to a
Southern Subsidiary or Affiliate . In the event that Employee s employment
by the Company is terminated and Employee shall become immediately re-employed
by a subsidiary or an affiliate of Southern, the Company shall assign this
Agreement pursuant to an Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit 1 attached hereto, and such assignee shall become the  Company  for all
purposes hereunder.  Such subsidiary or affiliate shall accept such
assignment, but if for any reason this does not occur, Southern shall accept
such assignment.  In the event of such assignment, liability for any
amounts to be paid under this Agreement shall be shared pro rata by the Company,
Southern, SCS and any such assignee (collectively  Contract Obligors ) based
upon the allocation methodology set forth in Section 2. 

        4.      Business Protection
Provisions . 

        (a)        Preamble .  As
a material inducement to the Southern Parties to enter into this Agreement, and
the recognition of the valuable experience, knowledge and proprietary
information Employee gained from his employment with the Company, Employee
warrants and agrees he will abide by and adhere to the following business
protection provisions in this Section 4. 

        (b)

and irreparable injury and damage to Company that is not fully compensable by
monetary damages. Should Consultant breach or threaten to breach any provision

and remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction (including but not limited to

Consultant
shall and does hereby expressly agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, parent and affiliates
against any and all suits, actions, judgments, costs (including, without
limitation, all court costs and attorneys  fees), losses, damages, or claims of
whatever nature arising out of or related to any acts or omissions of

arbitration. 

13.            Waiver of
Breach.  

The
waiver by any party to this Agreement of a breach of any provision, section or
paragraph of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach of the same, or of a different provision, section or
paragraph, by any party hereto. 

14.            Assignment by
Consultant.  

Consultant
may not assign, transfer or subcontract any of his rights or obligations under

interpreting this Agreement shall be authorized and instructed to rewrite any of
the sections which are enforceable as written in such a fashion so that they may
be enforced to the greatest extent legally possible. Consultant acknowledges and
agrees that the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be
construed as covenants and agreements independent of each other or any other
contract between the parties hereto and that the existence of any claim or cause
of action by Consultant against the Company, whether predicted upon this
Agreement or any other contract, shall not constitute a defense to the
enforcement by the Company of said covenants and agreements. 

8

17.            Interpretation.  

Should a
provision of this Agreement require judicial interpretation, it is agreed that
the judicial body interpreting or construing the Agreement shall not apply the
assumption that the terms hereof shall be more strictly construed against one
party by reason of the rule of construction that an instrument is to be
construed more strictly against the party which itself or through its or his
agents prepared the agreement, it being agreed that all parties and/or their
agents have participated in the preparation hereof. 

18.            Survival.  

Notwithstanding
any expiration or termination of this Agreement, the provisions of Sections 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 hereof shall survive and remain
in full force and effect, as shall any other provision hereof that, by its terms
or reasonable interpretation thereof, sets forth obligations that extend beyond
the termination of this Agreement. 

19.            Entire
Agreement.  

This
Agreement and the Separation and Release Agreement embodies the entire Agreement
of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties hereto
relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by a written instrument signed by both Employee and an authorized
representative of the Company. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the
parties hereto have executed this Agreement this 18th day of March,

Exhibit 14(a)  
        Southern
Company Code of Ethics 

Introduction 

        Our Code
of Ethics advises us on proper business conduct.  It links our values
  Southern Style   to the company s high expectations for ethical
behavior.  Each Code provision addresses an important dimension of our
business.  Where more specific information is needed, Southern Company
and subsidiary policies provide details.  More information, including
frequently asked questions, links to training and related information, is also
available on the Ethics and Compliance intranet Web site. 

Dear
Colleagues: 

Southern
Style defines us as a company and as individual employees.  At every
moment we aspire to model Southern Style values. 

With
Southern Style as its foundation, the Code of Ethics provides everyday guidance
on how we conduct business.  It establishes a high standard and
commits us to following the ethical and legal business principles that embody
our values. 

I am
personally committed to adhering to this Code, and I expect everyone in Southern
Company and all its subsidiaries to do the same.  Anyone   director,
officer, employee, or vendor   who violates this code, puts their relationship
with the company in jeopardy. 

There is
no better way to preserve and build our reputation for unquestionable trust than
by adhering to this Code.  That means understanding the Code, using it
as a reference in our everyday work, and speaking up whenever we see behavior
that does not meet our high ethical standards. 

Sincerely, 

David M.
Ratcliffe 

Our
Employees 

        We treat
each other with fairness, respect, and dignity, offering equal opportunities to
all individuals. Intimidation, harassment, or discrimination based on race, sex,
age, color, religion, national origin, veteran's status, sexual orientation, or
disability is not tolerated. We value individual differences and encourage
different perspectives and ideas - understanding that inclusion and diversity
are strengths that unlock our full potential and help us achieve our goals. We
take personal responsibility for individual and organizational success, while
recognizing the value each of us contributes. Everyone who works for the company
is recognized and competitively rewarded for their contributions. 

1

Safety
  Health 

        All
accidents can be prevented. Safety, a key measure of our success, is our
individual 

        and
collective responsibility. We do not compromise safety and health. Because we
care, we value the health and safety of each other, our contractors, and the
public by conducting business in a manner designed to preserve the well-being of
all. We work safely, watch out for each other and report and correct unsafe
situations. We keep our workplace free from violence, illegal drugs and the
inappropriate use of alcohol. 

The
Environment 

        We are
committed to improving our environmental performance and the communities we
serve by being good environmental stewards and working to conserve valuable
natural resources. The health of our employees, customers, and the public, and
the protection of our natural environment are among our highest
priorities. 

Compliance
with Laws and Regulations 

        We
respect the law. We comply with all laws and regulations. We have a
responsibility to understand the laws and how they apply to our
jobs. 

The
Company supports each employee in this responsibility and provides the necessary
resources for compliance. All employees have a  Duty to Act    an obligation
to report activities that may be in violation of any applicable law or
regulation. If it is found that any law or regulation has been violated,
corrective and responsible action will be taken. 

Confidential
Information 

        We use
confidential information only for the business purpose for which it was
developed or given, and never for anyone s personal benefit. We respect the
confidentiality of information about the Company, its customers, employees,
vendors and partners. Confidential information will not be used for personal
benefit. We comply with the laws and regulations which prohibit insider trading
of securities. We protect the intellectual property rights, including
copyrights, patents, licenses and trademarks, and other proprietary information
of the Company and others. 

Conflict
of Interest 

        We avoid
conflicts, and the appearance of conflicts, between our company responsibilities
and personal interests. We use corporate resources - time, personnel, equipment
and supplies   only for Company business or Company approved
activities. 

We do not
take personal advantage of business opportunities through the use of Company
property, information or position. The Company's directors, officers and
employees do not engage in business activities in competition with the Company.
Any potential conflict of interest must be disclosed promptly to
management. 

2 

Gifts
and Gratuities 

        We do not
accept, offer or authorize gifts, entertainment, or other favors that are not a
reasonable part of a business relationship. The acceptance of a gift or gratuity
must comply with subsidiary company policy.  We exercise hospitality
with discretion, so as not to jeopardize the integrity of those with whom we do
business. 

Political
Activities 

        We value
and encourage citizenship. Employees have the opportunity, as individuals, to
support political candidates and engage in political activities of their own
free choice. Company resources will not be used to support political candidates,
parties, or committees unless permitted by law and any such activity shall be
approved by executive management. 

Because
rules regarding gifts, gratuities and entertainment to public officials can vary
from state to state and even from agency to agency, we do not offer a gift of
any type, including meals, to any public official unless we have determined that
such a gift is appropriate and legal. 

Competitive
Practices 

        We
compete vigorously, but fairly, on the basis of price, superior services,
dependability and products. We do not enter into understandings or agreements
with competitors regarding prices, terms of sales, division of markets or
customers, or any other activity that restricts competition. 

We
conduct competitive marketing activities, including the advertising of products
and services and the gathering of competitive intelligence, fairly and
honestly. 

Financial
Integrity 

        We are
prudent in our expenditures on behalf of the Company and we record all business
transactions in accordance with accepted accounting principles. We maintain
appropriate internal controls designed to prevent or detect fraud and ensure
every accounting or financial record, and supporting data, describes the
transaction accurately without omission, concealment or falsification. Our
financial integrity commitment also extends to business transactions between
subsidiary companies to ensure all activity is properly reflected. We maintain
and retain all business records accurately and in compliance with applicable
laws and Company policy. 

We
believe in making full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
the reports we file under securities laws and in other public
communications. 

3

External
Relationships 

        We are
known by our customers for the quality and value of our services and for telling
the truth, keeping our promises, and dealing fairly and ethically with everyone.
The relationships we have established are built on trust that we must re-earn
every day. 

Our
commitment to earn trust guides our business decisions with everything we do.
This extends to our customers, and also to our employees, vendors, contractors,
regulators, stockholders, and neighbors. Southern Company seeks to always
maintain the highest standards of integrity and objectivity in our working
relationships and will not conduct business with anyone who does not operate
with integrity or who compromises the Company's values and ethical
standards. 

Duty
To Act 

        Each of
us is required to report promptly to management any activities that may be in
violation of this Code of Ethics, other company policies, or any applicable law
or regulation. When practical, our supervisors should be the first source of
assistance, but Compliance Officers and the Concerns Program are other options
for reporting suspected wrong doing. The Concerns Program can also be used to
report issues regarding questionable accounting practices, violations of
internal accounting controls or auditing matters directly to the Southern
Company Audit Committee.  Retaliation against anyone fulfilling their
duty to act will not be tolerated. 

Conclusion 

        In
Southern Company, ethics mean more than merely obeying laws and following
policies. SouthernStyle requires that we speak out when we see a violation of
the Code. It also calls on us to encourage and help others to act ethically.
Much more is expected today than ever before with regard to our ethical
standards. We should seize every opportunity to model the values and behavior
that make Southern Company a premier organization. 

No
waivers of the provisions of this Code of Ethics may be granted to employees,
officers, or board members without authorization from the appropriate compliance
officer or in certain circumstances the Southern Company Board of Directors.
Waivers will be disclosed as required by applicable law, regulation,
or  rule. 

This
policy does not create any contractual right to employment, employee benefits,
or other terms and conditions of employment.
