PART I 
    ITEM  1.    BUSINESS  
  INTRODUCTION  
  Overview  
  UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. The terms  we,   our,   us,   its,   UnitedHealth Group,  or the  Company  used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries.  
  Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.  
  UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to an array of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers and other individuals and serves the nation s active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community   State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare Global includes Amil, a health care company providing health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employer groups and individuals in Brazil, and other diversified global health businesses. 
  Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance through optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance across eight business markets: care delivery, care management, pharmacy care services, consumer engagement, distribution, health financial services, health care information technology and operational services and support. 
  Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2015, we processed one half trillion dollars in gross billed charges and we managed nearly $200 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the customers and consumers we serve. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments:  
             
    UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community   State and UnitedHealthcare Global;  
                
    OptumHealth;  
                
    OptumInsight; and  
                
    OptumRx.  
     For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, including revenues and long-lived fixed assets by geographic source, see Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements.  
  UnitedHealthcare 
  Through its health benefits offerings, UnitedHealthcare is enabling better health, helping to control rising health care costs and creating a better health care experience for its customers. UnitedHealthcare s market position is built on: 
             
    a national scale; 
                
    strong local market relationships; 
                
    the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; 
                
    service and advanced technology;  
                
    competitive medical and operating cost positions; 
                
    effective clinical engagement; 
                
    extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and

innovation for customers and consumers. 
     UnitedHealthcare utilizes Optum s capabilities to help coordinate patient care, improve affordability of medical care, analyze cost trends, manage pharmacy benefits, work with care providers more effectively and create a simpler consumer experienc  e. 
  In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include 1 million     physicians and other health care professionals and approximately 6,000 hospitals and other facilities. 
  UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under  Government Regulation  and in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
  UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual 
  UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services nationwide for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, individuals and military service members in the TRICARE west region. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual provides access to medical services for approximately 30 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners. This includes more than 190,000 employer customers across all 50 states. Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures.  
  Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees  dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees  dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual also offers a variety of insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families.  
  The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals and facilities. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual s UnitedHealth Premium        program is the longest-running physician quality and efficiency designation program in the industry, making it easier for consumers to access high-quality, cost-efficient care. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual has relationships with network care providers that integrate data and analytics, implement value-based payments and care management programs, and enable us to jointly better manage health care across populations.  
  UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual typically distributes its products through consultants or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual s distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and sales through collaboration with brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual also distributes products through wholesale agents or agencies that contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits and provide other related services to their customers. 
  UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual also distributes its products through professional employer organizations, associations, private equity relationships and, increasingly, through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. UnitedHealthcare Marketplace is a shopping platform for employers seeking to offer their employees flexibility and a choice of UnitedHealthcare plans. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual is also participating in select multi-plan exchanges that are structured to encourage consumer choice. Direct-to-consumer sales are also supported by participation in multi-carrier health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small groups through exchanges. In 2015, UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual participated in 23 individual and 12 small group state public exchanges and in 2016, will participate in individual public exchange offerings in 34 states. The Company is evaluating its level of participation in individual public exchange offerings for 2017. For more detail on our individual public exchange offerings, see Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
  UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual s diverse product portfolio offers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provides the flexibility to meet the needs of employers of all sizes, as well as the needs of individuals shopping for health benefits coverage. Cost pressures are accelerating demand for improved health care affordability and more coordinated care. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual is responding to this demand with new network and contracting constructs (such as performance incentives and benefit designs that direct more patients to higher-

performing care providers), alternative access to affordable and convenient care (such as through telehealth appointments with registered nurses and physicians) and a new consumer-responsive service model called Advocate4Me.  
  UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual offers its products through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs).     The market for health benefit products is shifting, with benefit and network offerings shaped, at least in part, by the requirements and effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation), increased employer focus on quality and employee engagement and the urgent need to align the system around value. 
  Employers are seeking to offer comprehensive health benefits that improve the health and wellness of their populations and as a result, lower overall health care costs, while improving employee satisfaction. By promoting a healthy workforce, employers can maximize productivity and lower overall health care costs. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual offers affordable products and actionable information to enable better health outcomes and to help employers attract and retain talent. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual s major product families include: 
  Traditional Products.   Traditional products include a full range of medical benefits and network options from managed plans, such as Choice and Options PPO, to more traditional indemnity products. The plans offer a full spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection. 
  Consumer Engagement Products.   Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase individuals  responsibility for their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer engagement services such as personalized behavioral incentive programs and consumer education. During 2015, nearly 35,000 employer-sponsored benefit plans, including nearly 400 employers in the large group self-funded market, purchased HRA or HSA products from us.  
  Clinical and Pharmacy Products.   UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy benefits management products, which complement its service offerings by improving quality of care, engaging members and providing cost-saving options. All UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual members are provided access to clinical products that help them make better health care decisions and better use of their medical benefits, which contribute to improved health and lowered medical expenses. 
  Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on funding type (fully insured or self-funded), line of business (e.g., small business, key accounts, public sector, national accounts or individuals) and clinical need. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual s clinical programs include: 
             
    wellness programs; 
                
    decision support; 
                
    utilization management; 
                
    case and disease management;  
                
    complex condition management; 
                
    on-site programs, including Know Your Numbers (biometrics) and flu shots; 
                
    incentives to reinforce positive behavior change; 
                
    mental health/substance use disorder management; and 
                
    employee assistance programs. 
     UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual s comprehensive and integrated pharmaceutical management services promote lower costs by using formulary programs to produce better unit costs, encouraging consumers to use drugs that offer improved value and outcomes and supporting the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence through physician and consumer education programs. 
  Specialty Offerings  . UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual also delivers dental, vision, life and disability product offerings through an integrated approach, including a network of more than 22,000 vision offices and more than 80,000 dental offices, in private and retail settings. 
  UnitedHealthcare Military   Veterans.     UnitedHealthcare Military   Veterans  responsibility as a contractor is to augment the military s direct care system by providing managed care support services, provider networks, medical management, claims/enrollment administration and customer service.

     Table of Contents  

UnitedHealthcare Military   Veterans is the provider of health care services for nearly 3 million active duty and retired military service members and their families in 21 states under the Department of Defense s (DoD) TRICARE Managed Care Support contract. The contract began on April 1, 2013. The DoD is moving from three to two regions for 2017. The government intends to make a decision in the spring of 2016, for contracts to begin delivering services on or about April 1, 2017. UnitedHealthcare Military   Veterans has submitted bids to offer services under the new contracts. 
  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement 
  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services, as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues common among older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement is fully dedicated to serving this growing senior market segment, providing products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement has distinct pricing, underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated to health products and services in this market. 
  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement offers a selection of products that allow people to obtain the health coverage and services they need as their circumstances change. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement is positioned to serve seniors who find that affordable, network-based care provided through Medicare Advantage plans meets their unique health care needs. For those who prefer traditional fee-for-service Medicare, UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement offers both Medicare Supplement and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) prescription drug programs that supplement their government-sponsored Medicare by providing additional benefits and coverage options. Beneficiaries with special needs are served through UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement Dual, Chronic and Institutional Special Needs Plans (SNPs) in many markets. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement services include care management and clinical management programs, a nurse health line service, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services. 
  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement s seniors-focused care management model enables it to operate at a medical cost level below that of traditional Medicare. This model is based on more than 20 years of expertise in chronic disease care management, underpinned by a proprietary technology platform. These capabilities help improve the health and well-being of older, disabled or otherwise vulnerable individuals. For example, through UnitedHealth Group s HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed approximately 1 million in-home preventative care visits in 2015 to identify, document and help close gaps in care for seniors. 
  Premium revenues from the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services (CMS) represented   26%   of UnitedHealth Group s total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement.  
  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients: AARP, the nation s largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S. government agencies. Products are also offered through employer groups and agent channels. 
  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement s major product categories include: 
  Medicare Advantage.     UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by CMS, including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and SNPs. Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which members reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement served more than   3 million   people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2015. 
  Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account member and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our historical financial results, our quality and cost initiatives and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. Starting in 2012, and phased in through 2017, the Medicare Advantage rate structure and quality rating bonuses are changing significantly. See Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  for further information. 
  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement offers innovative care management, disease management and other clinical programs, integrating federal, state and personal funding through its continuum of Medicare Advantage products. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a  
    4 

     Table of Contents  

comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify members at high risk and allow care managers to reach out to those members and create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. 
  Medicare Part D.   UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement offers two stand-alone Medicare Part D plans: the AARP MedicareRx Preferred and the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of beneficiaries  needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2015, UnitedHealthcare enrolled more than 8 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including more than 5 million individuals in the stand-alone Medicare Part D plans and more than 3 million in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.  
  Medicare Supplement.     UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement is currently serving more than 4 million seniors  nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover the various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps that seniors are exposed to in the traditional Medicare program. 
  UnitedHealthcare Community   State 
  UnitedHealthcare Community   State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. In some cases, these premiums are subject to experience or risk adjustments. UnitedHealthcare Community   State s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, Children s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), SNPs, integrated Medicare-Medicaid plans (MMP) and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2015, UnitedHealthcare Community   State participated in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and served more than   5 million   beneficiaries. Health Reform Legislation provided for optional Medicaid expansion effective January 1, 2014. Currently, UnitedHealthcare Community   State serves people through Medicaid expansion programs in 13 states. For further discussion of the Medicaid expansion under Health Reform Legislation, see Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
  States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community   State when choosing programs for participation, including the state s commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community   State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends. 
  The primary categories of eligibility for the programs served by UnitedHealthcare Community   State and its participation are: 
             
    Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, primarily women and children - 21 markets; 
                 
    Aged, Blind and Disabled (ABD) - 19 markets; 
                 
    Medicaid Expansion - 13 markets; 
                
    Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) - 11 markets; 
                
    childless adults programs for the uninsured - 3 markets; 
                
    other programs (e.g., developmentally disabled, rehabilitative services) - 6 markets; and 
                
    MMP - 2 markets. 
     These health plans and care programs offered are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, those with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community   State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. These individuals also tend to face significant social and economic challenges. 
  UnitedHealthcare Community   State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community   State coordinates resources

among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care. 
  The LTSS market represents only 6% of the total Medicaid population, yet accounts for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The LTSS population is made up of 3 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTSS programs and represent a subset of the 16 million ABD Americans. Currently, 25% of the ABD population and 28% of the LTSS eligible population are served by comprehensive risk-based managed care programs. States are increasingly looking for solutions to not only help control costs, but to improve quality for the complex medical challenges faced by this population and are moving with greater speed to managed care programs. 
  There are more than 10 million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. MMP beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. While these individuals  health needs are more complex and more costly, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. This market provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid funding and improve people s health status through close coordination of care. While dual eligibles account for just 15% of the total Medicaid population, they account for approximately 35% of total Medicaid spending. As of December 31, 2015, UnitedHealthcare served nearly 350,000 people with complex conditions similar to those in an MMP population in legacy programs through Medicare Advantage dual SNPs and UnitedHealthcare Community   State served 24,000 people through MMP programs in Ohio and Texas. 
  UnitedHealthcare Global 
  UnitedHealthcare Global participates in international markets through national  in country  and cross-border strategic approaches.

    Those who need care: the consumers who need the right support, information, resources and products to achieve their health goals. 
                
    Those who provide care: pharmacies, hospitals, physicians  and other care providers  practices and other health care facilities seeking to modernize the health system and support the best possible patient care and experiences.

     Table of Contents  

Those who innovate for care: global life sciences organizations dedicated to developing more effective approaches to care, enabling technologies and medicines that improve care delivery and health outcomes. 
     Optum is organized in three reportable segments which focus on eight business markets to achieve its full potential for growth and leadership in the health services sector: 
             
    OptumHealth focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, distribution and health financial services; 
                
    OptumInsight delivers operational services and support and health care information technology services; and 
                
    OptumRx specializes in pharmacy care services.  
     OptumHealth 
  OptumHealth is a diversified health and wellness business serving the physical, emotional and health-related financial needs of more than 78 million unique individuals. OptumHealth enables population health management through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and, increasingly, directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth products and services deliver value by improving quality and patient satisfaction while lowering cost. OptumHealth builds high-performing networks and centers of excellence across the care continuum, by working directly with physicians to advance population health management and by coordinating care for the most medically complex patients. 
  OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, and on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee per individual served. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. 
  OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, DoD, the Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies). As provider reimbursement models evolve, care providers are emerging as a fourth market for the health management, financial services and local care delivery businesses. 
  OptumHealth is organized into two primary operating groups: OptumCare and Optum Consumer Solutions (OCS). 
  OptumCare 
             
    OptumCare partners closely with care providers to improve both the health of the populations they serve and the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of local care systems. Through networks comprised of employed, managed and contracted physicians, advanced practitioners and other providers, OptumCare assists care providers in adopting new approaches and technologies that improve collaboration and coordination among everyone involved in patient care. OptumCare also enables care providers  transition from traditional, fee-for-service care delivery to performance-based delivery and payment models that put patient health and outcomes first, such as those emerging through accountable care organizations (ACOs) and local care provider partnerships. OptumCare builds partnerships with care providers who share its focus on creating strong and sustainable new approaches to care delivery and works with them to develop and deliver services around the spectrum of patient and community needs. 
                
    Mobile Care Delivery. OptumCare s mobile care delivery business provides occupational health, medical and dental readiness services, treatments and immunization programs. These solutions serve a number of government and commercial clients, including the U.S. military. 
     OCS.  
             
    Population Health Management Services: OCS serves people through population health management services that meet both the preventative care and health intervention needs of consumers across the care continuum - physical health and wellness, mental health, complex medical conditions, disease management, hospitalization and post-acute care. This includes offering access to proprietary networks of provider specialists in many clinical specialties, including behavioral health, organ transplant, chiropractic and physical therapy. OCS engages consumers in managing their health, including guidance, tools and programs that help them achieve their health goals and maintain healthy lifestyles.  
                
    Distribution: This business provides sales and services through digital, phone and in-person interaction to assist individuals in selecting and understanding their benefits. OCS provides contact center support, multimodal software, data analysis and licensed sales agents that help clients acquire, retain and service large populations of health care consumers.

     Table of Contents  

Financial Services: This business provides a range of health care financial products for individuals, employers, health care professionals and payers. OCS is a leading provider of consumer health care accounts. OCS also offers electronic claims payment services to care providers through Optum Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with more than 3.8 million accounts and $4.2 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, Optum Bank processed more than $100 billion in medical payments to physicians and other health care providers.  
     OptumInsight 
  OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. OptumInsight s capabilities are focused on modernizing the health system through technology, analytics and information that help drive higher quality and greater efficiency in the health care system. Hospital systems, physician practices, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. 
  Many of OptumInsight s software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and outsourcing contracts are delivered over an extended period, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience with OptumInsight s customers. OptumInsight s aggregate backlog at December 31, 2015, was $10.4 billion, of which $5.9 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $3.8 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are included in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsight s aggregate backlog at December 31, 2014, was $8.6 billion. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in the backlog due to uncertainties with regard to the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation, non-renewal or early termination of service arrangements.  
  OptumInsight s products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsight s products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsight s products with their applications. 
  OptumInsight provides capabilities targeted to the needs of four primary market segments: care providers (e.g., physician practices and hospital systems), payers, governments and life sciences organizations. 
  Care Providers.   Serving five out of six U.S. hospitals and tens of thousands of physician practices, OptumInsight provides capabilities that help drive financial performance, meet compliance requirements and deliver health intelligence. OptumInsight brings an array of solutions to help care providers, with particular focus on clinical performance and quality improvement, population health management, data management and analytics, revenue management, cost containment, compliance, cloud-enabled collaboration and consumer engagement. 
  Payers.   OptumInsight serves approximately 300 health plans by helping them improve operational and administrative efficiency, understand and optimize growth while managing risk, deliver on clinical performance and compliance goals and build and manage strong provider networks. OptumInsight is also helping payer clients adapt to new market models, including health insurance exchanges, consumer-driven health care and engagement, pay-for-value contracting and population health management. 
  Governments.   OptumInsight provides services to federal and state government clients that are tailored to them as government payers, including data and analytics technology, claims management and payment accuracy services and strategic consulting. In addition, OptumInsight provides custom system integration expertise and services to meet complex government needs, including public health insurance exchanges.  
  Life Sciences.   OptumInsight provides services to global life sciences organizations. These companies look to OptumInsight for data analytics and expertise in core areas of health economics and outcomes research; market access and reimbursement consulting; integrated clinical and health care claims data and informatics services; epidemiology and drug safety; and patient reported outcomes. 
  OptumRx 
  OptumRx provides a full spectrum of pharmacy care services to more than 66 million people in the United States through its network of more than 67,000 retail pharmacies and multiple home delivery facilities throughout the country. In 2016, OptumRx expects to manage nearly $80 billion in pharmaceutical spending, including more than $28 billion in specialty pharmaceutical spending. OptumRx s pharmacy care services deliver a low-cost, high-quality pharmacy benefit through retail network contracting, including rebate management and clinical programs such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management programs.

OptumRx s comprehensive whole-person approach integrates demographic, medical, pharmaceutical and other clinical data and than applies analytics to drive clinical care insight to support care treatments and compliance, benefiting clients and individuals through enhanced services and cost trend management. These enhancements will be driven by advanced technology, augmented resources and greater efficiencies and cost containment strategies through increased scale. 
  OptumRx provides pharmacy care services to a substantial majority of UnitedHealthcare members. Additionally, OptumRx manages specialty pharmacy benefits across nearly all of UnitedHealthcare s businesses with services, including patient support and clinical programs designed to ensure quality and deliver value for consumers. OptumRx also provides pharmacy care services to non-affiliated external clients, including a number of health plans, large national employer plans, unions and 
  trusts and government entities. These clients rely on OptumRx for components or all of their pharmacy care services. OptumRx s distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants and direct sales.    
  GOVERNMENT REGULATION  
  Most of our health and well-being businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business.  
  If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. 
    
  Federal Laws and Regulation  
  We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to risk adjustment and reinsurance data.  
  UnitedHealthcare Community   State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies that are held by our Optum businesses and UnitedHealthcare Military   Veterans business, such as our TRICARE contract with the DoD. Our business is also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust.  
  Health Care Reform.   Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system.  
  Among other requirements, Health Reform Legislation expanded dependent coverage to age 26, expanded benefit requirements, eliminated certain annual and lifetime maximum limits, eliminated certain pre-existing condition limits, required coverage for preventative services without cost to members, required premium rebates if certain medical loss ratios (MLRs) are not satisfied, granted members new and additional appeal rights, created new premium rate review processes, established a system of state and federal exchanges through which consumers can purchase health coverage, imposed new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits) between health insurers and their members, introduced new risk sharing programs, reduced the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage.

     Table of Contents  

Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations are affecting how we do business and could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See also Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  for a discussion of the risks related to Health Reform Legislation and related matters. 
  Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation.   The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. ICD-10, the new system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with health care in the United States replaced ICD-9 code sets as of October 1, 2015, and health plans and providers are now required to use ICD-10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures for dates of services on or after such date. Coding informs analytics and patient care decision making, so accuracy is critical to achieving the highest quality of care and delivering the best possible outcomes for patients. 
  The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) significantly expanded the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA. HITECH imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information.  
  The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to  opt out  of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below.  
  ERISA.   The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA.  
  State Laws and Regulation  
  Health Care Regulation  .   Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where implemented by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. In 2014, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act that requires us to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. The first report was filed with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by that state s regulation, last year. It will be filed with both jurisdictions annually thereafter. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with Health Reform Legislation, which may affect our operations and our financial results. 
  Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies.

     Table of Contents  

Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, MCO, utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distributions laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community   State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts.  
  Guaranty Fund Assessments  .   Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies (including state insurance cooperatives) that write the same line or similar lines of business. Assessments are generally based on a formula relating to our premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets or through premiums. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company s claims through state guaranty association assessments. 
  Pharmacy Regulation.   OptumRx s businesses include home delivery and specialty pharmacies that must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our home delivery and specialty pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery and specialty pharmacies are located, laws and regulations in non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals may also apply, including the requirement to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery and specialty pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. As certain of our home delivery and specialty pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers, their participation in the programs requires them to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery and specialty pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. 
  State Privacy and Security Regulations.   A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations.  
  Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws.   Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. 
  Consumer Protection Laws.   Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations. 
  Banking Regulation 
  Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness  
    11 

     Table of Contents  

requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. 
  International Regulation 
  Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage.  
  COMPETITION  
  As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to contract directly with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, disease management companies and various health information and consulting companies. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, our competitors include Aetna Inc., Anthem, Inc., Centene Corporation, Cigna Corporation, Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and, with respect to our Brazilian operations, several established competitors in Brazil and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, our competitors include CVS Health Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Prime Therapeutics LLC. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We compete on the basis of the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer engagement and satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network and clinical management capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength; and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including by maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

    ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS  
  CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS 
  The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words  believe,   expect,   intend,   estimate,   anticipate,   forecast,   outlook,   plan,   project,   should  or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the  safe harbor  provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. 
  The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify.  
  If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise over 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, federal and state regulatory requirements obligate our commercial, Medicare Advantage and certain state-based Medicaid health plans to maintain minimum MLRs, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain price increases for our products. In addition, our OptumCare business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to predict accurately, price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
  We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences  
    14 

     Table of Contents  

between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2015 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1% higher, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2015 would have been reduced by approximately $210 million, excluding any offsetting impact from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. 
  In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  
  Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. 
  We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In addition, under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of  impaired or insolvent insurance companies (including state insurance cooperatives) that write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company s claims through state guaranty association assessments.  
  Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations, which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, state telemedicine regulations, debt collection laws, banking regulations, distributor and producer licensing requirements, state corporate practice of medicine doctrines, fee-splitting rules, health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. 
  The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change, and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. 
  We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases to HHS for monitoring purposes on many of our products. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our Amil business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and to  
    15 

     Table of Contents  

insurance industries and regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Ag ncia Nacional de Sa de Suplementar, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
  The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation, such as Health Reform Legislation and associated exchanges. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. 
  Health Reform Legislation could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Due to its complexity, ongoing implementation and continued legal challenges, Health Reform Legislation s full impact remains difficult to predict and could adversely affect us. For example, Health Reform Legislation includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace, including guaranteed availability of coverage, adjusted community rating requirements (which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors), essential health benefit requirements (resulting in benefit changes for many members) and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing (or a combination of both) for many policyholders. In addition, if we do not maintain certain minimum loss ratios, we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers. These changes can cause significant disruptions in local health care markets and adjustments to our business, all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
  Health Reform Legislation required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers and requires insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges to offer a minimum level of benefits and includes guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations. While risk adjustment applies to most individual and small group plans in the commercial markets, actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions. Our participation in these exchanges involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
  Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the number of  individuals who gain coverage under Health Reform Legislation varies from our expectations, if the demand for Health Reform Legislation related products and capabilities offered by our Optum businesses is less than anticipated or if our costs are greater than anticipated. For a discussion of individual exchange-compliant products, see Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
  As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs, CHIP and our TRICARE contract with the DoD, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or, as is a typical feature of many government contracts, termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
  The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members  benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost  
    16 

     Table of Contents  

management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. 
  Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
  Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of Health Reform Legislation, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among other things, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, under Health Reform Legislation, Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement MMP managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care. Health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation, including meeting certain performance requirements. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the MMP demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
  CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community   State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit. Such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. 
  We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model, our chart review programs and related processes. Such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  
  The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws,  
    17 

     Table of Contents  

regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business. While we transitioned to ICD-10 as a HIPAA-regulated entity, providers may use ICD-10 codes differently than they used ICD-9 codes in the past, which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment or increased medical costs for full-risk health insurance products.  
  Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities.  
  HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
  Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses. 
  We provide pharmacy care services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery and specialty pharmacies, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including potential new regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. 
  Our pharmacy care services businesses would be materially and adversely affected by our inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our home delivery or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
  In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pharmacy care services businesses in connection with services for which our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. 
  If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows     could be materially and adversely affected.  
  Our businesses compete throughout the United States, Brazil and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional  
    18 

     Table of Contents  

arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. In addition, our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. Additionally, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits, health care usage, and in the effective navigation of the health care system we may be challenged by new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. 
  If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected.  
  Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, distract managements  attention and result in negative publicity. 
  In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, accountable care organizations; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected.  
  We have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider, under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations.  
  Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us.  
  The success of certain businesses, including OptumCare and Amil, depend on maintaining satisfactory physician employment relationships. The primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. There is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships  
    19 

     Table of Contents  

with primary care physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and HMO competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or HMO companies, or adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. 
  In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.    
  We are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
  We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States, where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. 
  We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. 
  Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  
  As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired  
    20 

     Table of Contents  

businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.  
  Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. 
  Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants.  
  Our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants with whom we do not have exclusive contracts and for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commissions.  
  A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies  products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. 
  Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations.  
  Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans. Unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, HMOs, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum s financial results. 
  Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of   December 31, 2015  . Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income, and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and equity.  
  There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it  
    21 

     Table of Contents  

became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries.  
  If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected.  
  As of   December 31, 2015  , goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of   $53 billion  , representing   47%   of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities.  
  If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.  
  Our ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management s time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. 
  If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents, that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences.  
  We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third-parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or  
    22 

     Table of Contents  

theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human errors; or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customer s data. 
  The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of  sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers  private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business.  
  If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  
  We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  
  Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  
  Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
  Claims paying ability, financial strength and credit ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs.

     MARKET PRICES AND HOLDERS 
  Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol UNH. On January 29, 2016, there were 13,501 registered holders of record of our common stock. The per share high and low common stock sales prices reported by the NYSE and cash dividends declared for our last two fiscal years were as follows:  

DIVIDEND POLICY  
  In June 2015, our Board of Directors increased the Company s quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to an annual dividend rate of   $2.00   per share compared to the annual dividend rate of   $1.50   per share, which the Company had paid since June 2014. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. 
    ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
  In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During 2015, the Company repurchased   10.7 million   shares at an average price of   $112.45   per share, including less than one million shares at an average price of $115.01 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2015. 
    PERFORMANCE GRAPHS  
  The following two performance graphs compare our total return to stockholders with the returns of indexes of other specified companies and the S P 500 Index. The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to stockholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the S P 500 index and a customized peer group of certain   Fortune 50   companies (the    Fortune 50   Group ) for the five-year period ended   December 31, 2015  . The second graph compares our cumulative total return to stockholders with the S P 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended   December 31, 2015  . We are not included in either the   Fortune 50   Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the   Fortune 50   Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2010 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid.

  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  
  General 
  UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct  
    27 

     Table of Contents  

platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services. 
  We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: 
             
    UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community   State and UnitedHealthcare Global; 
                
    OptumHealth; 
                
    OptumInsight; and 
                
    OptumRx. 
     Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1,  Business  and in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements.  
  Business Trends 
  Our businesses participate in the United States, Brazilian and certain other international health economies. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. 
  Pricing Trends  . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations. Our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum MLR thresholds and the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions that impact the small group and individual markets. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions.  
  The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group markets. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Health Reform Legislation included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. Health Reform Legislation also included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets (Premium Stabilization Programs): a permanent risk adjustment program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a transitional reinsurance program (Reinsurance Program). Health plans have generally reflected the Health Insurance Industry Tax and Reinsurance Program (together, ACA Fees) in their pricing. Conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. In 2015, health plans  pricing returned to a more normal year-over-year inflation after pricing for higher costs due to ACA Fees in 2014. As always, the intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. This will impact our pricing for contracts that renew during 2016 but cover all or portions of 2017. 
  Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in  Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.   
  We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the reimbursement rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid net margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. 
  Medical Cost Trends.   Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. Consistent with our experience in recent years, our 2015 cost trends were largely driven by unit cost pressures from health care providers. In 2016, we expect continued unit cost pressure and a modest increase in utilization. We endeavor to mitigate those increases with medical management. Our 2016 management activities include managing costs across all health care categories, including specialty pharmacy spending, as new therapies are introduced at high costs and older drugs have unexpected price increases. 
  Delivery System and Payment Modernization.   The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to  
    28 

     Table of Contents  

work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider reimbursement models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. 
  We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2015, we served more than 14 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2015, our contracts with value-based spending total nearly $46 billion annually, up from $13 billion in 2011. 
  This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform.  
  Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties 
  Following is a summary of management s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items. For additional information regarding Health Reform Legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1  Business - Government Regulation  and Item 1A,  Risk Factors.  
  Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios.   Medicare Advantage rates have been cut over the last several years, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017. The final 2016 Medicare Advantage rates were more stable than in recent years, with an expected average increase in industry funding of approximately 1.25%. However, these rates still trail the typical industry forward medical cost trend of 3% which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The impact of these cuts to our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. These factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our Medicare Advantage plans for 2016. 
  The ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate reductions. These adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. 
  In the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. As Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings.  
  Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans  star ratings. The level of star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plan s membership and revenue. Beginning in 2015, quality bonus payments were paid only to plans rated 4 stars and higher. We expect that approximately 56% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2016 compared with approximately 39% of members in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2015. We further expect that at least 63% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2017. We continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance. 
  Health Insurance Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs.   The industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax was $11.3 billion in 2015 and will remain at that level in 2016. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017, on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. The Health Insurance Industry Tax will again be imposed for 2018 and beyond. In 2016, we expect that our share of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will increase to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion in 2015 due to growth in our business.  
  The Reinsurance Program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business, including insured and self-funded arrangements. The total three year amount of $25 billion for the Reinsurance  
    29 

     Table of Contents  

Program is allocated as follows: $20 billion (2014 - $10 billion, 2015 - $6 billion, 2016 - $4 billion) subject to increases based on state decisions, to fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion (2014 and 2015 - $2 billion, 2016 - $1 billion) to fund the U.S. Treasury. The actual 2014 Reinsurance Program contributions totaled approximately $9.7 billion, which was $2.3 billion short of the expected amount; all was used to fund the Reinsurance Program. While funding for the Reinsurance Program will come from all commercial lines of business, only market reform compliant individual businesses will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. We have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds. 
  For detail on the Health Insurance Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements.  
  Individual Public Exchanges.   After a measured approach to the individual public exchange market in 2014 in which we participated in only four states, we expanded significantly in 2015 to participate in 23 states. In 2016, we are expanding our individual public exchange offerings by 11 states to a total of 34 states. Recent data, however, has caused us to reconsider our long-term position in the individual public exchange market. We have seen lower consumer participation than we and others expected, lower government expectations for future consumer participation, declining performance in and accelerating failures of government-sponsored cooperatives and worsening of our own claims experience. We have recorded a premium deficiency reserve for a portion of our estimated 2016 losses in our 2015 results for in-force contracts as of January 1, 2016. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions (e.g., increased prices and eliminated marketing and commissions) to contain membership growth. By mid-2016 we will determine to what extent, if any, we will continue to offer products in the individual public exchange market in 2017.

On July 23, 2015, we acquired Catamaran through the purchase of all of its outstanding common stock for cash. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8  Financial Statements  for more information. 
     2015 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2014 RESULTS 
  Our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 were affected by our acquisition of Catamaran on July 23, 2015. 
  Consolidated Financial Results 
  Revenues 
  The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the effect of the Catamaran acquisition and organic growth in the number of individuals served across our benefits businesses and across all of Optum s businesses.  
  Medical Costs 
  Medical costs increased primarily due to risk-based membership growth in our benefits businesses. Medical costs also included losses on individual exchange-compliant products related to 2015, and the establishment of premium deficiency reserves related to the 2016 policy year for anticipated future losses for in-force individual exchange-compliant contracts and a new state Medicaid contract. 
  Operating Cost Ratio 
  The decrease in our operating cost ratio was due to the inclusion of Catamaran and growth in government benefits programs, both of which have lower operating cost ratios and Company wide productivity gains. 
  Reportable Segments 
  See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements  for more information on our segments. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information:

UnitedHealthcare 
  The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: 

The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement:   

  The increase in commercial risk-based enrollment was the result of strong participation in UnitedHealthcare s individual public exchange products and favorable annual renewal activity and new business wins in the employer group segment. Medicare Advantage participation increased year-over-year primarily due to growth in people served through employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Medicaid growth was driven by the combination of health reform related Medicaid expansion, states launching new programs to complement established programs and growth in established programs, partially offset by a decrease of 175,000 people in one market where an additional offering was introduced by the state in the first quarter of 2015. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. The number of people served internationally decreased year-over-year primarily due to pricing and underwriting disciplines in Brazil in response to regulatory actions and declining employment levels in Brazil. 
  UnitedHealthcare s revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends.  
  UnitedHealthcare s operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased as the combined individual exchange-compliant losses and premium deficiency reserves totaling $815 million more than offset strong growth across the business, improved medical cost management and increased productivity.  
  Optum 
  Total revenues and operating earnings increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by double-digit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below. 
    33 

       Table of Contents  

The results by segment were as follows: 
  OptumHealth 
  Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to growth in its care delivery businesses and the impact of acquisitions in patient care centers and population health management services. The operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to investments made to develop future growth opportunities. 
  OptumInsight 
  Revenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased primarily due to expansion and growth in care provider revenue management services and payer services.  
  OptumRx 
  Revenue and earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to the mid-year acquisition of Catamaran as well as strong organic growth. Operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased slightly due to the inclusion of lower margin Catamaran business. For more information about Catamaran, see Note 3 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8  Financial Statements.  
  2014 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2013 RESULTS 
  Consolidated Financial Results 
  Revenues 
  The increases in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses and growth across all of Optum s businesses. 
  Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio 
  Medical costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses. To the extent possible, we included the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing; since the ACA Fees are included in operating costs, this decreased our medical care ratio in 2014. This decrease from ACA Fees was partially offset by the impact of lower levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. 
  Operating Cost Ratio 
  The increase in our operating cost ratio during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the introduction of ACA Fees and services business growth and acquisitions, partially offset by productivity and operating performance gains. 
  Income Tax Rate 
  The increase in our income tax rate resulted primarily from the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax.  
  Reportable Segments 
  UnitedHealthcare 
  UnitedHealthcare s revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses; revenues to recover ACA Fees, which resulted in $1.5 billion of additional annual premiums in 2014; and commercial price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. These increases were partially offset by decreased commercial risk-based enrollment and a reduced level of Medicare Advantage funding. 
  UnitedHealthcare s operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 were pressured year-over-year by ACA Fees, Medicare Advantage funding reductions, increased spending on specialty medications to treat hepatitis C and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Partially offsetting these factors were growth in our public and senior markets businesses, reduced levels of per-member inpatient hospital utilization and revenue true-ups. 
  Optum 
  Total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to pharmacy growth at OptumRx and growth at OptumHealth. 
  The increases in Optum s earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven by revenue growth and increased productivity, partially offset by investments at OptumHealth and OptumInsight. 
    34 

       Table of Contents  

The results by segment were as follows: 
  OptumHealth 
  Revenue increased at OptumHealth during 2014 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in care delivery and subacute care services. 
  Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to revenue growth and cost efficiencies, offset in part by investments to develop future growth opportunities. 
  OptumInsight 
  Revenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to the growth and expansion in revenue management services and government exchange services, partially offset by a reduction in hospital compliance services and investments for future growth. 
  OptumRx 
  Increased OptumRx revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in people served in UnitedHealthcare s public and senior markets, the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare s commercial pharmacy benefit programs, growth from external clients and an increase in specialty pharmaceutical revenues. 
  Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to growth in scale that resulted in greater productivity and better absorption of our fixed costs and improved performance in both drug purchasing and home delivery pharmacy fulfillment. 
    LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Liquidity 
  Introduction 
  We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses.  
  Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. 
  In 2015, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.4 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.6 billion. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements  for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. 
  Our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our stockholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents 

2015 Cash Flows Compared to 2014 Cash Flows 
  Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 increased primarily due to growth in risk-based products, which increased medical costs payable and an increase in CMS risk share payables, which increased other policy liabilities. These increases were partially offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates, which increased other receivables, the increase in the payment of the 2015 Health Insurance Industry Tax and the payment of Reinsurance Program fees in 2015. 
  Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased cash paid for acquisitions and net debt issuances and decreased share repurchases, all due to the Catamaran acquisition. 
  2014 Cash Flows Compared to 2013 Cash Flows 
  Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 increased primarily due to an increased level of accounts payable and other liabilities, including the collection of Reinsurance Program fees in advance of remittance in 2015, partially offset by an increase in government receivables. 
  Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included: (a) a change in investment activity from net purchases in 2013 to net sales in 2014; (b) an increase in Part D subsidy receivables causing a change in customer funds administered; and (c) increased levels of cash used to repurchase common stock. 
  Financial Condition 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of   $31.2 billion   included   $10.9 billion   of cash and cash equivalents (of which   $286 million   was available for general corporate use),   $18.6 billion   of debt securities and   $1.6 billion   of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during  
    36 

     Table of Contents  

adverse market conditions. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements  for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. 
  Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.4 years and a weighted-average credit rating of  AA  as of   December 31, 2015  . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. 
  Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity 
  In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: 
  Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities.   Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements.  
  Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-stockholders  equity ratio of not more than 55%. As of December 31, 2015, our debt to debt-plus-stockholders  equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 47%. 
  Long-Term Debt.   Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. In July 2015, we issued debt to fund the acquisition of Catamaran. For more information on this debt issuance, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8  Financial Statements.  
  Credit Ratings.   Our credit ratings as of   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. 
  Share Repurchase Program.   We expect continued moderated share repurchase activity through 2016 following the acquisition of Catamaran. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements.  
  Dividends.   In June 2015, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to an annual dividend rate of   $2.00   per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS 
  The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2015, under our various contractual obligations and commitments:  

(a) 
    Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements  for more detail.  
              (b) 
    Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2015  .  
              (c) 
    Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements  for more detail.  
              (d) 
    As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as  Thereafter.  
              (e) 
    Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as  Thereafter.  
              (f) 
    Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments.  
              (g) 
    Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. 
     We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. 
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  As of December 31, 2015, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  
  See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8  Financial Statements  for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. 
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.

     Table of Contents  

Medical Costs Payable 
  Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of   December 31, 2015  , our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days.  
  Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2015, 2014 and 2013 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of   $320 million  ,   $420 million   and   $680 million  , respectively. 
  In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.  
  Completion Factors.   Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. 
  The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of   December 31, 2015  :       

  Medical Cost PMPM Trend Factors.   Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic  
    39 

     Table of Contents  

variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics.  
  The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of   December 31, 2015  :  

The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims.  
  Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of   December 31, 2015  , developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of   December 31, 2015  ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our   December 31, 2015   estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2015 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $83 million.  
  Revenues  
  We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services.  
  Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS  retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements  for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us to CMS.  
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
  Goodwill.   Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of October 1, 2015. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. During 2015, we changed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 of each year. The change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of our long-term planning process, which is a significant input to the testing. This change in testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid a goodwill impairment charge. Impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.  
    40 

     Table of Contents  

To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. 
  We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. 
  Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: 
             
    Revenue trends.   Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. 
                
    Medical cost trends.   For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the  Medical Cost Trend  section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the  Medical Costs Payable  critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level.  
                
    Operating productivity.   We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. 
                
    Capital levels.   The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. 
     Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty.  
  The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units  operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. 
  Intangible Assets.   Our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and were initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis.  
  Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset s (or asset group s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors.  
  Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2015. 
  Investments  
  Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments.  
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Assessment.     Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve (Fed) announced that it would increase short- 
    41 

     Table of Contents  

term interest rates to a range between 25 and 50 basis points. Fed officials emphasized that they intend to raise rates gradually, if necessary. We estimate a 25 basis point rise in short-term interest rates impacts the fair-value of our investments by $200 million. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. 
  The judgments and estimates related to other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors, including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop.  
  LEGAL MATTERS 
  A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements.   
  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
  Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of   December 31, 2015  , we had a reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements.   for more information. As of   December 31, 2015  , there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. 
    ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real. 
  As of December 31, 2015, we had $12.9 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2015, $12.9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. 
  The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, $17.1 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $21.9 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. 
  We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income. 
    42 

     Table of Contents  

The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of   December 31, 2015   and 2014 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):   

  nm = not meaningful 
           (a) 
    Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of   December 31, 2015   and 2014, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful. 
              (b) 
    As of   December 31, 2015   and 2014, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. 
              (c) 
    The year over year change in the fair value of financial liabilities was driven by the issuance of debt to fund the Catamaran acquisition. For more information on our debt issuances, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
     We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of Amil s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amil s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income.  
  An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $300 million and $660 million, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies. 
  As of December 31, 2015, we had   $1.6 billion   of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. Valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries:  
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in   Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
             1. 
    Description of Business 
     UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries,  UnitedHealth Group  and  the Company ) is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. 
  Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system.  
    2.   Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.  
  Use of Estimates 
  These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company s best estimates and judgments. The Company s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimates of other policy liabilities and other current receivables and valuations of certain investments. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. 
  Reclassification 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company changed its accounting policy for the presentation of certain pharmacy fulfillment costs related to its OptumRx business. These costs are now included in medical costs and cost of products sold, whereas they were previously included in operating costs. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification increased medical expenses by   $376 million   and   $369 million  , decreased operating costs by   $418 million   and   $421 million   and increased cost of products sold by   $42 million   and   $52 million   for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The reclassification had no impact on total operating costs, earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity. 
  Reincorporation 
  On July 1, 2015, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated changed its state of incorporation from Minnesota to Delaware pursuant to a plan of conversion. The reincorporation was approved by the Company s stockholders at its 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 1, 2015. Upon reincorporation, the affairs of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated became subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, a new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws, and each previously outstanding share of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated s common stock as a Minnesota corporation (UNH Minnesota) converted into an outstanding share of common stock of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated as a Delaware corporation after the reincorporation (UNH Delaware). The reincorporation was a tax-free reorganization under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and did not affect the Company s business operations. 
  Revenues  
  Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers  health care and related administrative costs.  
  Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation) and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Additionally, the Company s market reform compliant individual and small group plans in the commercial markets are subject to risk adjustment provisions as discussed in  Premium Stabilization Programs   below.  
    51 

     Table of Contents  

Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. 
  The Company s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  (CMS) risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of the Company s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 13 for additional information regarding these audits.  
  For the Company s OptumRx pharmacy care services business, revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery and specialty pharmacy facilities, and from administrative services, including claims processing and formulary design and management. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Company s mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the member s applicable co-payment. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Company s mail-service pharmacy. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. The Company has entered into retail service contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless if the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors  members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. 
  Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees  dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the period the related services are performed. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees  dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For both risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. 
  Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable  
  Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company s obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the medical costs payable estimates recorded in prior periods develop, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Medical costs also include the direct cost of patient care. 
  Cost of Products Sold  
  The Company s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its mail and specialty pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. 
    52 

     Table of Contents  

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments  
  Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments.  
  Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available.  
  The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.  
  The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Company s intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost.  
  New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company s investment policy.  
  Assets Under Management  
  The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age and other related products.  
  Pursuant to the Company s agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from its general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. 
  The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For more detail on the RSF, see  Other Policy Liabilities  below. 
  Other Current Receivables  
  Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, reinsurance and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company.  
  The Company s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers  products by its affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and records rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates from two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. 
  For details on the Company s Medicare Part D receivables see  Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits  below.  
  For details on the Company s reinsurance receivable see  Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable  below.

     Table of Contents  

Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits 
  The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are seven separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows:  
             
    CMS Premium.   CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year.  
                
    Member Premium.   Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year.  
                
    Low-Income Premium Subsidy.   For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the member s monthly premiums to the Company on the member s behalf.  
                
    Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy  . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year.  
                
    Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy.   For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the member s behalf some or all of a member s cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year.  
                
    CMS Risk-Share.   Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Company s annual bids by product and region to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience to date. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including estimates of eligible pharmacy costs and member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and other policy liabilities or other current receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
                
    Drug Discount.   Health Reform Legislation mandated a consumer discount on brand name prescription drugs for Medicare Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This discount is funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while the Company administers the application of these funds. Accordingly, amounts received are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. The Company records a liability when amounts are received from CMS and a receivable when the Company bills the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Related cash flows are presented as customer funds administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
     The CMS Premium, the Member Premium and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Company s insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and, therefore, are recorded as premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in unearned revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy (Subsidies) represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. Amounts received for these Subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as receivables and/or deposits. Related cash flows are presented as customer funds administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Pharmacy benefit costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in medical costs and operating costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  The final 2015 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2016, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS.  
  The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program:

Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software  
  Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development.  
  The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are:  
                 Furniture, fixtures and equipment 
    3 to 7 years 
      Buildings 
    35 to 40 years 
      Capitalized software 
    3 to 5 years 

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. 
  Goodwill  
  To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. First, the Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. 
  During 2015, the Company changed its annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 of each year. The change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of the Company s long-term planning process, which is a significant input to the testing. This change in testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid a goodwill impairment charge. 
  There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Intangible Assets 
  The Company s intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company s indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities 
  The Company had checks outstanding of   $1.6 billion   and   $1.4 billion   as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were classified as accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the change in this balance has been reflected within other financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  As of both December 31, 2015 and 2014, accounts payable and accrued liabilities included accrued payroll liabilities of   $1.5 billion  . 
  Other Policy Liabilities  
  Other policy liabilities include the RSF associated with the AARP Program, health savings account deposits, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see  Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits  above), accruals for premium rebate payments under Health Reform Legislation, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. At the customer s option, these balances may be refunded or used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts.  
  Changes in the RSF are reported in medical costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of   December 31, 2015   and 2014, the balance in the RSF was   $1.6 billion   and   $1.5 billion  , respectively. 
  Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable 
  Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result of the 2005 sale of the life and annuity business within the Company s Golden Rule Financial Corporation subsidiary under an indemnity

reinsurance arrangement, the Company has maintained a liability associated with the reinsured contracts, as it remains primarily liable to the policyholders, and has recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable due from the purchaser. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with Golden Rule as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:  

The Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and only records the reinsurance receivable to the extent of probable recovery. As of   December 31, 2015  , the reinsurer was rated by A.M. Best as  A+.   
  Policy Acquisition Costs 
  The Company s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer 
  with at least   30   days  notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to 
  expense as incurred. 
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
  Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests activity for the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  : 

Share-Based Compensation 
  The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably; primarily over   two   to   five   years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably primarily over   four   to   six   years and may be exercised up to   10   years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company s stock at a discounted price, which is   85%   of the lower market price of the Company s common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Net Earnings Per Common Share  
  The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common stockholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common stockholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP, (collectively, common stock equivalents) using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise, any unrecognized compensation cost and any related excess tax benefit. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.

Health Insurance Industry Tax 
  Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. 
  The Company estimates its liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax based on a ratio of the Company s applicable net premiums written compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total applicable net premiums, both for the previous calendar year. The Company records in full the estimated liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax at the beginning of the calendar year with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using a straight-line method of allocation over the calendar year. The liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the corresponding deferred cost is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In September 2015, the Company paid its full year 2015 Health Insurance Industry Tax of   $1.8 billion  . There was no liability or asset related to the Health Insurance Industry Tax recorded as of both December 31, 2015 and 2014 as the Health Insurance Industry Tax was paid in September of both years and the asset was fully expensed by each year end. 
  Premium Stabilization Programs 
  Health Reform Legislation has included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets (Premium Stabilization Programs): a permanent risk adjustment program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a transitional reinsurance program (Reinsurance Program). 
  The risk-adjustment provisions apply to market reform compliant individual and small group plans in the commercial markets. Under the program, each covered member is assigned a risk score based upon demographic information and applicable diagnostic codes from the current year paid claims, in order to determine an average risk score for each plan in a particular state and market risk pool. Generally, a plan with a risk score that is less than the state s average risk score will pay into the pool, while a plan with a risk score that is greater than the state s average will receive money from the pool. The temporary risk corridors provisions are intended to limit the gains and losses of individual and small group qualified health plans. Plans are required to calculate the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) risk corridor ratio of allowable costs to the defined target amount. Qualified health plans with ratios below 97% are required to make payments to HHS, while plans with ratios greater than 103% expect to receive funds from HHS. The Reinsurance Program is a transitional three year program through 2016 that is funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business, including insured and self-funded arrangements.  
  For the Premium Stabilization Programs, the Company records a receivable or payable as an adjustment to premium revenue based on year-to-date experience when the amounts are reasonably estimable and collection is reasonably assured. Final adjustments or recoverable amounts to the Premium Stabilization Programs are determined by HHS in the year following the policy year.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  (ASU 2014-09) as modified by ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.  ASU 2014-09 will supersede existing revenue recognition standards with a single model unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., an insurance entity s insurance contracts). The revenue recognition principle in ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, new and enhanced disclosures will be required. Companies can adopt the new standard either using the full retrospective approach, a modified retrospective approach with practical expedients, or a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption at the original effective date, for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, will be permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new revenue recognition guidance.   
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740)  (ASU 2015-17). ASU 2015-17 requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent on a classified balance sheet. ASU -2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods after December 15, 2016 and companies are permitted to apply ASU 2015-17 either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption of ASU 2015-17 is permitted. The Company plans to early adopt ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis in the first quarter of 2016.  
  The Company has determined that there have been no other recently issued or adopted accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.        Business Combination 
    
  On July 23, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Catamaran Corporation (Catamaran) and funded Catamaran s payoff of its outstanding debt and credit facility for a total of   $14.3 billion   in cash. This combination diversifies OptumRx s customer and business mix, while enhancing OptumRx s technology capabilities and flexible service offerings. Catamaran offers pharmacy benefits management services similar to OptumRx to a broad client portfolio, including health plans and employers serving   35 million   people, and provides health care information technology solutions to the pharmacy benefits management industry. 
  The Company paid for the acquisition primarily with the proceeds of new indebtedness. Debt issuances included   $10.5 billion   of senior unsecured notes, approximately   $2.4 billion   of commercial paper and a   $1.5 billion   term loan. The total consideration exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by   $15.6 billion  , of which   $5.4 billion   has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and   $10.2 billion   to goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.

The results of operations and financial condition of Catamaran have been included in the Company s consolidated results and the results of the OptumRx segment as of July 23, 2015. Through December 31, 2015, the Catamaran business has generated   $12.4 billion   in revenue and had an immaterial impact on net earnings. 
  Unaudited pro forma revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as if the acquisition of Catamaran had occurred on January 1, 2014 were   $172 billion   and   $152 billion  , respectively. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on net earnings were immaterial for both years.

4.    Investments 
  A summary of short-term and long-term investments by major security type is as follows: 

Nearly all of the Company s investments in mortgage-backed securities were rated AAA as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of   December 31, 2015  , by contractual maturity, were as follows:   

    59 

       Table of Contents  

The fair value of available-for-sale investments with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: 

The Company s unrealized losses from all securities as of   December 31, 2015   were generated from approximately   11,000   positions out of a total of   24,000   positions. The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting neither a significant deterioration since purchase nor other factors leading to an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary.  
  The Company s investments in equity securities consist of investments in Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds, employee savings plan related investments, venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks. The Company evaluated its investments in equity securities for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors.

    5.    Fair Value 
  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.  
  The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: 
  Level 1     Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets.  
  Level 2     Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: 
             
    Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; 
                
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); 
                
    Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and 
                
    Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. 
     Level 3     Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. 
  Transfers between levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurs; there were   no   transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 of any financial assets or liabilities during   2015   or   2014  . 
  Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended   December 31, 2015   or   2014  . 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents.   The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. 
  Debt and Equity Securities.   Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to  
    61 

     Table of Contents  

determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. 
  Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2.  
  Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices.  
  The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using a market valuation technique that relies heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Under the market approach, the fair values of the Company s various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The Company s market modeling utilizes, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries that also have similar revenue and growth characteristics and preferences in their capital structure. Key significant unobservable inputs in the market technique include implied earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples and revenue multiples. Additionally, the fair values of certain of the Company s venture capital securities are based on recent transactions in inactive markets for identical or similar securities. Significant changes in any of these inputs could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements.  
  Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. 
  Other Assets.   The fair values of the Company s other assets are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company s investments in debt securities. 
  AARP Program-Related Investments.   AARP Program-related investments consist of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Company s investments in debt and equity securities. 
  Interest Rate Swaps.   Fair values of the Company s swaps are estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available information, including market yield curves. Because the swaps are unique and not actively traded but are valued using other observable inputs, the fair values are classified as Level 2. 
  Long-Term Debt.   The fair values of the Company s long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company s investments in debt securities. 
  AARP Program-Related Other Liabilities.   AARP Program-related other liabilities consist of liabilities that represent the amount of net investment gains and losses related to AARP Program-related investments that accrue to the benefit of the AARP policyholders.

     Estimated full year amortization expense relating to intangible assets for each of the next five years ending December 31 is as follows:   

  Amortization expense relating to intangible assets for December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was   $650 million  ,   $524 million   and   $519 million  , respectively.  
    8.    Medical Costs Payable 
  The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the years ended December 31:  

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the favorable medical cost reserve development was due to a number of individual factors that were not material  .   The net favorable development for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels.

9.     Commercial Paper and Long-Term Debt  
  Commercial paper, term loan and senior unsecured long-term debt consisted of the following:   

           (a) 
    Fixed-rate debt instruments hedged with interest rate swap contracts. See below for more information on the Company s interest rate swaps. 
              (b) 
    The Company terminated the interest rate swap contracts on these hedged instruments during the year ended December 31, 2015. See below for more information on this termination. 
              (c) 
    Debt issued to fund the Catamaran acquisition. For more detail on Catamaran, see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
     The Company s long-term debt obligations also included   $164 million   and   $150 million   of other financing obligations, of which   $47 million   and   $34 million   were current as of   December 31, 2015   and 2014, respectively.

       Table of Contents  

Maturities of commercial paper and long-term debt for the years ending December 31 are as follows:    

  Commercial Paper and Revolving Bank Credit Facilities 
  Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted-average annual interest rate of   0.7%  . 
  The Company has   $3.0 billion   five-year,   $2.0 billion   three-year and   $1.0 billion   364-day revolving bank credit facilities with   23   banks, which mature in   December 2020  ,   December 2018  , and   November 2016  , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of   December 31, 2015  , no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of   December 31, 2015  , annual interest rates would have ranged from   1.2%   to   1.7%  . 
  Debt Covenants 
  The Company s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-stockholders  equity ratio of not more than   55%  . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Interest Rate Swap Contracts 
  The Company uses interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its interest rate exposure from fixed rates to floating rates to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on its variable rate financial assets. The floating rates are benchmarked to LIBOR. The swaps are designated as fair value hedges on the Company s fixed-rate debt. Since the critical terms of the swaps match those of the debt being hedged, they are considered to be highly effective hedges and all changes in the fair values of the swaps are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the related debt with no net impact recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Both the hedge fair value changes and the offsetting debt adjustments are recorded in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the location and fair value of the interest rate swap fair value hedges on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet: 

During 2015, the Company terminated   $5.2 billion   notional amount of its interest rate swap fair value hedges. The resulting gain was not material.

    10.    Income Taxes  
  The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended     December 31 are as follows: 

The reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: 

The higher tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to the increase in the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax. 
    
    70 

     Table of Contents  

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows: 

Valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of   $122 million   expire beginning in 2021 through 2035; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2016 through 2035. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods.  
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had   $459 million   of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested in non-U.S. operations. Because these earnings are considered permanently reinvested, no U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these earnings. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. 
    71 

     Table of Contents  

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows:    

  The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by   $137 million   as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain major jurisdictions. 
  The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statement of Operations. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company recognized   $11 million  ,   $6 million   and   $4 million   of interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had   $59 million   and   $33 million   of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above.  
  The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2014 and prior. The Company s 2015 tax year is under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2008 tax year. The Brazilian federal revenue service - Secretaria da Receita Federal (SRF) may audit the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries for a period of five years from the date on which corporate income taxes should have been paid and/or the date when the tax return was filed. 
    11.    Stockholders' Equity 
  Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions 
  The Company s regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as  ordinary dividends  and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an  extraordinary dividend  and must receive prior regulatory approval.  
  For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of   $4.4 billion  , including   $1.5 billion   of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company s regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of   $4.6 billion  , including   $1.5 billion   of extraordinary dividends. As of December 31, 2015,   $286 million   of the Company s   $10.9 billion   of cash and cash equivalents was available for general corporate use. 
  The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately   $15.3 billion   as of December 31, 2015. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately   $8.6 billion   as of December 31, 2015. 
  Optum Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered  Well Capitalized  under the capital adequacy rules to  
    72 

    which it is subject. At December 31, 2015, the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered  Well Capitalized.  
  Share Repurchase Program 
  Under its Board of Directors  authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to stockholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2014, the Board renewed the Company s share repurchase program with an authorization to 
  repurchase up to   100 million   shares of its common stock. During 2015, the Company repurchased   10.7 million   shares at an average price of   $112.45   per share and an aggregate cost of   $1.2 billion  . As of December 31, 2015, the Company had Board authorization to purchase up to   61 million   shares of its common stock.  
  Dividends 
  In June 2015, the Company s Board of Directors increased the Company s quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to equal an annual dividend rate of   $2.00   per share compared to the annual dividend rate of   $1.50   per share, which the Company had paid since June 2014. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. 
  The following table provides details of the Company s dividend payments: 

12.    Share-Based Compensation 
  In June 2015, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (Plan). The approved amendment increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan by   70 million   and removed certain limits in the Plan. The Company s outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   85 million   shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan. As of   December 31, 2015  , there were also   12 million   shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP.

Share-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates 
  The principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options and SARs were as follows: 

Risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns.

Other Employee Benefit Plans  
  The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2015, 2014 and 2013. 
    
  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were   $553 million   and   $496 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  
    
    13.    Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was   $555 million  ,   $449 million   and   $438 million  , respectively.  
  As of December 31, 2015, future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:  

The Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.  
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of   $30 million   and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of   $1.1 billion  , primarily to bond contractual performance.  
  Legal Matters 
  Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. 
  The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. 
  Litigation Matters 
  California Claims Processing Matter.     On January 25, 2008, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations related to an alleged failure to include certain language in standard claims correspondence, timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, care provider contract implementation, care provider dispute resolution and other related matters. Although the Company believes that CDI had never before issued a fine in excess of   $8  
    75 

     Table of Contents  

million  , CDI advocated a fine of approximately   $325 million   in this matter. The matter was the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge beginning in December 2009, and in August 2013, the administrative law judge issued a nonbinding proposed decision recommending a fine of   $11.5 million  . The California Insurance Commissioner rejected the administrative law judge s recommendation and on June 9, 2014, issued his own decision imposing a fine of approximately   $174 million  . On July 10, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit in California state court challenging the Commissioner s decision. On September 8, 2015, in the first phase of that lawsuit, the California state court issued an order invalidating certain of the regulations the Commissioner had relied upon in issuing his decision and penalty. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the procedural status of the dispute, the wide range of possible outcomes, the legal issues presented (including the legal basis for the majority of the alleged violations), the inherent difficulty in predicting a regulatory fine in the event of a remand, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review that remain available to the Company. 
  Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews 
  The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Ag ncia Nacional de Sa de Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Company s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other things, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. The Company has produced documents, information and witnesses to the Department of Justice in cooperation with a current review of the Company s risk-adjustment processes, including the Company s patient chart review and related programs. CMS has selected certain of our local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans. 
  The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from any material government investigations, audits and reviews in which it is currently involved given the status of the reviews, the wide range of possible outcomes and inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory action, fines and penalties, if any, the Company s legal and factual defenses and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event of an adverse finding. 
  Guaranty Fund Assessments 
  Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies (including state health insurance cooperatives) that write the same line or similar lines of business. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), neither of which is affiliated with the Company, in rehabilitation and petitioned a state court for approval to liquidate Penn Treaty. In 2012, the court denied the liquidation petition and ordered the Insurance Commissioner to submit a rehabilitation plan. The court held a hearing in July 2015 to begin its consideration of the latest proposed rehabilitation plan. The hearing is scheduled to continue in the spring of 2016. 
  If the current proposed rehabilitation plan, which contemplates the partial liquidation of Penn Treaty, is approved by the court, the Company s insurance entities and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of Penn Treaty s policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments. The Company continues to vigorously challenge the proposed rehabilitation plan. The Company is currently unable to estimate losses or ranges of losses because the Company cannot predict when or to what extent Penn Treaty will ultimately be liquidated, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of any associated guaranty fund assessments or the availability and amount of any premium tax and other potential offsets. 
     14.    Segment Financial Information 
  Factors used to determine the Company s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes that operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined.  
    76 

     Table of Contents  

The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company s   four   reportable segments derives its revenues: 
             
    UnitedHealthcare   includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community   State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer   Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide and active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community   State s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Children s Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits. 
                
    OptumHealth   serves the physical, emotional and financial needs of individuals, enabling population health management and local care delivery through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and relationship management and sales distribution platform services and financial services. 
                
    OptumInsight   is a health care information, technology, operational services and consulting company providing software and information products, advisory consulting services and business process outsourcing services and support to participants in the health care industry. Hospitals, physicians, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system use OptumInsight to reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance and adapt to the changing health system landscape.  
                
    OptumRx   offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail pharmacy network management services, home delivery and specialty pharmacy services, manufacturer rebate contracting and administration, benefit plan design and consultation, claims processing and a variety of clinical programs such as formulary management and compliance, drug utilization review and disease and drug therapy management services.  
     The Company s accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at management s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital.  
  As a percentage of the Company s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were   26%   for 2015, and   29%   for both 2014 and 2013, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare   Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately   96%  ,   95%   and   95%   of consolidated total revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately   81%   and   73%   of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2015  
  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries  (the  Company ) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
  Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in   Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)  . Management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting of the Catamaran Corporation (Catamaran) acquisition. Such exclusion was in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition. We acquired Catamaran during July 2015. Catamaran represented 16% of our consolidated total assets and 8% of our consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.  
   The Company s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 9A.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries:  
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2015, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Catamaran Corporation (Catamaran), which was acquired during July 2015 and whose financial statements collectively constitute 16% of consolidated total assets and 8% of consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Catamaran. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2015. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

   UnitedHealth Group 
  Director Compensation Summary 
    Our compensation and benefit program is designed to compensate our non-employee directors fairly for work required for a company of our size and scope, and align their interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Director compensation reflects our desire to attract, retain and use the expertise of highly qualified people serving on the Company s Board of Directors. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee reviews the compensation level of our non-employee directors on an annual basis and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors.  
  The Company uses annual retainers, equity-based compensation, expense reimbursement and other forms of compensation, as appropriate, to attract and retain non-employee directors.  
  Cash Compensation 
    Non-employee directors receive an annual cash retainer of $125,000. We pay an additional annual cash retainer of $300,000 to the Chair of the Board, an additional annual cash retainer of $25,000 to the Chair of the Audit Committee, an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000 to the Chair of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, and additional annual cash retainers of $15,000 to the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Chair of the Public Policy Strategies and Responsibility Committee. 
  Cash retainers are payable on a quarterly basis in arrears on the first business day following the end of each fiscal quarter, and subject to pro-rata adjustment if the director did not serve the entire quarter. Directors may elect to receive common stock or deferred stock units ( DSUs ) in lieu of their cash compensation or defer receipt of their cash compensation to a later date pursuant to the Directors' Compensation Deferral Plan ("Director Deferral Plan"). 
  Equity-Based Compensation 
  Non-employee directors receive annual grants of DSUs under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, having an annual aggregate fair value of $175,000. The grants are issued quarterly in arrears on the first business day following the end of each fiscal quarter and prorated if the director did not serve the entire quarter. The number of DSUs granted is determined by dividing $43,750 (the quarterly value of the annual equity award) by the closing stock price on the grant date, rounded up to the nearest share. 
  The DSUs immediately vest upon grant, and non-employee directors who have not met the stock ownership requirement are required to retain all DSUs granted until completion of their service on the Board of Directors. Upon completion of service, the DSUs convert into an equal number of shares of the Company s common stock. A director may defer receipt of the shares for up to ten years after completion of service pursuant to the Director Deferral Plan. Non-employee directors who have met their stock ownership requirement may elect to receive common stock in lieu of DSUs and/or in-service distributions on pre-selected dates.  
  If a director elects to convert his or her cash compensation into DSUs, such conversion grants are made on the day the eligible cash compensation becomes payable to the director and immediately vest upon grant. The director receives the number of DSUs equal to the cash  
    Effective January 1, 2016 

Exhibit 10.24 

compensation foregone, divided by the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, rounded up to the nearest share. 
  The Company pays dividend equivalents in the form of additional DSUs on all outstanding DSUs. Dividend equivalents are paid at the same rate and at the same time that dividends are paid to Company shareholders and are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying grant. 
  Director Deferral Plan 
  Under the Director Deferral Plan, subject to compliance with applicable laws, non-employee directors may elect annually to defer receipt of all or a percentage of their compensation. Amounts deferred are credited to a bookkeeping account maintained for each director participant that uses a collection of unaffiliated mutual funds as measuring investments. Subject to certain additional rules set forth in the Director Deferral Plan, a participating director may elect to receive the distribution in one of the following ways: 
             
    a series of five or ten annual installments following the completion of his or her service on the Board of Directors; 
                
    a delayed lump sum following either the fifth or tenth anniversary of the completion of his or her service on the Board of Directors; 
                
    for cash deferrals, an immediate lump sum upon the completion of his or her service on the Board of Directors; or 
                
    pre-selected amounts to be distributed on pre-selected dates while the director remains a member of the Board of Directors. 
       
  The Director Deferral Plan does not provide for matching contributions by the Company, but our Board of Directors may determine, in its discretion, to supplement the accounts of participating directors with additional amounts. 
  Other Compensation 
  We reimburse directors for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with service as a director. We also provide health care coverage to directors but only if the director is not eligible for coverage under another group health care benefit program. Health care coverage is provided generally on the same terms and conditions as current employees. Upon retirement from the Board of Directors, current directors may continue to obtain health care coverage under benefit continuation coverage, and after the lapse of such coverage, under the Company s post-employment medical plan for up to a total of 96 months if they are otherwise eligible. 
  The Company maintains a program through which it will match up to $15,000 of charitable donations made by each director for each calendar year. The directors do not receive any financial benefit from this program because the charitable income tax deductions accrue solely to the Company. Donations under the program may not be made to family trusts, partnerships or similar organizations.

  3.         Termination of Employment  . 
           A. 
    By Mutual Agreement  .  The parties may terminate Executive s employment at any time by mutual agreement.  
       
           B.

In any instance where the Company may have grounds for Cause, failure by the Company to provide written notice of the grounds for Cause within 120 days of discovery shall be a waiver of its right to assert the subject conduct as a basis for termination for Cause.  
       
           D. 
    By Executive without Good Reason  .  Executive may terminate Executive s employment at any time for any reason, including due to Executive s retirement. 
       
           E. 
    By Executive for Good Reason  .  Executive may terminate Executive s          employment for Good Reason, as defined below.  Executive must give UnitedHealth Group written notice specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances constituting Good Reason, within 120 days of becoming aware of such circumstances, or such circumstances will not constitute Good Reason.  If the circumstances constituting Good Reason are reasonably capable of being remedied, UnitedHealth Group will have 60 days to remedy such circumstances.    Good Reason  will exist if UnitedHealth Group takes any of the following actions, without Executive s consent: (a) reduces Executive s base salary or target bonus percentage other than in connection with a general reduction affecting a group of employees; (b) moves Executive s primary work location more than 50  
       3 

miles; (c) makes changes that substantially diminish Executive s duties or responsibilities; or (d) changes Executive s reporting relationship. 
       
           F. 
    Due to Executive s Death or Disability.    Executive s employment will terminate automatically if Executive dies, effective as of the date of Executive s death.  UnitedHealth Group may terminate Executive s employment due to Executive s disability that renders Executive incapable of performing the essential functions of Executive s job, with or without reasonable accommodation.  Executive will not be entitled to Severance Benefits under Section 4 in the event of termination due to Executive s death or disability. 
              4. 
    Severance Benefits  .   
              A. 
    Circumstances under Which Severance Benefits Payable  .  Executive will be entitled to Severance Benefits only if Executive s employment is terminated by UnitedHealth Group without Cause or if Executive terminates employment for Good Reason.  Whether Executive has had a termination of employment will be determined in a manner consistent with the definition of  Separation from Service  under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and its accompanying regulations ( Section 409A ) and will be referred to herein as a  Termination.   For purposes of this Agreement, Executive will be considered to have experienced a Termination as of the date that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably anticipated that Executive will provide no further services after such date or that the level of bona fide services that Executive is expected to perform permanently decreases to no more than 20% of the average level of bona fide services that Executive performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period In consideration of the Severance Benefits in this Agreement, Executive waives any payments or benefits to which Executive otherwise might be or become entitled under any UnitedHealth Group severance plan or program. 
              B. 
    Severance Benefits  .  Subject to Section 4.C, Executive shall be entitled to the following Severance Benefits if Executive experiences a Termination under the circumstances described in Section 4.A above: 
     (i) Two times Executive s annualized base salary as of Executive s Termination. 
  (ii) Two times the average of any bonus or incentive compensation paid or payable to Executive for the two most recent calendar years (excluding equity-related awards, payments under any long-term or similar benefit plan, or any other special or one-time bonus or incentive compensation payments).   
  (iii)   $  12,000 lump sum payment, minus applicable deductions, to offset costs of COBRA, which amount will be paid within 60 days following Termination.  
    4 

(iv) Outplacement services consistent with those provided to similarly situated executives provided by an outplacement firm selected by UnitedHealth Group.  
  The Severance Benefits in Sections 4.B.(i)-(ii) will be paid out, minus applicable deductions, including deductions for tax withholding, in equal bi-weekly payments on the regular payroll cycle over the 24-month period following Executive s Termination.  Commencement of payments shall begin on the first payroll date that is at least 60 days after the date of Executive s Termination (the  Starting Date ), provided that Executive has satisfied the requirement in Section 4.C.  The first payment on the Starting Date shall include those payments that would have been previously paid if the payments of the severance compensation had begun on the first payroll date following the date of Executive s Termination. Executive s entitlement to the payments of the severance compensation described in Sections 4.B(i)-(ii) shall be treated as the entitlement to a series of separate payments for purposes of Section 409A.    
  If Executive is a  Specified Employee  (within the meaning of Section 409A and determined pursuant to procedures adopted by UnitedHealth Group) at the time of Executive s Termination and any amount that would be paid to Executive during the six-month period following Termination constitutes  Deferred Compensation  (within the meaning of Section 409A), such amount shall not be paid to Executive until the later of (i) six months after the date of Executive s Termination, and (ii) the payment date or commencement date specified in this Agreement for such payment(s).  On the first regular payroll date following the expiration of such six-month period (or if Executive dies during the six-month period, the first payroll date following the death), all payments that were delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid to Executive in a single lump sum and thereafter all payments shall be made as if there had been no such delay.   All Severance Benefits described in Section 4.B shall be paid by, and no further severance compensation shall be paid or payable after, December 31 of the second calendar year following the year in which Executive s Termination occurs.    
           C. 
    Separation Agreement and Release Required  .  In order to receive any Severance Benefits under this Agreement, Executive must timely sign a separation agreement and release of claims in a form determined by UnitedHealth Group in its discretion. UnitedHealth Group shall provide to Executive a form of separation agreement and release of claims no later than three (3) days following Executive s date of Termination.  If Executive does not timely execute and deliver to UnitedHealth Group such separation agreement and release, or if Executive does so, but then revokes it if permitted by and within the time required by applicable law, UnitedHealth Group will have no obligation to pay severance compensation to Executive. 
       5
