CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
  This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on management s beliefs and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by terms and phrases such as  anticipate,   believe,   intend,   estimate,   expect,   continue,   should,   could,   may,   plan,   project,   predict,   will,   potential,   forecast,   target,   guidance,   outlook,  and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results predicted. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: 
             
    State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements or climate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or market prices; 
                
    The extent and timing of the costs and liabilities relating to the Dan River ash basin release and compliance with current and any future regulatory changes related to the management of coal ash; 
                
    The ability to recover eligible costs, including those associated with future significant weather events, and earn an adequate return on investment through the regulatory process; 
                
    The costs of decommissioning nuclear facilities could prove to be more extensive than are currently identified and all costs may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process; 
                
    The risk that the credit ratings of the company or its subsidiaries may be different from what the companies expect; 
                
    Costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; 
                
    Industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in service territories or customer bases resulting from customer usage patterns, including energy efficiency efforts and use of alternative energy sources, including self-generation and distributed generation technologies; 
                
    Additional competition in electric markets and continued industry consolidation; 
                
    Political and regulatory uncertainty in other countries in which Duke Energy conducts business; 
                
    The influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic, operational and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts and tornadoes; 
                
    The ability to successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to customers; 
                
    The impact on facilities and business from a terrorist attack, cybersecurity threats, data security breaches, and other catastrophic events; 
                
    The inherent risks associated with the operation and potential construction of nuclear facilities, including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks; 
                
    The timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and the ability to recover such costs through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets; 
                
    The results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings and general economic conditions; 
                
    Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans, and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; 
                
    Construction and development risks associated with the completion of Duke Energy Registrants  capital investment projects in existing and new generation facilities, including risks related to financing, obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules, and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to recover costs from customers in a timely manner or at all; 
                
    Changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, including changes in rate designs and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks related to obligations created by the default of other participants; 
                
    The ability to control operation and maintenance costs; 
                
    The level of creditworthiness of counterparties to transactions; 
                
    Employee workforce factors, including the potential inability to attract and retain key personnel; 
                
    The ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to Duke Energy Corporation holding company (the Parent); 
                
    The performance of projects undertaken by our nonregulated businesses and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities; 
                
    The effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies; 
                
    The impact of potential goodwill impairments; 
                
    The ability to reinvest prospective undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries or repatriate such earnings on a tax-efficient basis; and

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than described.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

DUKE ENERGY                 

General 
  Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Duke Energy operates in the United States (U.S.) and Latin America primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Duke Energy's subsidiaries include its subsidiary registrants (collectively referred to as the Subsidiary Registrants); Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas); Progress Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy); Duke Energy Progress, Inc. (Duke Energy Progress); Duke Energy Florida, Inc. (Duke Energy Florida); Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio); and Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (Duke Energy Indiana). When discussing Duke Energy s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  On August 21, 2014, Duke Energy entered into an agreement to sell its nonregulated Midwest generation business (Disposal Group) to Dynegy Inc. (Dynegy) for approximately $2.8 billion in cash subject to adjustments at closing for changes in working capital and capital expenditures. The Disposal Group primarily includes Duke Energy Ohio's coal-fired and gas-fired generation assets located in the Midwest region of the United States and dispatched into the PJM wholesale market. These assets earn energy and capacity revenue at market price. The Disposal Group also includes a retail sales subsidiary of Duke Energy, Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC (Duke Energy Retail), which is certified as a Competitive Retail Electric Supplier (CRES) provider in Ohio. Duke Energy Retail serves retail electric and gas customers in Ohio with energy and provides other energy services at competitive rates. Completion of the transaction is conditioned on approval by FERC. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2015. For additional information on the Midwest generation business disposition see Note   2   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions, Dispositions and Sales of Other Assets." 
  The Duke Energy Registrants electronically file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxies and amendments to such reports. 
  The public may read and copy any materials the Duke Energy Registrants file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Additionally, information about the Duke Energy Registrants, including reports filed with the SEC, is available through Duke Energy s website at http://www.duke-energy.com. Such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC. 
    Business Segments 
  Duke Energy conducts its operations in three business segments; Regulated Utilities, International Energy and Commercial Power. The remainder of Duke Energy s operations are presented as Other. Duke Energy s chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note   3   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Business Segments.  
  The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy s reportable business segments, as well as Other. 
  REGULATED UTILITIES 
  Regulated Utilities conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana, and Duke Energy Ohio. These electric and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), and the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC). 
  Regulated Utilities serves 7.3 million retail electric customers in six states in the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. Its service area covers approximately 95,000 square miles with an estimated population of 23 million people. Regulated Utilities serves 500,000 retail natural gas customers in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. Electricity is also sold wholesale to incorporated municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities. 
  The following table represents the distribution of billed sales by customer class for the year ended   December 31, 2014  .   

           (a) 
    Primary general service sectors include health care, education, financial services, information technology and military buildings. Primary industrial sectors include textiles, chemicals, rubber and plastics, paper, food and beverage, and auto manufacturing. 
       9 

PART I 

            (b) 
    Primary general service sectors include tourism, health care and government facilities and schools. Primary industrial sectors include phosphate rock mining and processing and citrus and other food processing. 
              (c) 
    Primary general service sectors include health care, education, real estate and rental leasing, financial and insurance services, water/wastewater services, and wholesale trade services. Primary industrial sectors include aerospace, primary metals, chemicals and food. 
              (d) 
    Primary general service sectors include retail, financial, healthcare and education services. Primary industrial sectors include primary and fabricated metals, transportation equipment, building materials, food and beverage, stone/clay/glass, and chemicals. 
     The number of residential, general service and industrial customers within the Regulated Utilities service territory is expected to increase over time. However, growth in the near term has been hampered by current economic conditions. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or decline for the foreseeable future. While total industrial and general service sales increased in   2014   when compared to   2013  , the growth rate was modest when compared to historical periods. 
  Seasonality and the Impact of Weather 
  Regulated Utilities  costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, resulting in higher revenue and cash flows in these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Peak gas sales occur during the winter months. Residential and general service customers are most impacted by weather. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions. 
  The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances from a normal condition and customers  historic usage levels and patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not and cannot consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity and relative temperature changes. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods. 
  Degree-day data are used to estimate energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures based on each day s average temperature. Heating-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating-degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling-degree day. 
  Competition 
  Retail 
  Regulated Utilities  businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. Regulated Utilities owns and operates facilities necessary to transmit and distribute electricity and, except in Ohio, to generate electricity. Services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices. Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from on-site generation of industrial customers and distributed generation, such as rooftop solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites. 
  Regulated Utilities is not aware of any proposed legislation in any jurisdiction that would give its retail customers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry. 
  Although there is no pending legislation at this time, if the retail jurisdictions served by Regulated Utilities become subject to deregulation, the recovery of stranded costs could become a significant consideration. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of Regulated Utilities whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power commitments from qualifying facilities (QFs). The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) established a new class of generating facilities as QFs, typically small power production facilities that generate power within a utility company s service territory for which the utility companies are legally obligated to purchase the energy at an avoided cost rate. Thus far, all states that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to recover a substantial portion of stranded costs. 
  Regulated Utilities  largest stranded cost exposure is primarily related to Duke Energy Florida s purchased power commitments with QFs, under which it has future minimum expected capacity payments through 2025 of $2.2 billion. Duke Energy Florida was obligated to enter into these contracts under provisions of PURPA. Duke Energy Florida continues to seek ways to address the impact of escalating payments under these contracts. However, the FPSC allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from QFs. For additional information related to these purchased power commitments, see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.   
  In Ohio, Regulated Utilities conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. Regulated Utilities earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity only and not on the cost of the underlying energy. 
  Wholesale 
  Regulated Utilities competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives, and wholesale transactions. The principal factors in competing for these sales are price, availability of capacity and power, and reliability of service. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs. 
  Increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect Regulated Utilities  load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of Regulated Utilities to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. 
    10 

PART I 

   Energy Capacity and Resources 
  Regulated Utilities owns approximately 50,000 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity. For additional information on Regulated Utilities  generation facilities, see Item 2,  Properties.  
  Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause Regulated Utilities to purchase power for its customers include generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, growth, and price. Regulated Utilities has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy, and reliability of power supply. 
  Regulated Utilities  generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements. 
  Recently Completed Generation Projects 
  The additional capacity from recently completed generation projects allowed Regulated Utilities to retire or plan to retire older, less efficient capacity. The following table summarizes the generation projects constructed and placed in service during the past three years.   

  Potential Plant Retirements 
  The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. Recent IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their current estimated useful lives. These facilities do not have the requisite emission control equipment, primarily to meet United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations recently approved or proposed. These facilities total approximately 1,704 MW at three sites. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives, and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these assets are retired. For additional information related to potential plant retirements see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters.  
  Sources of Electricity 
  Regulated Utilities relies principally on coal, natural gas and nuclear fuel for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended   December 31, 2014  .   

           (a) 
    Statistics include Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida beginning July 2, 2012.  
              (b) 
    Statistics related to all fuels reflect Regulated Utilities' ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities.  
              (c) 
    Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped storage facilities during off-peak periods.  
              (d) 
    Purchased power includes renewable energy purchases.  
              (e) 
    Includes the effect of the Joint Dispatch Agreement (JDA) and Mitigation sales. Mitigation sales are excluded from the Regulated Utilities segment.  
       11 

PART I 

   Coal 
  Regulated Utilities meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Regulated Utilities uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range from 2015 to 2016 for Duke Energy Carolinas, 2015 to 2018 for Duke Energy Progress, 2015 to 2016 for Duke Energy Florida, and 2015 to 2025 for Duke Energy Indiana. Regulated Utilities expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. Coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. Regulated Utilities has an adequate supply of coal under contract to fuel its projected 2015 operations and a significant portion of supply to fuel its projected 2016 operations. Current coal inventory levels for Regulated Utilities are at adequate levels and are expected to remain at adequate levels for the remainder of 2015. Changing natural gas prices continue to influence the level of coal generation.  
  The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by Regulated Utilities is between 1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Carolinas, between 1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Progress, between 1 percent and 2.5 percent for Duke Energy Florida, and between 2 percent and 3 percent for Duke Energy Indiana. Regulated Utilities  environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO   2   ) emission allowances, enable Regulated Utilities to satisfy current SO   2    emission limitations for its existing facilities. 
  Nuclear 
  The industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, and services to convert, enrich, and fabricate fuel assemblies. 
  Regulated Utilities has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. Regulated Utilities staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, Regulated Utilities generally sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear contracts. 
  Regulated Utilities has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100 percent of its uranium concentrates, conversion services, and enrichment services requirements through at least 2015 and cover fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2018. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Regulated Utilities believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire, or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services. 
  Gas and Oil 
  Natural gas and oil supply for Regulated Utilities  generation fleet is purchased under term and spot contracts from various suppliers. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to limit a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. Regulated Utilities has certain dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate with both natural gas and oil. The cost of Regulated Utilities  natural gas and oil is either at a fixed price or determined by market prices as reported in certain industry publications. Regulated Utilities believes it has access to an adequate supply of gas and oil for the reasonably foreseeable future. Regulated Utilities  natural gas transportation for its gas generation is purchased under long-term firm transportation contracts with interstate and intrastate pipelines. Regulated Utilities may also purchase additional shorter-term transportation for its load requirements during peak periods. The Regulated Utilities natural gas plants are served by several supply zones and multiple pipelines. 
  Purchased Power 
  Regulated Utilities purchased approximately 14.3 million megawatt-hours (MWh), 11.7 million MWh and 19.8 million MWh of its system energy requirements during   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively, under purchase obligations and leases and had 4,500 and 3,800 MW of firm purchased capacity under contract during   2014   and   2013  , respectively. These amounts include MWh for Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida for all periods presented. These agreements include amounts contracted with certain QFs. Regulated Utilities may need to acquire additional purchased power capacity in the future to accommodate a portion of its system load needs. Regulated Utilities believes it can obtain adequate purchased power to meet these needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected. 
  Gas for Retail Distribution 
  Regulated Utilities is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to retail customers in its Ohio and Kentucky service territories. Regulated Utilities  natural gas procurement strategy is to buy firm natural gas supplies and firm interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter season and during the non-heating season through a combination of firm supply and transportation capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity. This strategy allows Regulated Utilities to assure reliable natural gas supply for its non-curtailable customers during peak winter conditions and provides Regulated Utilities the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm customers choose alternate gas. In   2014  , firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided approximately 97 percent of the natural gas supply. 
  Inventory 
  Generation of electricity is capital intensive. Regulated Utilities must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of   December 31, 2014  , the inventory balance for Regulated Utilities was $3,348 million. For additional information on inventory see Note   1   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

PART I 

   North Carolina Ash Basin Management 
  On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas  retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river during the incident. Duke Energy Carolinas incurred approximately $24 million of repairs and remediation expense related to this incident during the year ended   December 31, 2014  . Duke Energy Carolinas will not seek recovery of these costs from customers. In July 2014, Duke Energy completed remediation work identified by the EPA and continues to cooperate with the EPA's civil enforcement process.  
  As a result of separate Memoranda of Plea Agreement (Plea Agreements) entered into by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in connection with a criminal investigation related to the Dan River ash basin release and the management of coal ash basins at the 14 plants in North Carolina with coal ash basins, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recognized expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $72 million and $30 million, respectively. The Plea Agreements are subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina and, if approved, will end the grand jury investigation related to the Dan River ash basin release and the management of coal ash basins at the 14 plants in North Carolina with coal ash basins.  
  The Plea Agreements do not cover pending civil claims related to the Dan River coal ash release and operations at other North Carolina facilities with ash basins. Duke Energy Corporation will continue to defend against remaining civil actions associated with these matters. Other costs related to the Dan River release including state or federal civil enforcement proceedings, future regulatory directives, natural resources damages, pending litigation, future claims or litigation, and long-term environmental impact costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
  For additional information on the North Carolina Ash Basin Grand Jury Investigation and Plea Agreements, see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies."  
  Nuclear Matters 
  Regulated Utilities owns, wholly or partially, 12 nuclear reactors located at seven stations. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property, decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and replacement power expense coverage. Joint owners reimburse Regulated Utilities for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which currently is $13.6 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.  
  Regulated Utilities has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Regulated Utilities to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years. 
  The following table summarizes the fair value of nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) balances and cost study results for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida.   

           (a) 
    Represents cost per the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies, including costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination. Amounts are in dollars of the year of cost study. 
              (b) 
    Includes the Subsidiary Registrants' ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors. 
     The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC have allowed Regulated Utilities  to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. Regulated Utilities believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balance and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. For additional information see Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations.  
  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) (NWPA) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The NWPA promotes increased usage of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at existing nuclear plants. Regulated Utilities will continue to maximize the use of spent fuel storage capability within its own facilities for as long as feasible. 
  Under federal law, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Delays have occurred in the DOE s proposed permanent repository to be located at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. 
    13 

PART I 

   Until the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. With certain modifications and additional approvals by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), including the expansion of on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for all sites except Shearon Harris Nuclear Station (Harris) and Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Station (Crystal River Unit 3). Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. Crystal River Unit 3 was retired in 2013, with plans to place the facility in SAFSTOR prior to final decommissioning. An independent spent fuel storage installation will be installed to accommodate storage of all spent nuclear fuel until the DOE accepts the spent nuclear fuel.  
  The nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction, the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning plants at the end of their licensed lives, and requirements relating to nuclear insurance. Nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, repairs, uprates and certain other modifications. 
  Regulated Utilities is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. Nuclear operating licenses are potentially subject to extension. The following table includes the current expiration of nuclear operating licenses.   

           (a) 
    Duke Energy Florida has requested the NRC to terminate the Crystal River Unit 3 operating license as Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. For additional information on decommissioning activity and transition to SAFSTOR, see Note   4   "Regulatory Matters." 
     The NRC issues orders with regard to security at nuclear plants in response to new or emerging threats. The most recent orders include additional restrictions on nuclear plant access, increased security measures at nuclear facilities and closer coordination with intelligence, military, law enforcement and emergency response functions at the federal, state and local levels. As the NRC, other governmental entities and the industry continue to consider security issues, it is possible that more extensive security plans could be required. 
  Regulation 
  State 
  The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, PUCO, IURC and KPSC (collectively, the state utility commissions) approve rates for retail electric and gas service within their respective states. The state utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of Regulated Utilities  generating facilities. Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity issued by the state utility commissions, as applicable, authorize Regulated Utilities to construct and operate its electric facilities, and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state utility commission is required for Regulated Utilities to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity. 
  Each of the state utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost-recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent. The clauses are in addition to approved base rates. 
  Fuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by Regulated Utilities. Regulated Utilities uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Regulated Utilities, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Regulated Utilities. 
    14 

PART I 

   The following table summarizes base rate cases approved and effective in the past three years.   

           (a) 
    Rates increase over a two or three year period as approved by the NCUC and PSCSC. Annual increase amounts represent the total increase once effective. 
              (b) 
    Terms of this rate case include (i) recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than when the outage occurs, (ii) a $10 million shareholder contribution to agencies providing energy assistance to low-income customers, (iii) an annual reduction in the regulatory liability for costs of removal of $30 million for each of the first two years, and (iv) no additional base rate increases to be effective before September 2015. 
              (c) 
    Terms of this rate case include (i) recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than when the outage occurs, (ii) an approximate $4 million shareholder contribution to agencies providing energy assistance to low-income customers and for economic development, (iii) a reduction in the regulatory liability for costs of removal of $45 million for the first year, and (iv) no additional base rate increases to be effective before September 2015. 
              (d) 
    Terms of this rate case include (i) recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than when the outage occurs, (ii) a $20 million shareholder contribution to agencies providing energy assistance to low-income customers, and (iii) a reduction in the regulatory liability for costs of removal of $20 million for the first year. 
              (e) 
    Although the PUCO approved no increase in base rates, more than half of the revenue request was approved to be recovered in various riders, including recovery of costs related to former manufactured gas plants (MGP). Recovery of $56 million of MGP costs via a rider was approved in November 2013. The rider became effective in March 2014, was suspended in June 2014 and reinstated in January 2015. For additional information on MGP recovery see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters.  
              (f) 
    Terms of this settlement include (i) no additional base rate increases until 2019, (ii) partial recovery of Crystal River Unit 3 beginning in 2014, and (iii) full recovery of Crystal River Unit 3, not to exceed $1,466 million, plus the cost to build a dry cask storage facility, beginning no later than 2017. 
              (g) 
    Terms of this settlement include the removal of Crystal River Unit 3 assets from rate base.  
              (h) 
    Capital structure includes deferred income tax, customer deposits and investment tax credits.

In addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis - Matters Impacting Future Results for each registrant in Item 7, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy. 
    19 

PART I 

   Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  regulated electric revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  regulated utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants  future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants  future earnings could be negatively impacted. 
  If legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy Registrants  exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded, their future earnings could be negatively impacted. 
  Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations or cash flows and their utility businesses. 
  Increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Retail competition and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have a significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation that will affect their operations and costs. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulation by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other federal agencies as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the future course of regulatory changes or the ultimate effect those changes will have on their businesses. However, changes in regulation can cause delays in or affect business planning and transactions and can substantially increase the Duke Energy Registrants  costs. 
  The Dan River ash basin release could impact the reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  There is uncertainty regarding the extent and timing of future additional costs and liabilities related to the Dan River ash basin release, including the amount and extent of any pending or future civil or criminal penalties, and resulting litigation. These uncertainties are likely to continue for an extended period and may further increase costs. Thus, the Dan River ash basin release could have an adverse impact on the reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants and their financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including coal combustion residuals (CCRs), air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to regulatory cost recovery, the Duke Energy Registrants are at risk that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will have such an effect. 
  The EPA has recently enacted or proposed new federal regulations governing the management of cooling water intake structures, wastewater and carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) emissions. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs. 
    20 

PART I 

   Duke Energy s investments and projects located outside of the U.S. expose it to risks related to the laws, taxes, economic and political conditions, and policies of foreign governments. These risks may delay or reduce Duke Energy s realization of value from its international projects. 
  Duke Energy currently owns and may acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the U.S. The economic, regulatory, market and political conditions in some of the countries where Duke Energy has interests may impact its ability to obtain financing on suitable terms. Other risks relate to its customers  ability to honor their obligations with respect to projects and investments, delays in construction, limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights, and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law, regulations, market rules or tax policy. 
  Operational Risks 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control. 
  Sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence electricity operations. Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated electric business is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel, under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could reduce the Duke Energy Registrants  revenues and margins, thereby diminishing results of operations. 
  Factors that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity are as follows: 
             
    weather conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy usage for heating or cooling purposes, respectively, and periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner; 
                
    supply of and demand for energy commodities; 
                
    transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies that impact nonregulated energy operations; 
                
    availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or gas plants, and customer usage of energy efficient equipment that reduces energy demand; 
                
    natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices; 
                
    ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, such as coal, gas and uranium; and 
                
    capacity and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants  markets. 
     Natural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  operating results. 
  Natural disasters (such as electromagnetic events or the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan) or other operational accidents within the company or industry (such as the San Bruno, California natural gas transmission pipeline failure) could have direct significant impacts on the Duke Energy Registrants as well as on key contractors and suppliers. Such events could indirectly impact the Duke Energy Registrants through changes to policies, laws and regulations whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Coal ash storage and management strategies to comply with CCR regulations could impact the reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  As a result of electricity produced at coal-fired power plants Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCRs in dry storage in landfills or combined with water in ash basins. The potential exists for another coal ash pond failure or coal ash related incident, such as the one that occurred during the Dan River ash basin release, that could impact the environment or raise general public health concerns. Such an incident could have a material adverse impact to the reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants.   
  Recent regulations for the disposal of CCRs from power plants by the EPA are expected to be effective in 2015. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments, structural fills and CCR piles and establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. In addition to federal CCR regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be independently regulated by most states and additional regulations by states may be imposed in the future. At this time, Duke Energy is evaluating the federal and state CCR regulations and developing cost estimates that will largely be dependent upon compliance alternatives selected to meet requirements of the regulations. These federal and state regulations may require additional capital expenditures, increased operating and maintenance costs, or closure of certain facilities which could affect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. Although the Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek cost recovery for future expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state utility  
    21 

PART I 

   commissions, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations, there is no guarantee that recovery of such costs will be granted.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers. 
  Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. 
  Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. 
  Advances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Furthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather. 
  Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business. In most parts of the U.S., and other markets in which Duke Energy operates, demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months, with market prices typically peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Further, extreme weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, in the future, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period comparison less relevant. 
  Sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages; property damage, including downed transmission and distribution lines; and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market. FERC s power transmission regulations, as well as those of Duke Energy s international markets, require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered. 
  The different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants  wholesale power marketing business. 
  Fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants  operations as well as their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost-recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions. 
  Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations,     force majeure   events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the Duke Energy Registrants to operate their facilities. Should counterparties fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. 
  Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants  hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, derivative collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily derivative position. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants  credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity. 
    22 

PART I 

   Potential terrorist activities or military or other actions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses. 
  The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. or their international affiliates. Information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups. The potential for terrorism has subjected the Duke Energy Registrants  operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC s design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. 
  Cyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses.  
  Information security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. The utility industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the Internet continues to increase through smart grid and other initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the Internet and technology systems  inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy Registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattack. In the event of such an attack, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, property damaged, customer information stolen and other private information accessed (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss, and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. 
  Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations. 
  Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial position or results of operations could be negatively affected. 
  Duke Energy s investments and projects located outside of the U.S. expose it to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. These risks, and Duke Energy s activities to mitigate such risks, may adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations. 
  Duke Energy s operations and investments outside the U.S. expose it to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. As each local currency s value changes relative to the U.S. dollar, the value in U.S. dollars of Duke Energy s assets and liabilities in such locality and the cash flows generated in such locality, expressed in U.S. dollars, also change. Duke Energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the Brazilian Real. 
  Duke Energy selectively mitigates some risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations by, among other things, indexing contracts to the U.S. dollar and/or local inflation rates, hedging through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency and hedging through foreign currency derivatives. These efforts, however, may not be effective and, in some cases, may expose Duke Energy to other risks that could negatively affect its cash flows and results of operations. 
  The costs of retiring Duke Energy Florida s Crystal River Unit 3 could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified. 
  Costs to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimates and, if not recoverable through the regulatory process, could adversely affect Duke Energy s, Progress Energy s and Duke Energy Florida s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s membership in an RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  The rules governing the various regional power markets may change, which could affect Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s costs and/or revenues. To the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. While RTO transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral, various proposals and proceedings currently taking place by the FERC may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. In addition, RTOs have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. 
  As members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members. 
  Nuclear Generation Risks 
  Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities. 
    23 

PART I 

   Ownership interest in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. 
  Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, and/or shut down a unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition and reputation of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. 
  Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks 
  The Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term capital markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants  control. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  businesses are financed to a large degree through debt. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access capital at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access capital may limit the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth. 
  Market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, capital market conditions generally, market prices for electricity and gas, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energy s Master Credit Facility depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement. 
  Duke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the Master Credit Facility. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity. 
  Each of the Duke Energy Registrants  senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the future. 
  If the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited. A reduction in liquidity and borrowing availability could ultimately impact the ability to indefinitely reinvest prospective undistributed earnings generated by Duke Energy s foreign subsidiaries, which could result in significant income taxes that would have a material effect on its results of operations. 
  A downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants  liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Non-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to execute future borrowings. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. 
    24 

PART I 

   Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding. 
  Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected. 
  Poor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants  liquidity and results of operations. 
  The costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants  proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality Civil Enforcement 
  Duke Energy Carolinas and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality are in negotiations regarding civil enforcement against Duke Energy Carolinas related to the February 2, 2014, coal ash release from Duke Energy Carolinas  Dan River Steam Station. Monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000 appear likely.  
  Brazilian Transmission Fee Assessments 
  On July 16, 2008, Duke Energy International Geracao Paranapanema S.A. (DEIGP) filed a lawsuit in the Brazilian federal court challenging transmission fee assessments imposed under two new resolutions promulgated by the Brazilian electricity regulatory agency (ANEEL) (collectively, the Resolutions). The Resolutions purport to impose additional transmission fees on generation companies located in the State of Sao Paulo for utilization of the electric transmission system. The fees were retroactive to July 1, 2004, and effective through June 30, 2009. DEIGP's original assessment under these Resolutions amounts to approximately $56 million inclusive of interest through December 2014. Pending resolution of this dispute on the merits, DEIGP deposited the disputed portion, approximately $19 million, of the assessment into a court-monitored escrow, and paid the undisputed portion to the distribution companies. In a decision published on October 2, 2013, the trial court affirmed an additional fine imposed by ANEEL in the amount of $9 million for DEIGP s failure to pay the disputed portion of the assessment. The $9 million was also deposited into a court-monitored escrow. In December 2014, the trial court ruled in favor of DEIGP on the merits of the original assessment. The merits of the original assessment and fine, as well as the contradiction between the trial court's ruling in favor of DEIGP on the original assessment but against DEIGP on its alleged failure to timely pay that assessment, will be addressed on appeal.  
  Brazilian Regulatory Citations 
  In September 2007, the State Environmental Agency of Parana (IAP) assessed seven fines against DEIGP, totaling $15 million for failure to comply with reforestation measures allegedly required by state regulations in Brazil. DEIGP has challenged the fines in administrative and judicial proceedings. Two of the seven fines have subsequently been dismissed or otherwise resolved in favor of DEIGP. A third fine was determined legitimate by the trial court, but is under appeal. The remaining fines are pending.  
  Additionally, DEIGP was assessed three fines by Brazil Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) for improper maintenance of existing reforested areas. One of these fines was determined legitimate by the trial court and is under appeal. The others are pending. The total current IBAMA assessment is approximately $500,000. DEIGP believes that it has properly maintained all reforested areas and has challenged the IBAMA assessments.  
  Gibson Notice of Violations 
  Pursuant to Notices of Violation dated June 23, 2011 and July 16, 2013, the EPA has asserted that, on several occasions between August 1, 2008 through March 31, 2013, Duke Energy Indiana s Gibson steam station violated opacity limits contained in its Title V permit. Duke Energy Indiana entered into a settlement agreement with the EPA in the fourth quarter of 2014, which required payment of a civil penalty of $199,000.

           (a) 
    See Results of Operations below for Duke Energy s definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income attributable to Duke Energy and net income attributable to Duke Energy per diluted share. 
       34 

PART II 

   Adjusted earnings increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to the impact of the revised rates and favorable weather, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted earnings increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of Progress Energy results in 2013, the impact of the revised rates, net of higher depreciation and amortization expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). 
  See  Results of Operations  below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations, as well as a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy s reportable business segments, as well as Other. 
  2014   Areas of Focus and Accomplishments 
  In 2014, Duke Energy focused on achieving financial objectives, completing important strategic initiatives, including the agreement to sell the non-regulated Midwest Generation business and completion of a strategic review of the international business, advancing a platform of growth initiatives, operational excellence, and the strengthening of coal ash management practices and plans to accelerate basin closure strategies resulting from the Dan River coal ash spill. 
  Sale of the Midwest Generation Business.   In 2014, Duke Energy entered into a PSA to sell the Disposal Group to Dynegy for approximately $2.8 billion. This decision supports Duke Energy s strategy to focus investments on businesses with more predictable and less volatile earnings. 
  International Energy Operations.   Duke Energy completed the strategic review of the international operations. As a result of the review, Duke Energy determined it is in the shareholders  best interest, at the present time, to continue to own, operate and create value through portfolio optimization and efficiency in the International operations. In addition, Duke Energy declared a taxable dividend of historical foreign earnings in the form of notes payable that will result in the repatriation of approximately $2.7 billion of cash held and expected to be generated by International Energy over a period of up to eight years. The cash will help support the dividend and growth in the investment portfolio of the domestic businesses. 
  Growth Initiatives.   In 2014, Duke Energy announced new growth initiatives representing a total investment of approximately $8 billion. These initiatives include: 
             
    Duke Energy Indiana proposed transmission and distribution infrastructure improvement totaling $1.9 billion.  
                
    Duke Energy Florida proposed approximately $1.8 billion investment in three new generation projects, a combined-cycle plant in Citrus County, an uprate plan at the Hines Energy Complex (Hines) facility and acquisition of the Osprey plant from Calpine Corporation (Calpine).  
                
    Duke Energy Progress proposed the acquisition of North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency's (NCEMPA) ownership interest in some of Duke Energy Progress s existing nuclear and coal generation and the acquisition of solar projects in eastern North Carolinas for a total amount of approximately $1.2 billion.  
                
    Duke Energy Carolinas proposed construction of a combined-cycle natural gas plant at the William States Lee generation facility at a cost of approximately $600 million.  
                
    Commercial Power proposed construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline for a total investment of approximately $2 billion 
     Operational Excellence of the Nuclear Fleet.   Duke Energy s nuclear fleet set a company record for total electricity production and demonstrated a combined capacity factor at approximately 93 percent, the 16th consecutive year above 90 percent on this plant reliability measure. 
  Deliver Merger Benefits.   Duke Energy continues to focus on realizing benefits of the merger with Progress Energy. Duke Energy is on-track to achieve the $687 million of guaranteed savings for customers in the Carolinas over five years. After two and a half years, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have generated over 60 percent of the guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch savings. In total 85 percent of the guaranteed benefit has been locked-in or delivered to Duke Energy s customers in the Carolinas. 
  Dan River Coal Ash Spill and Other Coal Ash Management  . Duke Energy has improved coal ash practices and accelerated plans to close its ash basins. Comprehensive engineering reviews were completed at each of the ash basins, and a central internal organization was formed to manage all coal combustion products. Duke Energy also established an independent national Coal Ash Management Advisory Board to help guide company strategy. Excavation plans have been filed for four high priority sites identified in connection with North Carolina coal ash management enacted in 2014 - Dan River, Asheville, Riverbend, and L.V. Sutton combined cycle facility (Sutton). Excavation plans have also been filed for the W.S. Lee site in South Carolina, and work is progressing on closure plans for the other ten North Carolina sites. 
  On   February 20, 2015  , Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Business Services LLC (DEBS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, each entered into a Memorandum of Plea Agreement (Plea Agreements) in connection with an investigation initiated by the USDOJ. The Plea Agreements are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina and, if approved, will end the grand jury investigation related to the Dan River ash basin release and the management of coal ash basins at   14   plants in North Carolina with coal ash basins. 
  Under the Plea Agreements, the USDOJ charged DEBS and Duke Energy Progress with four misdemeanor CWA violations related to violations at Duke Energy Progress  H.F. Lee Steam Electric Plant, Cape Fear Steam Electric Plant and Asheville Steam Electric Generating Plant. The United States Department Of Justice charged Duke Energy Carolinas and DEBS with five misdemeanor Clean Water Act violations related to violations at Duke Energy Carolinas  Dan River Steam Station and Riverbend Steam Station. DEBS, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress also agreed (i) to a five-year probation period, (ii) to pay a total of approximately   $68 million   in fines and restitution and   $34 million   for community service and mitigation (the Payments), and (iii) to establish environmental compliance plans subject to the oversight of a court-appointed monitor paid for by the companies for the duration of the probation period (iii) for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress each to maintain   $250 million   under their Master Credit Facility as security to meet their obligations under the Pleas Agreements, in addition to certain other conditions set out in the Plea Agreements. Payments under the Plea Agreements will be borne by shareholders and are not tax deductible. Duke Energy Corporation has agreed to issue a guarantee of all payments and performance due from the Companies, including but not limited to payments for fines, restitution, community service, mitigation and the funding of, and obligations under, the environmental compliance plans. As a result of the Plea Agreements, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recognized charges of   $72 million   and   $30 million  , respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The amounts are recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

PART II 

   Duke Energy Objectives - 2015 and Beyond 
  Duke Energy is committed to creating value and trust, while transforming our energy future. Primary objectives for 2015 are: 
             
    Growing and adapting the business and achieving financial objectives, including delivering on the 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75, and advancing viable future growth opportunities for regulated and nonregulated businesses 
                
    Excelling in safety, operational performance and environmental stewardship 
                
    Developing and engaging employees, while strengthening leadership 
                
    Improving the lives of our customers and the vitality of our communities 
     Complete the Sale of the Nonregulated Midwest Generation Business.     In January 2015, FERC requested additional information regarding the proposed sale of the nonregulated Midwest Generation business. The parties to the transaction responded to FERC on February 6, 2015, and the comment period expired on February 23, 2015. FERC approval is the final regulatory approval required to close the transaction, which is expected by the end of the second quarter of 2015. 
  Proceeds from the sale are expected to be deployed to recapitalize Duke Energy in a balanced manner, with a combination of an accelerated share repurchase and reductions in holding company debt. However, this plan could change depending on circumstances at the time of closing. 
  Growth Initiatives.   Duke Energy will continue to pursue regulatory, state and federal approval of the growth projects. These projects will support long-term adjusted earnings growth of four to six percent and support Duke Energy s ability to continue providing its customers affordable, reliable energy from an increasingly diverse generation portfolio. 
  In the Regulated Utilities business, Duke Energy does not anticipate any significant base rate cases through 2017. Growth is expected to be supported by retail and wholesale load growth and significant investments. Duke Energy expects to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion annually in Regulated business growth projects. Many of these projects will be recovered through riders such as transmission and distribution expenditures in Indiana and Ohio, as well as the Crystal River 3 rider in Florida and energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas. The regulated wholesale business is expected to grow in 2015.   
  The Commercial Power renewables business is a significant component of the Duke Energy growth strategy. Renewable projects enable Duke Energy to respond to customer interest in clean tech while increasing diversity in the generation portfolio. The portfolio of wind and solar is expected to continue growing as between $1 billion and $2 billion is deployed over the next three years .Additionally, investments in the Atlantic Coast pipeline adds approximately $1 billion of capital spending through 2017.  
  Continue the Coal Ash Management Strategy  . In December 2014, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) related to coal combustion residuals (CCR) associated with the generation of electricity from coal. The rules classify coal ash as non-hazardous waste and provide guidelines related to the disposal of coal ash. Duke Energy will continue the compliance strategy with the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) and complete an evaluation of the provisions for this rule. Duke Energy will update ash management plans to comply with all state and federal regulations and begin excavation or other compliance work once plans and permits are approved. 
  Results of Operations 
  In this section, Duke Energy provides analysis and discussion of earnings and factors affecting earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
  Management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. These items are measured as income from continuing operations net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and special items including the operating results of the Disposal Group classified as discontinued operations for GAAP purposes. Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. As result of the agreement in August 2014 to sell the Disposal Group to Dynegy, the operating results of the Disposal Group are classified as discontinued operations, including a portion of the mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative contracts. Management believes that including the operating results of the Disposal Group classified as discontinued operations better reflects its financial performance and therefore has included these results in adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. Derivative contracts are used in Duke Energy s hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Power segment. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately and, if associated with the Disposal Group, classified as discontinued operations, as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output commodities (e.g., coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy s performance across periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the Duke Energy Board of Directors (Board of Directors), employees, shareholders, analysts and investors concerning Duke Energy s financial performance. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation and Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common shareholders, which include the dollar and per share impact of special items, mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and discontinued operations. 
    36 

PART II 

   Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and special items. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income as presented provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income is segment income, which represents segment income from continuing operations, including any special items and the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment. 
  Duke Energy s adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted segment income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other entities may not calculate the measures in the same manner. 
  See Note   3   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Business Segments,  for a discussion of Duke Energy s segment structure. 
  Overview 
  The following table reconciles non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.   

37 

PART II 

   The variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended   December 31, 2014  , compared to   2013  , was primarily due to: 
             
    Increased retail pricing and riders primarily resulting from the implementation of revised rates in most jurisdictions; 
                 
    Higher PJM capacity revenues for the nonregulated Midwest generation business due to higher prices; and 
                
    Higher results of the renewables business due to higher production from the wind and solar portfolios, lower costs and additional renewables investments. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    Higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to higher depreciable asset base and lower reductions to cost of removal reserves;  
                
    Higher operations and maintenance expense due to higher storm costs, the timing of fossil plant outages and the impact of nuclear outage cost levelization; 
                
    Lower post in-service debt returns due to projects added to customer rates; and 
                
    Higher property and other non-income taxes. 
     The variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended   December 31, 2013  , compared to   2012  , was primarily due to: 
             
    The inclusion of Progress Energy results for the first six months of 2013; 
                
    Increased retail pricing and riders resulting primarily from the implementation of revised rates in all jurisdictions; and 
                
    Lower operating and maintenance expense resulting primarily from the adoption of nuclear outage cost levelization in the Carolinas, lower benefit costs and merger synergies.  
     Partially offsetting these increases was: 
             
    Higher depreciation and amortization expense; 
                
    Lower AFUDC; 
                
    Lower nonregulated Midwest gas generation results; and 
                
    Incremental shares issued to complete the Progress Energy merger (impacts per diluted share amounts only).

  Regulated Utilities   

           (a) 
    For Duke Energy Progress, 26,634 Gigawatt-hours (GWh) sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, occurred prior to the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. 
              (b) 
    For Duke Energy Florida, 18,348 GWh sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, occurred prior to the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. 
     Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Regulated Utilities  results were positively impacted by higher retail pricing and rate riders, favorable weather, an increase in wholesale power margins, higher weather-normal sales volumes, and 2013 impairments and other charges. These impacts were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher operation and maintenance costs, higher interest expense, and higher income tax expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $614 million increase in fuel revenues driven primarily by increased demand from electric retail customers resulting from favorable weather conditions, and higher fuel rates for electric retail customers for all jurisdictions, except North Carolina. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers; 
                
    A $556 million net increase in retail pricing primarily due to retail rate changes and updated rate riders; 
                
    A $216 million increase in electric sales (net of fuel revenue) to retail customers due to more favorable weather conditions. (i) For the year ended December 31, 2014 in the Carolinas, cooling degree days were 4 percent below normal as compared with 15 percent below normal during the same period in 2013, and heating degree days were 11 percent above normal as compared with 4 percent above normal during the same period in 2013. (ii) For the year ended December 31, 2014 in the Midwest, cooling degree days were 21 percent below normal as compared with 8 percent below normal during the same period in 2013, and heating degree days were 18 percent above normal as compared with 7 percent above normal during the same period in 2013. (iii) For the year ended December 31, 2014 in Florida, cooling degree days were 3 percent below normal as compared with 2 percent above normal during the same period in 2013, and heating degree days were 4 percent above normal as compared with 35 percent below normal during the same period in 2013; 
                
    A $63 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to additional volumes and capacity charges for customers served under long-term contracts; and 
                
    A $21 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers (net of fuel revenue) reflecting increased demand. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $139 million     decrease in gross receipts tax revenue due to the NC Tax Simplification and Rate Reduction Act which terminated the collection of the North Carolina gross receipts tax effective July 1, 2014. 
       39 

PART II 

   Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $611 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily related to (i) higher volumes of coal, and oil     used in electric generation due primarily to increased generation resulting from favorable weather conditions, (ii) higher natural gas     prices, and (iii) the application of the Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) settlement proceeds in 2013 for Duke Energy Florida;  
                
    A $436 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to increases in depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of regulatory assets, and higher 2013 reductions to cost of removal reserves in accordance with regulatory orders; and 
                
    A $292 million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to a litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the Dan River coal ash spill (See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information), higher storm costs, repairs and remediation expenses associated with the Dan River coal ash discharge and other ash basin related assessment costs, and higher nuclear costs, including nuclear outage levelization costs, and higher environmental and operational costs that are recoverable in rates; partially offset by a 2013 Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Station (Crystal River Unit 3) related settlement matter, decreased benefits costs     and 2013 donations for low-income customers and job training in accordance with 2013 North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) and Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) rate case orders.  
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $346 million decrease due to the 2013 impairment and other charges primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and the proposed Levy Nuclear Station (Levy). See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information; 
                
    A $42 million decrease in property and other taxes primarily due to the termination of the collection of the North Carolina gross receipts tax as mentioned above; partially offset by a sales tax reserve as a result of an Indiana sales tax audit, and higher property taxes; and 
                
    A $22 million decrease due to the 2013 impairment resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at Shearon Harris Nuclear Station (Harris). 
     Other Income and Expenses, net.   The variance     is primarily due to recognition of post in-service equity returns for projects that had been completed prior to being reflected in customer rates, partially offset by lower AFUDC   equity, primarily due to placing the Sutton plant into service in late 2013. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance     was primarily due to no longer recording post in-service debt returns on projects now reflected in customer rates     and a reduction in debt return on the Crystal River 3 regulatory asset now recovered through fuel revenues. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to higher pretax income and partially offset by a lower effective tax rate of 36.8 percent compared to 37.8 percent, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable audit settlements, a higher manufacturing deduction due to prior year limitations based on taxable income, and changes in income apportionment for state income tax, partially offset by the non-deductible litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the Dan River coal ash spill. 
  Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 
  Regulated Utilities  results were positively impacted by 2012 impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant, higher retail pricing and rate riders, the inclusion of Progress Energy results for the first six months of 2013, a net increase in wholesale power revenues, and higher weather-normal sales volumes. These impacts were partially offset by higher income tax expense, Crystal River Unit 3 charges, lower AFUDC   equity and higher depreciation and amortization expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
              
    A $434 million net increase in retail pricing primarily due to revised rates approved in all jurisdictions; 
                
    A $76 million net increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to additional volumes and charges for capacity for customers served under long-term contracts; and 
                
    A $72 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers (net of fuel revenue) reflecting increased demand. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $132 million decrease in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by (i) the impact of lower Florida residential fuel rates, including amortization associated with the settlement agreement approved by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) in 2012 (2012 Settlement), (ii) lower fuel rates for electric retail customers in the Carolinas, Florida and Ohio, and (iii) lower revenues for purchased power, partially offset by (iv) increased demand from electric retail customers. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
              
    A $346 million increase in impairment and other charges in 2013 primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy, and 
       40 

PART II 

A $102 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense as allowed under the 2012 Settlement. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $600 million decrease due to 2012 impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information, and 
                
    A $120 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily related to (i) the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds in Florida, including amortization associated with the 2012 Settlement; (ii) lower purchased power costs in (a) the Carolinas, primarily due to additional generating capacity placed in service in late 2012 and market conditions, (b) Ohio, primarily due to reduced sales volumes, and (c) Indiana, reflective of market conditions; partially offset by (iii) higher volumes of natural gas used in electric generation due primarily to additional generating capacity placed in service; (iv) higher prices for natural gas and coal used in electric generation; and (v) higher volumes of coal used in electric generation primarily due to generation mix. 
     Other Income and Expenses, net.   The decrease is primarily due to lower AFUDC equity, resulting from major projects that were placed into service in late 2012 and the implementation of new customer rates related to the IGCC rider, partially offset by the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was primarily driven by the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.8 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in pretax income and a reduction in AFUDC equity. 
  Matters Impacting Future Regulated Utilities Results 
  On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at the retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy is a party to multiple lawsuits filed in regards to the Dan River coal ash release and operations at other North Carolina facilities with ash basins. The outcome of these lawsuits could have an adverse impact to Regulated Utilities  financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information.  
  An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact to the Regulated Utilities' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Notes   5   and   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies  and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively, for additional information. 
  In 2015, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) is examining intervenors' allegations that the Edwardsport IGCC was not properly placed in commercial operation in June 2013 and intervenors  allegations regarding plant performance. In addition, the Indiana Court of Appeals remanded the IURC order in the ninth IGCC rider proceeding back to the IURC for further findings concerning approximately $61 million of financing charges Joint Intervenors claimed were caused by construction delay and a ratemaking issue concerning the in-service date determination for tax purposes. The outcome of these proceedings could have an adverse impact to Regulated Utilities' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Duke Energy cannot predict on the outcome of these proceedings. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information.

PART II 

   International Energy   

  Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  International Energy s results were negatively impacted by higher tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate historical undistributed foreign earnings, unfavorable hydrology and exchange rates in Brazil and an unplanned outage in Chile, partially offset by higher equity earnings in National Methanol Company (NMC) and a 2013 net currency remeasurement loss in Latin America. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $44 million decrease in Peru as a result of lower sales volumes and unfavorable exchange rates; 
                
    A $35 million decrease in Brazil due to unfavorable exchange rates and lower sales volumes partially offset by higher average prices; 
                
    A $27 million decrease in Chile as a result of lower sales volumes due to an unplanned outage, and lower average prices; and  
                
    A $25 million decrease in Argentina due to unfavorable exchange rates and lower average prices. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $75 million increase in Brazil due to higher purchased power as a result of unfavorable hydrology, partially offset by favorable exchange rates. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $38 million decrease in Peru as a result of lower purchased power, transmission, and royalty costs; and 
                
    A $26 million decrease in Argentina due to favorable exchange rates and lower purchased power and fuel consumption. 
     Other Income and Expenses, net  .   The variance is primarily due to a 2013 net currency remeasurement loss in Latin America, higher interest income in Brazil, and higher equity earnings in NMC as a result of increased methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and methanol sales volumes, partially offset by lower average prices and higher butane costs. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to approximately $373 million of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate all cumulative historical undistributed foreign earnings at that time. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 87.3 percent and 28.3 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was also primarily due to the tax expense associated with the repatriation decision. 
  Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 
  International Energy s results were negatively impacted by an extended outage at NMC and unfavorable exchange rates in Latin America, partially offset by the acquisition of Iberoamericana de Energ a Ibener, S.A. (Ibener) in 2012 and higher average prices and lower purchased power costs in Brazil. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
    42 

PART II 

   Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $67 million decrease in Brazil due to weakening of the Real to the U.S. dollar, 
                
    A $53 million decrease in Central America due to lower average prices and volumes, and 
                
    An $18 million decrease in Argentina as a result of unfavorable exchange rates. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $67 million increase in Brazil due to higher average prices, net of lower volumes, and 
      Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $65 million decrease in Central America due to lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher purchased power and coal consumption, and 
                
    A $20 million decrease in Brazil due to weakening of the Real to the U.S. dollar and lower purchased power partially offset by higher variable costs. 
     Partially offset by: 
   Other Income and Expenses, net.   The decrease was primarily driven by a net currency remeasurement loss in Latin America due to strengthening of the dollar, and lower equity earnings at NMC as a result of lower MTBE average prices and lower volumes due to extended maintenance, partially offset by lower butane costs. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was primarily due to the Chile acquisitions in 2012, partially offset by favorable exchange rates and lower inflation in Brazil. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 28.3 percent and 24.8 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in countries with higher tax rates. 
  Matters Impacting Future International Energy Results 
  International Energy's operations include conventional hydroelectric power generation facilities located in Brazil where water reservoirs are currently at abnormally low levels due to a lack of rainfall.  In addition, International Energy s equity earnings from NMC reflect sales of methanol and MTBEs, which generates margins that are directionally correlated with crude oil prices. International Energy's earnings and future cash flows could be adversely impacted by either a sustained period of low reservoir levels, especially if the government of Brazil were to implement rationing or some other mandatory conservation program, or a significant decrease in crude oil prices. 
    43 

PART II 

   Commercial Power   

  Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Commercial Power s results were impacted by higher production tax credits generation, higher production and lower operating costs by the renewables business and a prior-year loss recognized on certain renewables projects, partially offset by an impairment recorded for an intangible asset. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    An $8 million decrease in electric revenues for the Beckjord station, which is not included in the Disposal Group, driven from lower production as units have been retired; 
                
    A $7 million decrease in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power hedge contracts. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
     A $16 million increase in electric revenues from higher production in the renewables portfolio. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $94 million increase driven by an impairment taken related to Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). See Note   11   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  for additional information. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    An $18 million decrease in depreciation driven by discontinued amortization of an intangible asset that was impaired and written off in 2014 and extensions on the projected useful lives of assets in the renewable portfolio;  
                
    A $17 million decrease in fuel expense for the Beckjord station driven by lower cost of coal from decreased production as units have been retired; 
                
    A $16 million decrease related to a 2013 legal settlement reserve related to previously disposed businesses; 
                
    A $10 million decrease in general and administrative costs; 
                
    A $9 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense for the renewables portfolio driven primarily by development cost reductions; and 
                
    A $6 million decrease in property tax expense driven by cost reductions in the renewables portfolio resulting from a property tax abatement that went into effect in the current year. 
     Losses on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net.   The variance is attributable to a loss recognized on the sale of certain renewable development projects in 2013. 
  Other Income and Expense.   The variance was primarily due to a net gain recognized for the sale of certain renewable development assets and increased equity earnings from higher production in the renewable wind portfolio. 
  Income Tax Benefit.   The variance was primarily due to changes in state deferred taxes and higher production tax credits in 2014 for the Renewables portfolio. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 75.5 percent and 62.8 percent, respectively.  
    44 

PART II 

   Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 
  Commercial Power s results were negatively impacted by the sale of non-core business operations and lower income from the renewables portfolio and Beckjord generating station. These impacts are partially offset by higher income tax benefits. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    An $81 million decrease due primarily to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012; and 
                
    A $35 million decrease in electric revenues for the Beckjord station driven from lower production as units were prepared for retirement; 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $67 million increase due to higher volumes in the renewables portfolio. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $34 million increase in operations and maintenance expense for the renewables portfolio driven primarily by commercial operation of certain assets and costs to run the renewables services company acquired in 2012; 
                
    A $25 million increase in depreciation driven by renewable portfolio assets put in service; 
                
    A $17 million increase related to Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) and PJM Transmission System Enhancement obligations; and 
                
    A $16 million increase related to a 2013 legal settlement reserve related to previously disposed businesses. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $56 million decrease due primarily to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012; 
                
    A $17 million decrease in general and administrative costs; and  
                
    A $16 million decrease in fuel expense for the Beckjord station, which is not included in the Disposal Group, driven by lower cost of coal from decreased production as units were prepared for retirement; 
     (Losses) Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net.   The variance is attributable to a loss recognized on the sale of certain renewable development projects in 2013 and a gain on the 2012 contribution of certain renewable assets to a joint venture. 
  Other Income and Expense, net.   The variance is primarily due to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012, lower equity earnings from the renewables portfolio, and lower interest income. 
  Income Tax Benefit.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax loss and a decrease in manufacturing deductions combined with higher production tax credits in 2013. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 62.8 percent and 58.4 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the period was primarily due to higher production tax credits in 2013 for the Renewable portfolio. 
  Other   

  Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Other s results were negatively impacted by a decrease in income tax benefit. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The decrease was primarily due to mark-to-market activity of mitigation sales related to the Progress Energy merger. 
    45 

PART II 

   Operating Expenses.   The decrease was primarily due to lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger and prior year Crescent Resources LLC (Crescent) litigation reserve, partially offset by unfavorable loss experience at Bison. 
  Other Income and Expenses.   The decrease was primarily due to a gain on the sale of Duke Energy s 50 percent ownership in DukeNet Communications Holdings, LLC (DukeNet) in 2013, partially offset by a current year investment sale gain and higher investment income at Bison Insurance Company Limited (Bison). 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was due primarily to lower interest on long-term debt resulting from debt maturities and new debt issued at lower rates. 
  Income Tax Benefit.   The variance was primarily due to a state tax benefit recognized in 2013. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 41.9 percent and 58.6 percent, respectively.  
  Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 
  Other s results were positively impacted by lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger, the sale of DukeNet, and increased current year activity from mitigation sales related to the Progress Energy merger. These impacts were partially offset by increased interest expense, lower income tax benefit and the Crescent litigation reserve in 2013. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by increased activity from mitigation sales related to the Progress Energy merger and higher premiums earned at Bison as a result of the addition of Progress Energy. 
  Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger, and prior year donations, partially offset by the Crescent litigation reserve in 2013 and unfavorable loss experience at Bison as a result of the addition of Progress Energy. 
  Other Income and Expense  , net.   The variance was driven primarily by a gain on the sale of Duke Energy s 50 percent ownership in DukeNet in 2013. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was due primarily to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013 and additional debt issuances. 
  Income Tax Benefit.   The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 58.6 percent and 42.5 percent, respectively. 
  Matters Impacting Future Other Results 
  Duke Energy previously held an effective 50 percent interest in Crescent Resources, LLC (Crescent). Crescent was a real estate joint venture formed by Duke Energy in 2006 that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2009. On June 9, 2010, Crescent restructured and emerged from bankruptcy and Duke Energy forfeited its entire 50 percent ownership interest to Crescent debt holders. This forfeiture caused Duke Energy to recognize a loss, for tax purposes, on its interest in the second quarter of 2010. Although Crescent has reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy with creditors owning all Crescent interest, there remains uncertainty as to the tax treatment associated with the restructuring. Based on this uncertainty, it is possible that Duke Energy could incur a future tax liability related to the tax losses associated with its partnership interest in Crescent and the resolution of issues associated with Crescent s emergence from bankruptcy. 
  In 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision holding that Duke Energy is responsible for costs associated with Multi Value Projects (MVP), a type of Transmission Expansion Planning (MTEP) cost, approved by MISO prior to the date of Duke Energy s withdrawal. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. If FERC upholds the initial decision, Duke Energy intends to file an appeal in federal court. If Duke Energy is deemed responsible for these costs, and if a portion of these costs are not eligible for recovery, there may be an adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information. 
  INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX 
  Discontinued Operations decreased $662 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $929 million pretax write-down of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated fair value of the Disposal Group, based on the transaction price included in the PSA, less estimated costs to sell and a $134 million pretax mark-to-market loss on economic hedges for the Disposal Group. Included in the variance is the $117 million impact of ceasing depreciation on the assets of the Disposal Group beginning in the second quarter of 2014. 
  Discontinued Operations decreased $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared capacity auction pricing for the Disposal Group.

   DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS 
  Introduction 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31,   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  . 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Carolinas is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 
  Results of Operations   

  The following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Carolinas. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales, and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather normalized.   

  Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $180 million increase in retail pricing and updated rate riders, which primarily reflects the impact of the 2013 North Carolina and South Carolina retail rate cases;  
                
    A $151 million increase in fuel revenues driven primarily by increased demand from retail customers, mainly due to favorable weather conditions. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers; 
                
    A $99 million increase in electric sales (net of fuel revenues) to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions. Heating degree days in 2014 were 11 percent above normal compared to 5 percent above normal during the same period in 2013 and cooling degree days were 6 percent below normal as compared to 17 percent below normal in 2013;  
                
    A $19 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to new customers; and 
                
    An $18 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers reflecting increased demand. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $79 million decrease in gross receipts tax revenue due to the NC Tax Simplification and Rate Reduction Act which terminated the collection of the North Carolina gross receipts tax effective July 1, 2014. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $151 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily due to increased retail demand resulting from favorable weather conditions; 
                
    A $127 million increase in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to a litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the Dan River coal ash spill (See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information), repairs and remediation expenses associated with the Dan River coal ash discharge and other ash basin related assessment costs, higher non-outage costs at generation plants, higher storm costs, higher distribution costs, higher nuclear outage expense including the impacts of nuclear levelization, and higher energy efficiency program costs, partially offset by decreased corporate costs and lower costs associated with the Progress Energy merger; and  
       47 

PART II 

An $88 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of certain regulatory assets, partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to reductions for costs of removal in accordance with the 2013 North Carolina and South Carolina rate case orders. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $58 million decrease in property and other tax expenses primarily due to lower revenue related taxes driven by the elimination of North Carolina gross receipts tax effective July 1, 2014, partially offset by higher property tax expense.  
     Other Income and Expenses, net.   The variance was primarily due to the recognition of post in-service equity returns for projects that had been completed prior to being reflected in customer rates. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was primarily due to no longer recording post in-service debt returns on projects now reflected in customer rates, partially offset by lower interest on bonds. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 35.4 percent and 37.8 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable audit settlements, changes in apportionment related to state income tax and the tax benefit related to the manufacturing deduction in 2014 as the prior year deduction was limited by taxable income, partially offset by the non-deductible litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the Dan River coal ash spill. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at the retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy is a party to multiple lawsuits filed in regards to the Dan River coal ash release and operations at other North Carolina facilities with ash basins. The outcome of these lawsuits could have an adverse impact to Duke Energy Carolinas  financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information. 
  An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact to Duke Energy Carolinas' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Notes   5   and   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies  and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively, for additional information.

  Results of Operations   

  Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
    48 

PART II 

A $341 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by increased demand from wholesale and retail customers, partially resulting from favorable weather conditions, and higher fuel rates for wholesale customers reflective of higher fuel costs for Duke Energy Progress; and to a higher fuel rate in the current year related to lower NEIL insurance reimbursements and accelerated Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset cost recovery in 2014 as allowed by the 2013 Settlement for Duke Energy Florida. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers; 
                
    A $149 million increase in retail pricing, which primarily reflects the impact of the 2013 North Carolina retail rate case in North Carolina and the 2014 base rate increase in Florida; and 
                
    A $114 million increase (net of fuel revenue) in GWh sales to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions. For Duke Energy Progress, heating degree days in 2014 were 11 percent above normal compared to 2 percent above normal in 2013 and cooling degree days were 2 percent below normal compared to 13 percent below normal in 2013. For Duke Energy Florida, heating degree days in 2014 were 51 percent higher and cooling degree days were 4 percent lower compared to the same period in 2013 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $344 million increase in fuel expenses (including purchased power). For Duke Energy Florida the increase is due to the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds in 2013 and higher sales volumes driven by increased demand and higher fuel prices in the current year. For Duke Energy Progress the increase is primarily due to increased sales volumes; 
                
    A $245 million increase in depreciation and amortization. For Duke Energy Florida the increase is primarily due to a reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense in 2013 as allowed under the 2012 Settlement, increased environmental cost recovery clause amortization related to prior year under-recovery and nuclear cost recovery clause amortization due to an increase in recoverable nuclear assets in the current year. For Duke Energy Progress the increase is primarily due to higher depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of certain regulatory assets and a prior year reversal of a portion of cost of removal reserves in accordance with the 2013 NCUC rate case order; and 
                
    An $88 million increase in operations, maintenance and other expense primarily due to a litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the management of North Carolina coal ash basins (See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information).  
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $346 million decrease due to 2013 impairment and other charges at Duke Energy Florida primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy; and 
                
    A $49 million decrease at Duke Energy Progress due to a current year $18 million reduction to a 2012 impairment charge related to the disallowance of transmission project costs, which are a portion of the Long-Term FERC Mitigation and a $22 million prior-year impairment charge resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at the Harris nuclear station. 
     Other Income and Expense, net.   The variance was primarily due to lower AFUDC   equity as a result of assets placed into service, partially offset by post in-service equity returns for projects that had been completed prior to being reflected in customer rates. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 38.0 percent and 36.2 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in AFUDC   equity and the non-deductible litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the management of North Carolina coal ash basins. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas' retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River.

Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales, and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather normalized.   

  Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $104 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by increased demand from wholesale and retail customers, partially resulting from favorable weather conditions, and higher fuel rates for wholesale customers reflective of higher fuel costs. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers; 
                
    An $82 million increase (net of fuel revenue) in electric sales to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions. Heating degree days in 2014 were 11 percent above normal compared to 2 percent above normal in 2013 and cooling degree days were 2 percent below normal compared to 13 percent below normal in 2013; and 
                
    An $80 million increase in retail pricing, which primarily reflects the impact of the 2013 North Carolina retail rate case. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $60 million decrease in gross receipts tax revenue due to the NC Tax Simplification and Rate Reduction Act which terminated the collection of the North Carolina gross receipts tax effective July 1, 2014; and  
                
    A $19 million decrease in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers reflecting decreased demand. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $111 million increase in fuel expenses (including purchased power) primarily due to increased sales volumes;  
                
    A $113 million increase in operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to a litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the management of North Carolina coal ash basins (See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information), the impacts of amortization on nuclear levelization outage deferrals and higher storm costs, partially offset by prior year donations for low-income customers and job training in accordance with the 2013 NCUC rate case order and lower costs to achieve the merger with Duke Energy including severance and employee relocation expenses; and  
       50 

PART II 

A $48 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily due to higher depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of certain regulatory assets and a prior year reversal of a portion of cost of removal reserves in accordance with the 2013 NCUC rate case order. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $49 million decrease in property and other tax expenses primarily due to lower revenue related taxes driven by the elimination of North Carolina gross receipts tax effective July 1, 2014, partially offset by higher property tax expense; and 
                
    A $40 million decrease due to a current year $18 million reduction to a 2012 impairment charge related to the disallowance of transmission project costs, which are a portion of the Long-Term FERC Mitigation and a $22 million prior-year impairment charge resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at the Harris nuclear station.  
     Interest Expense.   The variance was primarily due to a new debt issuance, no longer recording post in-service debt returns on projects now reflected in customer rates and lower AFUDC   debt due to projects placed in service. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 37.9 percent and 36.5 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the non-deductible litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the management of North Carolina coal ash basins.

PART II 

   Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $237 million increase in fuel and capacity revenues primarily due to a higher fuel rate in the current year related to lower NEIL insurance reimbursements and accelerated Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset cost recovery in 2014 as allowed by the 2013 Settlement. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers; 
                
    A $69 million net increase in base revenues due primarily to the 2014 base rate increase; 
                
    A $63 million increase in nuclear cost recovery clause and energy conservation cost recovery clause revenues due to higher recovery rates in the current year;  
                
    A $32 million increase in electric sales (net of fuel revenue) to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions. Heating degree days in 2014 were 51 percent higher and cooling degree days were 4 percent lower compared to the same period in 2013; and  
                
    A $29 million increase in wholesale power revenues primarily driven by increased capacity rates partially offset by the impact of contracts that expired in 2013. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $231 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power due to the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds in 2013 and higher sales volumes driven by increased demand and higher fuel prices in the current year; 
                
    A $215 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to a reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense in 2013 as allowed under the 2012 Settlement, increased environmental cost recovery clause amortization related to prior year under-recovery and nuclear cost recovery clause amortization due to an increase in recoverable nuclear assets in the current year; and 
                
    A $16 million increase in property and other taxes primarily driven by higher revenue-related taxes in 2014 due to the higher revenues. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $346 million decrease due to 2013 impairment and other charges primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy; and 
                
    A $48 million decrease in operations and maintenance costs primarily due to prior year Crystal River Unit 3 related settlement matters and lower costs associated with Progress Energy s merger with Duke Energy. These costs were partially offset by increased expenses that are recoverable under the energy conservation and environmental cost recovery clauses. 
     Other Income and Expense, net.   The variance is driven by lower AFUDC return on the Levy projects in the current year. 
  Interest Expense.   The increase is due to a lower debt return in 2014 driven by the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset impairment in 2013 and accelerated Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset cost recovery in 2014 as allowed by the 2013 Settlement. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 38.9 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively.

  The following table shows the percent changes in Regulated Utilities' GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Ohio. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales, and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather normalized.   

  Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $56 million increase in regulated fuel revenues primarily driven by higher fuel costs and increased sales volumes;  
                
    A $51 million increase in retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to 2013 rate increases; and 
                
    A $9 million increase in volumes to retail customers. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    An $8 million decrease in electric revenues for the Beckjord station driven from lower production as units have been retired; and 
                
    A $7 million decrease in net mark-to-market revenue on non-qualifying power hedge contracts. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $94 million impairment taken related to OVEC. See Note   11   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  for additional information; and 
                
    A $64 million increase in regulated fuel expense driven primarily by higher fuel costs and increased volumes. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A $30 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower corporate governance costs; 
                
    A $16 million decrease in nonregulated fuel expense for the Beckjord station driven by lower cost of coal from decreased production as units have been retired; and 
                
    An $8 million decrease in property and other taxes driven primarily by an Ohio gas excise tax settlement in 2014. 
       53 

PART II 

   Interest Expense.   The increase was primarily due to higher regulated average debt balances in 2014 compared to 2013 and higher intercompany interest expense related to the funds loaned from Cinergy to Duke Energy  Commercial Asset Management, Inc. (DECAM). 
  Income Tax Expense.   The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 38.9 percent and 39.1 percent, respectively.  
  Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax.   The variance was primarily due to the impairment recognized for the nonregulated Midwest generation business. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  On February 17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Duke Energy Ohio expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business in the second quarter of 2015. Duke Energy Ohio recognized a pretax impairment charge of $886 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which represents the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the business based on the transaction price included in the PSA, less estimated costs to sell. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2015 and the impairment will be updated, if necessary, based on the final sales price, after any adjustments at closing for working capital and capital expenditures. 
  In 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision that Duke Energy Ohio is responsible for costs associated with certain MVP costs, a type of MTEP cost, approved by MISO prior to the date of Duke Energy Ohio s withdrawal. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. If FERC upholds the initial decision, Duke Energy Ohio intends to file an appeal in federal court. If Duke Energy Ohio is deemed responsible for these costs, and if a portion of these costs are not eligible for recovery, there may be an adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information.

  The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Indiana is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 
  Results of Operations   

  The following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Indiana. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales, and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather normalized.   

  Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to 2013 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $138 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) due to an increase in fuel rates as a result of higher fuel and purchased power costs;  
                
    An $86 million net increase in rate riders primarily due to updates to the IGCC rider; and 
                
    A $17 million increase in wholesale power revenues primarily due to higher customer rates.

PART II 

   Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    A $128 million increase in fuel costs primarily driven by higher fuel and purchased power costs;  
                
    A $71 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of the Edwardsport IGCC plant being placed into service in the second quarter of 2013;  
                
    A $57 million increase in property and other taxes, primarily as a result of amounts recorded related to an Indiana sales tax audit; and 
                
    A $21 million increase in operation and maintenance primarily due to higher operation and maintenance costs, higher outage costs at generation plants, partially offset by decreased corporate costs. 
     Income Tax Expense.   The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 35.5 percent and 38.4 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the Indiana statutory corporate state income tax rate, a more favorable state tax credit, and a prior period adjustment. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  Duke Energy Indiana is evaluating converting Wabash River Unit 6 to a natural gas-fired unit or retiring the unit earlier than its current estimated useful life. If Duke Energy Indiana elects early retirement of the unit, recovery of remaining book values and associated carrying costs totaling approximately $40 million could be subject to future regulatory approvals and therefore cannot be assured. 
  In 2015, the IURC is examining intervenors' allegations that the Edwardsport IGCC was not properly placed in commercial operation in June 2013 and intervenors  allegations regarding plant performance. In addition, the Indiana Court of Appeals remanded the IURC order in the ninth IGCC rider proceeding back to the IURC for further findings concerning approximately $61 million of financing charges Joint Intervenors claimed were caused by construction delay and a ratemaking issue concerning the in-service date determination for tax purposes. The outcome of these proceedings could have an adverse impact to Duke Energy Indiana s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Duke Energy cannot predict on the outcome of these proceedings. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information. 
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  Preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs.  
  Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. 
  Regulatory Accounting 
  A substantial majority of Regulated Utilities, Duke Energy s regulated operations, meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy records assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or for costs that have yet to be incurred. 
  Management continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy s jurisdictions, litigation of rate orders, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. For further information on regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters.  
  As required by regulated operations accounting, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable cost is considered to be an entity specific cost recoverable in future rates and therefore a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability. 
  Regulatory accounting rules also require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. For example, if a cost cap is set for a plant still under construction, the amount of the disallowance is a result of a judgment as to the ultimate cost of the plant. Other disallowances can require judgments on allowed future rate recovery. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for a discussion of disallowances recorded related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant and the retired Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Station.  
  When it becomes probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable. The impairment for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows.

PART II 

   As discussed in Note   2   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,    Acquisitions, Dispositions and Sales of Other Assets  ,  Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded disallowance charges in 2012 in order to gain FERC approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. In addition to the disallowances, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress guaranteed total fuel savings to customers in North Carolina and South Carolina of $687 million over the five years in order to gain NCUC and PSCSC approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Based on current estimates of future fuel costs, Duke Energy anticipates that it will meet the guaranteed fuel savings. However, if actual fuel costs are higher than expected, Duke Energy could record a charge for the unmet guaranteed savings. 
  Goodwill Impairment Assessments 
  Duke Energy allocates goodwill to reporting units, which are determined to be an operating segment or one level below based on how the segment is managed. Duke Energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Duke Energy performs its annual impairment test as of August 31. 
  Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for Duke Energy s business and the fair value of debt. 
  Estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on Duke Energy s internal business plan, and adjusted as appropriate for Duke Energy s views of market participant assumptions. Duke Energy s internal business plan reflects management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third-party sources, projected commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations. The business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of returns on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to significant future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service, the renewal of certain contracts and the future of renewable tax credits. Management also makes assumptions regarding operation, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. In estimating cash flows, Duke Energy incorporates expected growth rates, regulatory and economic stability, the ability to renew contracts and other factors, into its revenue and expense forecasts. 
  One of the most significant assumptions that Duke Energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the   2014   impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31,   2014  , for each of Duke Energy s domestic reporting units ranged from 5.3 percent to 6.9 percent. 
  For Duke Energy s international operations, a country-specific risk adder based on the average risk premium for each separate country in which International Energy operates was added to the base discount rate to reflect the differing risk profiles. This resulted in a discount rate for the August 31,   2014   goodwill impairment test for the international operations of 10.5 percent. 
  The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges. 
  The majority of Duke Energy s business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, changes in discount rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of equity. 
  As of August 31,   2014  , all of the reporting units  estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by more than 10 percent. 
  Long-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated Operations 
  Property, plant and equipment, excluding plant held for sale, is stated at the lower of carrying value (historical cost less accumulated depreciation and previously recorded impairments) or fair value, if impaired. Duke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections, the determination that it is more likely than not an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value. 
  Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the asset and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value of the asset requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less cost to sell to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. 
  When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.

   For further information related to the impairment recorded in conjunction with planned sale of Duke Energy's Disposal Group to Dynegy, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisition, Disposals and Sales of Other Assets,"  
  Accounting for Loss Contingencies 
  Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures require judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events. Duke Energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters arising in the normal course of business. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties, such as federal, state and local courts and other regulators. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved, which could have a material impact on future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy. 
  For further information, see Notes 4 and   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and  Commitments and Contingencies.  
  Revenue Recognition  
  Revenues on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered. Operating revenues include unbilled electric and gas revenues earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period. Unbilled retail revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) for all customer classes to the number of estimated kWh or Mcf delivered but not billed. Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per megawatt-hour (MWh) to the number of estimated MWh delivered but not yet billed. Unbilled wholesale demand revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per megawatt (MW) to the MW volume delivered but not yet billed. The amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors, including seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer mix and the average price in effect for customer classes.  
  Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits 
  The calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Additionally, the health care cost trend rate assumption is critical to Duke Energy s estimate of other post-retirement benefits. 
  Duke Energy has historically utilized the Society of Actuaries  (SOA) published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension obligation (qualified and non-qualified) and other post-retirement benefit obligation. On October 27, 2014, the SOA published updated mortality tables for U.S. plans (RP-2014) and an updated improvement scale, which both reflect improved longevity. Based on an evaluation of the mortality experience of Duke Energy's pension plan participants, the updated SOA study of mortality tables and recent additional studies of mortality improvement, Duke Energy adopted an adjusted version of the SOA's new RP-2014 mortality tables with an updated generational improvement scale (BB-2D) previously published by the SOA for purposes of measuring its U.S. pension (qualified and non-qualified) and other post-retirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2014. The change to the mortality assumption increased Duke Energy's pension obligation (qualified and non-qualified) and other post-retirement benefit obligation by $201 million and $7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. 
  Duke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active covered employees. Prior service cost or credit, which represents the effect on plan liabilities due to plan amendments, is amortized over the average remaining service period of active covered employees. 
  Duke Energy maintains non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S. employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings based on age and years of service and current interest credits. Certain employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula. 
  Duke Energy provides some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. 
  As of   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the pension liability. Hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments. In 2013, Duke Energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for its pension assets. As the funded status of the plans increase, over time the targeted allocation to return seeking assets will be reduced and the targeted allocation to fixed-income assets will be increased to better manage Duke Energy's pension liability and reduced funded status volatility. Based on the current funded status of the plans, the asset allocation for the Duke Energy pension plans has been adjusted to 65 percent fixed-income assets and 35 percent return-seeking assets and the asset allocation for the Progress Energy pension plans has been adjusted to 60 percent fixed-income assets and 40 percent return-seeking assets. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate. 
  The assets for Duke Energy s pension and other post-retirement plans are maintained in a master trust. Duke Energy also invests other post-retirement assets in the Duke Energy Corporation Employee Benefits Trust (VEBA I). The investment objective of VEBA I is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants. VEBA I is passively managed.  
    57 

PART II 

   Duke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 4.1 percent as of   December 31, 2014  . Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to match the timing of projected benefit payments. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected. 
  Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy s pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy s   2014   pretax pension expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25 percent change in rates were to occur.   

  Duke Energy s U.S. other post-retirement plan uses a health care trend rate covering both pre- and post-age 65 retired plan participants, which is comprised of a medical care trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in medical costs, and a prescription drug trend rate, which reflects the near and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug costs. As of   December 31, 2014  , the health care trend rate was 6.75 percent, trending down to 4.75 percent by 2023. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy s   2014   pretax other post-retirement expense and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 1 percentage point change in the health care trend rate were to occur.   

  For further information, see Note   21   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,    Employee Benefit Plans  .  
    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its domestic liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Duke Energy s projected primary sources and uses for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.   

           (a) 
    Excludes capital leases and securitized receivables maturities in 2016 and 2017 expected to be renewed. Amounts represent Duke Energy's financing plan, which accelerates certain contractual maturities. 
              (b) 
    Cash flows from operations includes expenditures related to ash basin closures. 
     Duke Energy expects the sale of the Disposal group to Dynegy to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2015. The sale price is $2.8 billion in cash subject to adjustments at closing for changes in working capital and capital expenditures. Upon closing of the transaction, Duke Energy intends to execute a balanced recapitalization strategy with the proceeds. The recapitalization is expected to include a combination of an accelerated share repurchase and debt reduction through avoidance of holding company debt issuances in 2015. The ultimate use of proceeds will depend on facts and circumstances at the time of the closing. For further information on the Midwest Generation Exit, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Acquisitions, Dispositions and Sales of Other Assets."   
    58 

PART II 

   In December 2014, Duke Energy declared a taxable dividend of historical foreign earnings in the form of notes payable that will result in the repatriation of approximately $2.7 billion of cash held and expected to be generated by International Energy over a period of up to eight years. Between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion will be remitted in 2015, with the remaining amount remitted by 2022. The proceeds of the dividend will principally be used to support Duke Energy's dividend and growth in the domestic business. 
  The Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Debt and Credit Facilities,  for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement. 
  Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy s current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its business. 
  Credit Facilities and Registration Statements 
  Master Credit Facility Summary 
  At December 31, 2014, Duke Energy had a Master Credit Facility with a capacity of $6 billion. In January 2015, Duke Energy amended the Master Credit Facility to increase its capacity to $7.5 billion through January 2020. The Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, each have borrowing capacity under the Master Credit Facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the Master Credit Facility has been reduced to backstop the issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder. The table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under the Master Credit Facility.   

           (a) 
    Represents the sublimit of each borrower at   December 31, 2014  . The Duke Energy Ohio sublimit includes $100 million for Duke Energy Kentucky. 
              (b) 
    Duke Energy issued $475 million of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. The balances are included within Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     On   February 20, 2015  , Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Business Services LLC (DEBS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, each entered into a Memorandum of Plea Agreement (Plea Agreements) in connection with the investigation initiated by the United States Department of Justice Environmental Crimes Section and the United States Attorneys for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the Middle District of North Carolina and the Western District of North Carolina (collectively, the USDOJ). Under the terms of the Plea Agreements, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are required to each maintain $250 million of available capacity under the Master Credit Facility as security to meet their obligations under the Plea Agreements, in addition to certain other conditions set out in the Plea Agreements. The Plea Agreements are subject to court approval. See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information. 
  PremierNotes 
  Duke Energy has an effective registration statement (Form S-3) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell up to $3 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor s option at any time. The balance as of   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , was $968 million and $836 million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Shelf Registration 
  In September 2013, Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by Duke Energy. 
    59 

PART II 

   CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
  Duke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors. Based on this goal, the majority of Duke Energy s total projected capital expenditures are allocated to the Regulated Utilities segment. Duke Energy s projected capital and investment expenditures for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.   

    DEBT MATURITIES 
  The following table shows the significant components of Current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Duke Energy Registrants currently anticipate satisfying these obligations with cash on hand and proceeds from additional borrowings.   

    DIVIDEND PAYMENTS 
  In 2014, Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 88th consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
  The Board of Directors continues to target a payout ratio of 65 percent to 70 percent, based upon adjusted diluted EPS. Over the past several years, Duke Energy s dividend has grown at approximately 2 percent annually, slower than overall adjusted earnings growth. Duke Energy has now achieved the targeted payout range and believes it has the flexibility to grow the dividend at a pace more consistent with adjusted earnings growth.  
    60 

PART II 

   Dividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries 
  As discussed in Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Regulatory Matters,  Duke Energy s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy via dividend, advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation which, in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At   December 31, 2014  , the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend is less than 25 percent of Duke Energy s net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations. 
    CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
  The relatively stable operating cash flows of Regulated Utilities compose a substantial portion of Duke Energy s cash flows from operations. Regulated Utilities  cash flows from operations are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas and costs of operations. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unplanned plant outages and storms can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.  
  Duke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  for additional information). 
  At   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.0 billion, of which approximately $1.7 billion is held by entities domiciled in foreign jurisdictions. During 2014, Duke Energy declared a taxable dividend of historical foreign earnings in the form of notes payable that will result in the repatriation of approximately $2.7 billion of cash held and expected to be generated by International Energy over a period of up to eight years. As a result of the decision to repatriate all cumulative historic undistributed foreign earnings, during the fourth quarter of 2014, Duke Energy recorded U. S. income tax expense of approximately $373 million. Duke Energy s intention is to indefinitely reinvest prospective undistributed earnings generated by Duke Energy's foreign subsidiaries. See Note   22   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Income Taxes,  for additional information. 
    DEBT ISSUANCES 
  Depending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt. 
  Duke Energy s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. The 2015 projected capitalization percentages exclude purchase accounting adjustments of approximately $2.9 billion related to the merger with Progress Energy, while the 2014 and 2013 percentages include all debt-related purchase accounting amounts.   

  Duke Energy s fixed charges coverage ratio, calculated using SEC guidelines, was 3.2 times for   2014  , 3.0 times for   2013  , and 2.4 times for   2012  . 
  Restrictive Debt Covenants 
  Duke Energy s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. The Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65 percent for each borrower. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy was in compliance with all covenants related to its significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.

Credit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold. The Duke Energy Registrants  credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies  assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted. 
  Cash Flow Information 
  The following table summarizes Duke Energy s cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years.   

    OPERATING CASH FLOWS 
  The following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy s operating cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal year.   

  For the year ended   December 31, 2014   compared to   2013  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
    62 

PART II 

            * 
    A $204 million increase due to prior year contributions to qualified pension plans, favorable retail pricing and rate riders and favorable weather, partially offset by current year under collection of fuel and purchased power costs and timing of cash payments for operations and maintenance expenses. 
     For the year ended   December 31, 2013   compared to   2012  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
           * 
    A $2,001 million increase in net income after non-cash adjustments, mainly due to the inclusion of Progress Energy's results for first six months of 2013 and the impact of revised rates and lower operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by; 
              * 
    A $917 million decrease in operating cash flows from increased investments in traditional working capital, mainly due to the timing of receivables and accruals, lower incentive accruals, net of current year payments and reserve reductions and the prior year overallocation of the Carolinas' fuels costs. These decreases were partially offset by the NEIL proceeds. 
       INVESTING CASH FLOWS 
  The following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy s investing cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years.   

  The primary use of cash related to investing activities is capital, investment and acquisition expenditures, detailed by reportable business segment in the following table.   

  For the year ended   December 31, 2014   compared to   2013  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
           * 
    A $192 million return of collateral related to the Chilean hydro acquisition in 2013 and 
              * 
    A $150 million decrease in net proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities, net of purchases. 
     For the year ended   December 31, 2013   compared to   2012  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
           * 
    A $581 million variance in restricted cash due to posting collateral on a secured debt issuance related to the Chilean hydro acquisition in 2012 and the return of a portion of this collateral in 2013, 
              * 
    A $355 million increase in proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities, net of purchases due to the investment of excess cash held in foreign jurisdictions and 
              * 
    A $351 million decrease in capital, investment and acquisition expenditures primarily due to lower spending on Duke Energy's renewable energy projects and ongoing infrastructure modernization program as these projects were completed, net of expenditures on Progress Energy's maintenance projects. 
       FINANCING CASH FLOWS 
  The following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy s financing cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years.   

    63 

PART II 

   For the year ended   December 31, 2014   compared to   2013  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
           * 
    A $1,595 million increase in proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper, primarily due to funding a larger proportion of total financing needs with short-term debt in anticipation of the receipt in 2015 of proceeds from the sale of the Midwest Generation business, the proceeds from which will partially be used for debt reduction, partially offset by; 
              * 
    A $963 million decrease in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to funding a larger proportion of total financing needs with short-term debt in 2014 than in 2013. 
     For the year ended   December 31, 2013   compared to   2012  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
           * 
    An $832 million decrease in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to the timing of issuances and redemptions between years, resulting from the completion of major construction projects, 
               * 
    A $185 million decrease in proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper, primarily due to changes in short-term working capital needs.

     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. 
  Most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital) through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007 spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp (Spectra Energy), having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. 
  Duke Energy performs ongoing assessments of their respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. 
  See Note   7   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Guarantees and Indemnifications,  for further details of the guarantee arrangements. 
  Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
    65 

PART II 

   Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease arrangements, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information on these commitments, see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.  
  Contractual Obligations 
  Duke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes Duke Energy s contractual cash obligations as of   December 31, 2014  .   

           (a) 
    See Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Debt and Credit Facilities.  
              (b) 
    Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using   December 31, 2014   interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments. 
              (c) 
    See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.  Amounts in the table above include the interest component of capital leases based on the interest rates stated in the lease agreements and exclude certain related executory costs. 
              (d) 
    Current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term debt, and purchase obligations reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, have been excluded from the above table. 
              (e) 
    Includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS). For contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at   December 31, 2014  , or the best projections of the index. For certain of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting arrangements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. 
              (f) 
    Includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering, procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and nuclear plant refurbishments, environmental projects on fossil facilities, major maintenance of certain nonregulated plants, maintenance and day to day contract work at certain wind facilities and commitments to buy wind and combustion turbines. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. 
              (g) 
    Related to future annual funding obligations to nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) through nuclear power stations' re-licensing dates. Amounts through 2017 include North Carolina jurisdictional amounts that Duke Energy Progress retained internally and is transitioning to its external decommissioning funds per a 2008 NCUC order. The transition of the original $131 million must be complete by December 31, 2017, and at least 10 percent must be transitioned each year. See Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations." 
              (h) 
    Uncertain tax positions of   $213 million   are not reflected in this table as Duke Energy cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note   22   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Income Taxes." 
              (i) 
    The table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance claims (see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies ) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing and amount of cash payments that will be required. Additionally, the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including nuclear insurance (see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies ), funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (see Note   21   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Employee Benefit Plans"), asset retirement obligations, including ash management expenditures (see Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations") and regulatory liabilities (see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters ) because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. 
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Risk Management Policies 
  Duke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures, and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits. 
    66 

PART II 

   The following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please review Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  and  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets. Duke Energy s exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost-based regulation of its operations in its Regulated Utilities segment as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations. 
  Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note   14   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Derivatives and Hedging.  
  Validation of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from Duke Energy s deal origination function. While Duke Energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in its pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition. 
  Hedging Strategies 
  Duke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. These instruments are also used to optimize the value of the nonregulated generation portfolio. Duke Energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel. 
  The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy s commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings. 
  Duke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as an NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract s fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring. 
  Generation Portfolio Risks  
  Duke Energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power, natural gas, and coal prices in the Regulated Utilities segment. The Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their wholesale and nonregulated generation portfolios. The portfolios include generation assets, fuel, and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units.  
  For the Regulated Utilities segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers.  
  International Energy and Commercial Power generally hedge their expected generation using long-term bilateral power sales contracts when favorable market conditions exist and are subject to wholesale commodity price risks for electricity not sold under such contracts. International Energy dispatches electricity not sold under long-term bilateral contracts into unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from national system operators. Derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond 2015 are also exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power, fuel oil and coal.  
  See  Sensitivity Analysis for Generation Portfolio and Derivative Price Risks  below, for more information regarding the effect of changes in commodity prices on Duke Energy s net income. 
    67 

PART II 

   SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR GENERATION PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE PRICE RISKS 
  The table below summarizes the estimated effect of commodity price changes on Duke Energy s pretax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis performed for the nonregulated generation portfolio. Forecasted exposure to commodity price risk for the Regulated Utilities segment is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy s results of operations in 2015. The following commodity price sensitivity calculations consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels, as indicated in the table below, but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices. 
  Summary of Sensitivity Analysis for Generation Portfolio and Derivative Price Risks (in millions)      

  (a)    Amounts related to forward wholesale prices represent the potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted 
  economic generation which has not been contracted or hedged. Amounts related to forward coal prices and forward gas prices represent the potential impact of commodity price changes on fuel needed to achieve such economic generation. Amounts exclude the impact of mark-to-market changes on undesignated contracts relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date.  
           (b) 
    Amounts represent sensitivities related to derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for periods beyond   2014  . Amounts exclude the potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted economic generation and fuel needed to achieve such forecasted generation.   
     Interest Rate Risk 
  Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes   1  ,   6  ,   14  , and   16   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,   Debt and Credit Facilities,   Derivatives and Hedging,  and  Fair Value Measurements.  
  At   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy had $250 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating swaps outstanding and no pre-issuance hedges outstanding. In the first quarter of 2015, Duke Energy entered into an additional $250 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating swaps. Duke Energy had $6.9 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at   December 31, 2014  . The impact of a 100 basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $72 million at   December 31, 2014  . 
  This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of   December 31, 2014  . 
  Credit Risk 
  Credit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. To reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit them to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable obtaining collateral or terminating or resetting the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit-related events. The Duke Energy Registrants may, at times, use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third-party credit enhancement of their counterparties  obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note   14   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Derivatives and Hedging,  for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants  industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts. The Duke Energy Registrants frequently use master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures. The collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants  internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants  principal customers for its electric and gas businesses are commodity clearinghouses, regional transmission organizations, industrial, commercial and residential end-users, marketers, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. and Latin America. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from such entities throughout these regions. These concentrations of customers may affect the Duke Energy Registrants  overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparties  financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis.  
    68 

PART II 

   Duke Energy Carolinas has a third-party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to its asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention of $476 million. Duke Energy Carolinas  cumulative payments began to exceed the self-insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is $864 million in excess of the self-insured retention. Insurance recoveries of $616 million and $649 million related to this policy are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other within Investments and Other Assets and Receivables as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note   7   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Guarantees and Indemnifications,  for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk of their vendors and suppliers in the form of performance risk on contracts including, but not limited to, outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants  credit exposure to such vendors and suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non-performance.  
  Credit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants  service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring customers to provide a cash deposit or letter of credit until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction, at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through the retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated variable interest entity. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note   17   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Variable Interest Entities.   
  Based on the Duke Energy Registrants  policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.  
  Marketable Securities Price Risk 
  As described further in Note   15   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,  Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 
  Pension Plan Assets 
  Duke Energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. 
  A significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy s results of operations in those periods. 
  Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds 
  As required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of   December 31, 2014  , these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The investments in equity securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes. Accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail rates; therefore, fluctuations in equity prices do not affect their Consolidated Statements of Operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to an Order by the NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail rates. See Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations  for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note   15   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Investments in Debt and Equity Securities  for additional information regarding NDTF assets.

PART II 

   Foreign Currency Risk 
  Duke Energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity-related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the U.S. dollar and/or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency. Duke Energy may also use foreign currency derivatives, where possible, to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations. To monitor its currency exchange rate risks, Duke Energy uses sensitivity analysis, which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure. 
  Duke Energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the Brazilian Real. The table below summarizes the potential effect of foreign currency devaluations on Duke Energy s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  . 
  Summary of Sensitivity Analysis for Foreign Currency Risks   

  (a)    Amounts represent the potential annual net pretax loss on the translation of local currency earnings to the U.S. dollar in 
  2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
           (b) 
    Amounts represent the potential impact to the currency translation through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
       OTHER MATTERS 
  Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  ratios of earnings to fixed charges, as calculated using SEC guidelines, are included in the table below.   

           (a) 
    Includes the results of Progress Energy beginning on July 2, 2012. 
     Midwest Generation Exit 
  Merchant power plants have, in the recent past, delivered volatile returns in the competitive energy markets in the Midwest. In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) had granted revenue support from regulated retail markets to help stabilize returns during the transition to competitive markets. However, in early 2014, a request for continued revenue support was denied by the PUCO. This decision made it clear the energy markets in Ohio were to be fully unregulated. Although the undiscounted cash flows recover the carrying value of the Midwest Generation assets, the recovery period is over a long period of time, with risks inherent in operating these assets in competitive energy markets and in an ever changing landscape of environmental regulations related to fossil fuel based generation sources. Management concluded in early 2014 that the projected risk and earnings profile of these assets was no longer consistent with Duke Energy s strategy and initiated a plan to sell these assets and realize the fair value over a shorter period while reducing the risk and volatility associated with these assets. 
  On August 21, 2014, Duke Energy Commercial Enterprises, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation, and Duke Energy SAM, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, entered into a PSA with a subsidiary of Dynegy whereby Dynegy will acquire Duke Energy s Disposal Group for approximately $2.8 billion in cash subject to adjustments at closing for changes in working capital and capital expenditures. The completion of the transaction is conditioned on approval by FERC and the release of certain credit support obligations. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2015. For additional information on the Midwest generation business disposition see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions, Dispositions and Sales of Other Assets."

PART II 

   North Carolina Ash Basins 
  On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas  retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river during the incident. For additional information see Note   5   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies."  
  Environmental Regulations 
  Duke Energy is subject to international, federal, state, and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, and other environmental matters. The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to federal, state, and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  The following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance, and other costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements as a result of these proposed and final regulations. The actual compliance costs may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final EPA regulations. Refer to Note   4   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 
  On September 20, 2014, the Coal Ash Act became law. The Coal Ash Act (i) establishes a Coal Ash Management Commission (Coal Ash Commission) to oversee handling of coal ash within the state; (ii) prohibits construction of new and expansion of existing ash impoundments and use of existing impoundments at retired facilities, effective October 1, 2014; (iii) requires closure of ash impoundments at Duke Energy Progress' Asheville and Sutton stations and Duke Energy Carolinas' Riverbend and Dan River stations no later than August 1, 2019; (iv) requires dry disposal of fly ash at active plants not retired by December 31, 2018; (v) requires dry disposal of bottom ash at active plants by December 31, 2019, or retirement of active plants; (vi) requires all remaining ash impoundments in North Carolina to be categorized as high-risk, intermediate-risk, or low-risk no later than December 31, 2015 by The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) with the method of closure and timing to be based upon the assigned risk, with closure no later than December 31, 2029; (vii) establishes requirements to deal with groundwater and surface water impacts from impoundments and (viii) enhances the level of regulation for structural fills utilizing coal ash. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and modification of requirements regarding structural fills and compliance boundaries. Provisions of the Coal Ash Act prohibit cost recovery for unlawful discharge of ash basin waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act included a moratorium for any NCUC ordered rate changes to effectuate the legislation, which ended January 15, 2015. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of CCR surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. In November 2014, Duke Energy submitted to DENR site specific coal ash excavation plans for the four high priority stations required to be closed no later than August 1, 2019. These plans and all associated permits must be approved by DENR before any excavation work can begin. 
  In September 2014, Duke Energy Carolinas executed a consent agreement with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) requiring the excavation of an inactive ash basin and ash fill area at the W.S. Lee Steam Station. As part of this agreement, in December 2014, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an ash removal plan and schedule with SCDHEC.  
  For further information, refer to Note   5   of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.  
  Mercury and Air Toxics Standards 
  The final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule, previously referred to as the Utility MACT Rule, was issued on February 16, 2012. The final rule establishes emission limits for hazardous air pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. The rule requires sources to comply with emission limits by April 16, 2015. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), permitting authorities have the discretion to grant up to a one-year compliance extension, on a case-by-case basis, to sources that are unable to complete the installation of emission controls before the compliance deadline. The Duke Energy Registrants have requested and received a number of compliance extensions. Strategies to achieve compliance with the final rule will include installation of new air emission control equipment, development of monitoring processes, fuel switching, and acceleration of retirement for some coal-fired electric-generation units. For additional information, refer to Note   4   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," regarding potential plant retirements. 
  In April 2014, several petitions for review of the final rule were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court). On November 25, 2014, the Supreme Court granted a petition for review based on the issue of whether the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants from coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 25, 2015. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of the Supreme Court review of the D.C. Circuit Court decision and are planning for the rule to be implemented as promulgated given the imminent compliance deadline.  
  Clean Water Act 316(b) 
  The EPA published the final 316(b) cooling water intake structure rule on August 15, 2014, with an effective date of October 14, 2014. The rule applies to 27 of the electric generating facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own and operate depending on unit retirement dates, excluding stations included in the Disposal Group. The rule allows several options for demonstrating compliance and provides flexibility to the state environmental permitting agencies to make determinations on controls, if any, that will be required for cooling water intake structures. Any required intake structure modifications and/or retrofits are expected to be installed in the 2019 to 2022 timeframe. Petitions challenging the rule have been filed by several groups. It is unknown at this time when the courts will rule on the petitions. 
    71 

PART II 

   Steam Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines 
  On June 7, 2013, the EPA proposed Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines. The EPA is under a revised court order to finalize the rule by September 30, 2015. The EPA has proposed eight options for the rule, which vary in stringency and cost. The proposed regulation applies to seven waste streams, including wastewater from air pollution control equipment and ash transport water. Most, if not all, of the steam electric generating facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own are likely affected sources. Requirements to comply with the final rule may begin as early as late 2018 for some facilities.  
  Estimated Cost and Impacts of Rulemakings 
  The ultimate compliance requirements for currently proposed environmental regulations will not be known until all the rules have been finalized. The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance, and other expenses, in addition to costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements as a result of these regulations. The actual compliance costs incurred may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final regulations. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek rate recovery of appropriate amounts incurred associated with regulated operations in complying with these regulations. Refer to Note   4   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters," for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.  
  The following table provides estimated costs, excluding AFUDC, of new control equipment that may need to be installed on existing power plants, including conversion of plants to dry disposal of bottom ash and fly ash, to comply with the above regulations over the five years ended December 31, 2019. The table excludes amounts related to the Disposal Group and ash basin closure costs recorded as asset retirement obligations, for additional information refer to Note   9   of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations." The table also does not include estimated ash basin closure costs to comply with the recently issued EPA regulations for the disposal of CCR from power plants.   

  Coal Combustion Residuals  
  On December 19, 2014, the EPA signed the first federal regulation for the disposal of CCR from power plants. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments, structural fills and CCR piles. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the requirements of the federal CCR regulation, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be independently regulated by most states. Duke Energy records an asset retirement obligation when it has a legal obligation to incur retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Once the rule is effective in 2015, additional asset retirement obligation amounts will be recorded at all Duke registrants. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with state utility commissions, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations. At this time, Duke Energy is evaluating the CCR regulation and developing cost estimates that will largely be dependent upon compliance alternatives selected to meet requirements of the regulations. For more information, see Note   5   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies." 
  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 
  On August 8, 2011, the final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) was published in the Federal Register. The CSAPR established state-level annual sulfur dioxide (SO   2)    budgets and annual and seasonal nitrogen oxide (NO   x   ) budgets that were to take effect on January 1, 2012. 
  On August 21, 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court vacated the CSAPR. The court also directed the EPA to continue administering the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which required additional reductions in SO   2    and NO   x    emissions beginning in 2015. On April 29, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court (Supreme Court) reversed the D.C. Circuit Court s decision, finding that with CSAPR the EPA reasonably interpreted the good neighbor provision of the CAA. The case was remanded to the D.C. Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court s opinion. On October 23, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court lifted the CSAPR stay, which allowed Phase 1 of the rule to take effect on January 1, 2015, terminating the CAIR. Where the CSAPR requirements are constraining, actions to meet the requirements could include purchasing emission allowances, power purchases, curtailing generation and utilizing low sulfur fuel. The CSAPR will not result in Duke Energy Registrants adding new emission controls. 
  Additional challenges to the CSAPR filed in 2012, not addressed by the D.C. Circuit Court decision to vacate the CSAPR, are still ongoing. Oral arguments were held February 25, 2015. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or how the requirements of the CSAPR may be impacted going forward.  
  Carbon Dioxide New Source Performance Standards 
  On January 8, 2014, the EPA proposed a rule to establish carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) emissions standards for new pulverized coal, IGCC, natural gas combined cycle, and simple cycle electric generating units commencing construction on or after that date. Based on the proposal, future coal and IGCC units will be required to employ carbon capture and storage technology to meet the proposed standard. 
    72 

PART II 

   In January 2015, the EPA announced that it would finalize the rule for new power plants in the summer of 2015. The Duke Energy Registrants do not expect a material impact on their future results of operations or cash flows based on the EPA s proposal. The final rule, however, could be significantly different from the proposal. 
  CO   2    Existing Source Performance Standards and Standards for Reconstructed and Modified Units 
  On June 18, 2014, the EPA s proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP) for regulating CO   2    emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs) was published in the Federal Register. On the same date the EPA proposed carbon pollution standards for reconstructed and modified EGUs. The comment period ended October 16, 2014 for the reconstructed and modified proposal and December 1, 2014 for the CPP. Duke Energy submitted comments on both proposals. In January 2015 the EPA announced that it would finalize both proposals in the summer of 2015.  
  Once the CPP is finalized, states will be required to develop plans to implement its requirements. The CPP will not directly impose any regulatory requirements on Duke Energy Registrants. State implementation plans will include the regulatory requirements that will apply to Duke Energy Registrants. Based on the EPA s June 18, 2014 proposal, states will have from one to three years after the CPP is finalized to submit a plan for EPA s review. In January 2015 the EPA announced that it would also propose a federal implementation plan for public comment in the summer of 2015. A federal plan would be EPA s plan for meeting the requirements of the CPP and could take the place of a state plan if a state either fails to submit a plan or submits a plan that is not approved by the EPA. 
  The EPA has proposed to phase CO   2    emission reductions in over the period 2020 to 2030. The final requirements of the CPP, however, including the implementation schedule are uncertain and could be significantly different from the proposal. In addition, it will be several years before the requirements of the subsequent state plans are known. Also unknown at this time are the requirements of any federal plan that might be imposed on states in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate should a state fail to submit a plan or have their plan disapproved by the EPA. The Duke Energy Registrants are therefore unable to predict the outcome of this rulemaking, or how it might impact them, but the impact could be significant. 
  Global Climate Change 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions consist primarily of CO   2    with most coming from their fleet of coal-fired power plants in the U.S. In 2014, the Duke Energy Registrants  U.S. power plants emitted approximately 135 million tons of CO   2   . CO   2    emissions from Duke Energy s international operations were approximately 2 million tons. The Duke Energy Registrants  future CO   2    emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, and the Duke Energy Registrants  decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are taking actions that will result in reduced GHG emissions over time. These actions will lower the Duke Energy Registrants  exposure to any future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether a result of federal legislation or EPA regulation. Under any future scenario involving mandatory GHG limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of compliance costs associated with their regulated operations through appropriate regulatory mechanisms. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with climate change, and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes of extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place, and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants  impossible. Currently, the Duke Energy Registrants plan and prepare for extreme weather events they experience from time to time, such as ice storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, high winds and droughts. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems. The Duke Energy Registrants  electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity. The Duke Energy Registrants have a program in place to effectively manage the impact of future droughts on their operations. 
  Nuclear Matters 
  Following the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan, Duke Energy conducted thorough inspections at each of its seven nuclear sites during 2011. The initial inspections did not identify any significant vulnerabilities, however, Duke Energy is reviewing designs to evaluate safety margins to external events. Emergency-response capabilities, written procedures and engineering specifications were reviewed to verify each site s ability to respond in the unlikely event of station blackout. Duke Energy is working within the nuclear industry to improve safety standards and margin using the three layers of safety approach used in the U.S.: protection, mitigation and emergency response. Emergency equipment is currently being added at each station to perform key safety functions in the event that backup power sources are lost permanently. These improvements are in addition to the numerous layers of safety measures and systems previously in place. 
  In March 2011, the NRC formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system. On July 13, 2011, the task force proposed a set of improvements designed to ensure protection, enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of NRC programs. The recommendations were further prioritized into three tiers based on the safety enhancement level. On March 12, 2012, the NRC issued three regulatory orders requiring safety enhancements related to mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at a plant, ensuring reliable hardened containment vents and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation. 
  On August 30, 2012, the NRC issued implementation guidance to enable power plants to achieve compliance with the orders issued in March 2012. Plants were required to submit implementation plans to the NRC by February 28, 2013, and complete implementation of the safety enhancements within two refueling outages or by December 31, 2016, whichever comes first. Each plant is also required to reassess their seismic and flooding hazards using present-day methods and information, conduct inspections to ensure protection against hazards in the current design basis, and re-evaluate emergency communications systems and staffing levels. 
    73 

PART II 

   Duke Energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancements ordered by the NRC in connection with the March 12, 2012, regulatory orders noted above, the cost of which could be material. Until such time as the NRC-mandated reassessment of flooding and seismic hazards is complete the exact scope and cost of compliance modifications to Duke Energy s sites will not be known. With the NRC s continuing review of the remaining recommendations, Duke Energy cannot predict to what extent the NRC will impose additional licensing and safety-related requirements, or the costs of complying with such requirements. Upon receipt of additional guidance from the NRC and a collaborative industry review, Duke Energy will be able to determine an implementation plan and associated costs. See Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  for further discussion of applicable risk factors.

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
  Duke Energy Corporation 
  Charlotte, North Carolina 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission  . The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying   Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  
  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission  .

  Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Duke Energy operates in the United States (U.S.) and Latin America primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

(Duke Energy Progress); Duke Energy Florida, Inc. (Duke Energy Florida); Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio) and Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (Duke Energy Indiana). When discussing Duke Energy s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its six separate subsidiary registrants (collectively referred to as the Subsidiary Registrants), which, along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants (Duke Energy Registrants). 
  On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy merged with Progress Energy, with Duke Energy continuing as the surviving corporation. Progress Energy became a subsidiary of Duke Energy and Progress Energy s regulated utility subsidiaries, Duke Energy Progress (formerly Carolina Power   Light Company d/b/a Progress Energy Carolinas, Inc.) and Duke Energy Florida (formerly Florida Power Corporation d/b/a Progress Energy Florida, Inc.), became indirect subsidiaries of Duke Energy. Duke Energy s consolidated financial statements include Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida activity beginning July 2, 2012. The impacts of acquisition accounting from Progress Energy s merger with Duke Energy were recorded by Duke Energy and were not reflected on the financial statements of Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. See Note 2 for additional information regarding the merger. On July 2, 2012, just prior to the close of the merger, Duke Energy executed a one-for-three reverse stock split with respect to the issued and outstanding shares of Duke Energy common stock. All per-share amounts included in this Form 10-K are presented as if the stock split had been effective from the beginning of the earliest period presented.

  These Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of the Duke Energy Registrants and subsidiaries where the respective Duke Energy Registrants have control. These Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Duke Energy Registrants  proportionate share of certain jointly owned generation and transmission facilities.

  Discontinued Operations 
  For the year ended   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy s Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax was primarily related to a write-down of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated fair value of the Disposal Group, based on the transaction price included in the PSA, and the operations of the Disposal Group.

See Note   2   for additional information. 
  For the years ended   December 31, 2014  , 2013 and 2012. Progress Energy s (Loss) Income From Discontinued Operations, net of tax was primarily due to tax impacts related to prior sales of diversified businesses.  
  Amounts Attributable to Controlling Interests 
  The following table presents Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation for continuing operations and discontinued operations.   

  Significant Accounting Policies 
  Use of Estimates 
  In preparing financial statements that conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S., the Duke Energy Registrants must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Regulatory Accounting 
  The majority of the Duke Energy Registrants  operations are subject to price regulation for the sale of electricity and gas by state utility commissions or FERC. When prices are set on the basis of specific costs of the regulated operations and an effective franchise is in place such that sufficient gas or electric services can be sold to recover those costs, the Duke Energy Registrants apply regulatory accounting. Regulatory accounting changes the timing of the recognition of costs or revenues relative to a company that does not apply regulatory accounting. As a result, Regulatory assets and Regulatory liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related cost in the ratemaking process. See Note   4   for further information. 
  Regulated Fuel Costs and Purchased Power 
  The Duke Energy Registrants utilize cost-tracking mechanisms, commonly referred to as fuel adjustment clauses. These clauses allow for the recovery of fuel and fuel-related costs and portions of purchased power costs through surcharges on customer rates. The difference between the costs incurred and the surcharge revenues is recorded as an adjustment to Fuel Operating Revenues   Regulated electric on the Consolidated Statements of Operations with an off-setting impact on regulatory assets or liabilities.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. At   December 31, 2014  ,   $1,680 million   of Duke Energy s total cash and cash equivalents is held by entities domiciled in foreign jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Duke Energy declared a taxable dividend of historical foreign earnings in the form of notes payable that will result in the repatriation of approximately   $2.7 billion   in cash held and expected to be generated by International Energy over a period of up to   8 years  . See Note   22   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Income Taxes,  for additional information. 
  Restricted Cash 
  The Duke Energy Registrants have restricted cash related primarily to collateral assets, escrow deposits and variable interest entities (VIEs). Restricted cash balances are reflected in Other within Current Assets and in Other within Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , Duke Energy had restricted cash totaling   $298 million   and   $307 million  , respectively. 
  Inventory 
  Inventory is used for operations and is recorded primarily using the average cost method. Inventory related to regulated operations is valued at historical cost. Inventory related to nonregulated operations is valued at the lower of cost or market. Materials and supplies are recorded as inventory when purchased and subsequently charged to expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment when installed. Reserves are established for excess and obsolete inventory. The components of inventory are presented in the tables below.   

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities 
  The Duke Energy Registrants classify investments into two categories   trading and available-for-sale. Both categories are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. For certain investments of regulated operations such as the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund (NDTF), realized and unrealized gains and losses (including any other-than-temporary impairments) on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. Otherwise, unrealized gains and losses are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), unless other-than-temporarily impaired. Other-than-temporary impairments for equity securities and the credit loss portion of debt securities of nonregulated operations are included in earnings. Investments in debt and equity securities are classified as either current or noncurrent based on management s intent and ability to sell these securities, taking into consideration current market liquidity. See Note   15   for further information. 
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill 
  Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Ohio perform annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31 each year at the reporting unit level, which is determined to be an operating segment or one level below. Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Ohio update these tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
  In 2012, Progress Energy changed its goodwill impairment testing date from October 31 to August 31 to better align its annual goodwill impairment testing procedure with those of Duke Energy. The change had no impact on goodwill. Neither the change in the goodwill impairment testing date nor the merger resulted in any changes to the Progress Energy reporting units.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   Intangible Assets 
  Intangible assets are included in Other in Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, intangible assets are amortized using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed, or on a straight-line basis if that pattern is not readily determinable. Amortization of intangibles is reflected in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and if impaired, the carrying value is accordingly reduced. 
  Emission allowances permit the holder of the allowance to emit certain gaseous byproducts of fossil fuel combustion, including sulfur dioxide (SO   2   ) and nitrogen oxide (NO   X   ). Allowances are issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at zero cost and may also be bought and sold via third-party transactions. Allowances allocated to or acquired by the Duke Energy Registrants are held primarily for consumption. Carrying amounts for emission allowances are based on the cost to acquire the allowances or, in the case of a business combination, on the fair value assigned in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired business. 
  Renewable energy certificates are used to measure compliance with renewable energy standards and are held primarily for consumption. See Note   11   for further information. 
  Long-Lived Asset Impairments 
  The Duke Energy Registrants evaluate long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when a long-lived asset s carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The estimated cash flows may be based on alternative expected outcomes that are probability weighted. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on these estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is written-down to its then-current estimated fair value and an impairment charge is recognized. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants assess fair value of long-lived assets using various methods, including recent comparable third-party sales, internally developed discounted cash flow analysis and analysis from outside advisors. Significant changes in commodity prices, the condition of an asset or management s interest in selling the asset are generally viewed as triggering events to re-assess cash flows. See Note   11   for further information. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of depreciated historical cost net of any disallowances or fair value, if impaired. The Duke Energy Registrants capitalize all construction-related direct labor and material costs, as well as indirect construction costs such as general engineering, taxes and financing costs. See  Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized  for information on capitalized financing costs. Costs of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are also capitalized. The cost of repairs, replacements and major maintenance projects, which do not extend the useful life or increase the expected output of the asset, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is generally computed over the estimated useful life of the asset using the composite straight-line method. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update composite rates and are approved by state utility commissions and/or the FERC when required. The composite weighted-average depreciation rates, excluding nuclear fuel, are included in the table that follows.   

  In general, when the Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, plant and equipment, original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable a regulated asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the net amount is classified as Generation facilities to be retired, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset is no longer operating, the net amount is classified in Regulatory Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are allowed to recover the remaining net book value and a return equal to at least the incremental borrowing rate. If not, an impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate. 
  When the Duke Energy Registrants sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed from Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body. 
  See Note   10   for further information.

   Nuclear Fuel 
  Nuclear fuel is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, except for Duke Energy Florida. Duke Energy Florida has reclassified all Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Station (Crystal River Unit 3) investments, including nuclear fuel, to a regulatory asset. Refer to Note 4,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information on Crystal River Unit 3.  
  Nuclear fuel in the front-end fuel processing phase is considered work in progress and not amortized until placed in service. Amortization of nuclear fuel is included within Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power - regulated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization is recorded using the units-of-production method.  
  Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized 
  For regulated operations, the debt and equity costs of financing the construction of property, plant and equipment are reflected as AFUDC and capitalized as a component of the cost of property, plant and equipment. AFUDC equity is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as non-cash income in Other income and expenses, net. AFUDC debt is reported as a non-cash offset to Interest Expense. After construction is completed, the Duke Energy Registrants are permitted to recover these costs through their inclusion in rate base and the corresponding subsequent depreciation or amortization of those regulated assets. 
  AFUDC equity, a permanent difference for income taxes, reduces the effective tax rate when capitalized and increases the effective tax rate when depreciated or amortized. See Note   22   for additional information. 
  For nonregulated operations, interest is capitalized during the construction phase with an offsetting non-cash credit to Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Asset Retirement Obligations 
  Asset retirement obligations are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Substantially all asset retirement obligations are related to regulated operations. When recording an asset retirement obligation, the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. For operating plants, the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. For retired plants, the present value of the liability is recorded as a regulatory asset and expensed over the recovery period in rates.  
  The present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the asset retirement obligation for regulated operations through a combination of regulated revenues and NDTF. As a result, the net of amounts recovered in regulated revenues, earnings on the NDTF, accretion expense and depreciation of the associated asset is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. 
  Obligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. Duke Energy Florida assumes Crystal River Unit 3 will be placed into a safe storage configuration until eventual dismantlement begins in approximately   60 years  . Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on site until such time that it can be transferred to a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility. 
  Obligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs based upon probability weightings of the potential closure methods as evaluated on a site by site basis. Duke Energy Registrants with ash basins in North Carolina and certain basins in South Carolina and Indiana have a legal obligation that results in recognition of an asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2014. See Notes 5 and   9   for further information. 
  Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenue 
  Revenues on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when service is provided or the product is delivered. Unbilled revenues are recognized by applying customer billing rates to the estimated volumes of energy delivered but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer mix, average price in effect for customer classes and meter reading schedules.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   Unbilled revenues are included within Receivables and Restricted receivables of variable interest entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as shown in the following table. This table excludes amounts included in assets held for sale (AHFS).   

  Additionally, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell, on a revolving basis, nearly all of their retail accounts receivable, including receivables for unbilled revenues, to an affiliate, Cinergy Receivables Company, LLC (CRC) and account for the transfers of receivables as sales. Accordingly, the receivables sold are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note   17   for further information. These receivables for unbilled revenues are shown in the table below.   

  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  Allowances for doubtful accounts are presented in the following table.   

  Derivatives and Hedging 
  Derivative and non-derivative instruments may be used in connection with commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, including swaps, futures, forwards and options. All derivative instruments except those that qualify for the normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS) exception are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Qualifying derivative instruments may be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Other derivative instruments (undesignated contracts) either have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a fair value hedge is offset in net income by changes in the hedged item. For activity subject to regulatory accounting, gains and losses on derivative contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities and not as other comprehensive income or current period income. As a result, changes in fair value of these derivatives have no immediate earnings impact. 
  Formal documentation, including transaction type and risk management strategy, is maintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and at least every three months thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if it is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. 
  See Note   14   for further information.

   Captive Insurance Reserves 
  Duke Energy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on an indemnity basis, to the Subsidiary Registrants as well as certain third parties, on a limited basis, for various business risks and losses, such as property, workers  compensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR), as well as estimated provisions for known claims. IBNR reserve estimates are primarily based upon historical loss experience, industry data and other actuarial assumptions. Reserve estimates are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from experience. 
  Duke Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization is deemed probable. 
  Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount and Expense 
  Premiums, discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt are amortized over the term of the debt issue. Call premiums and unamortized expenses associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations in the regulated operations are amortized. Amortization expense is recorded as Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and is reflected as Depreciation, amortization and accretion within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Loss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities 
  Contingent losses are recorded when it is probable a loss has occurred and can be reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred. 
  Environmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental remediation or other liabilities becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental expenditures related to past operations that do not generate current or future revenues are expensed. Environmental expenditures related to operations that generate current or future revenues are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Certain environmental expenditures receive regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded as regulatory assets. 
  See Notes   4   and   5   for further information. 
  Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 
  Duke Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in the respective qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans and the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of benefit costs. See Note   21   for further information, including significant accounting policies associated with these plans. 
  Severance and Special Termination Benefits 
  Duke Energy has an ongoing severance plan under which, in general, the longer a terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of severance benefits. A liability for involuntary severance is recorded once an involuntary severance plan is committed to by management, or sooner, if involuntary severances are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For involuntary severance benefits incremental to its ongoing severance plan benefits, the fair value of the obligation is expensed at the communication date if there are no future service requirements, or over the required future service period. From time to time, Duke Energy offers special termination benefits under voluntary severance programs. Special termination benefits are recorded immediately upon employee acceptance absent a significant retention period. Otherwise, the cost is recorded over the remaining service period. Employee acceptance of voluntary severance benefits is determined by management based on the facts and circumstances of the benefits being offered. See Note   19   for further information. 
  Guarantees 
  Liabilities are recognized at the time of issuance or material modification of a guarantee for the estimated fair value of the obligation it assumes. Fair value is estimated using a probability-weighted approach. The obligation is reduced over the term of the guarantee or related contract in a systematic and rational method as risk is reduced. Any additional contingent loss for guarantee contracts subsequent to the initial recognition of a liability is accounted for and recognized at the time a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Note   7   for further information. 
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  Stock-based compensation represents costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees and Duke Energy Board of Directors (Board of Directors) members. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures at the date of issuance. The recognition period for these costs begin at either the applicable service inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite service period, or for certain share-based awards until the employee becomes retirement eligible, if earlier. Compensation cost is recognized as expense or capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. See Note   20   for further information. 
  Income Taxes 
  Duke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and foreign jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants entered into a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. Deferred taxes are not provided on translation gains and losses when earnings of a foreign operation are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Investment tax credits (ITC) associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties.

   Positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns, including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return, are recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position can be sustained based solely on the technical merits of the position. The largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being effectively settled is recorded. Management considers a tax position effectively settled when: (i) the taxing authority has completed its examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; (ii) the Duke Energy Registrants do not intend to appeal or litigate the tax position included in the completed examination; and (iii) it is remote the taxing authority would examine or re-examine the tax position. The amount of a tax return position that is not recognized in the financial statements is disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. If these unrecognized tax benefits are later recognized, then there will be a decrease in income taxes payable, an income tax refund or a swap between deferred and current taxes payable. If the portion of tax benefits that has been recognized changes and those tax benefits are subsequently unrecognized, then the previously recognized tax benefits may impact the financial statements through increasing income taxes payable, reducing income tax refunds receivable changing deferred taxes. Changes in assumptions on tax benefits may also impact interest expense or interest income and may result in the recognition of tax penalties. 
  Tax-related interest and penalties are recorded in Interest Expense and Other Income and Expenses, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  See Note   22   for further information. 
  Accounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits and Cash Grants 
  When Duke Energy receives ITC or cash grants on wind or solar facilities, it reduces the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the amount of the ITC or cash grant and, therefore, the ITC or grant benefit is recognized through reduced depreciation expense. Additionally, certain tax credits and government grants received provide for initial tax depreciable base in excess of the book carrying value equal to one half of the ITC or government grant. Deferred tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period that the basis difference is created. 
  Excise Taxes 
  Certain excise taxes levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis. Otherwise, the taxes are accounted for net. Excise taxes accounted for on a gross basis as both operating revenues and property and other taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows.   

  During the third quarter of 2014, the North Carolina gross receipts tax was terminated due to the North Carolina Tax Simplification and Rate Reduction Act. The North Carolina gross receipts tax is no longer imposed effective July 1, 2014. 
    
  On July 23, 2013, North Carolina House Bill 998 (HB 998) was signed into law. HB 998 repealed the utility franchise tax effective July 1, 2014. The utility franchise tax was   3.22 percent   gross receipts tax on sales of electricity. The result of this change in law will be an annual reduction in excise taxes of approximately   $160 million   for Duke Energy Carolinas and approximately   $110 million   for Duke Energy Progress. HB 998 also increases sales tax on electricity from   3 percent   to   7 percent   effective July 1, 2014. HB 998 requires the NCUC to adjust retail electric rates for the elimination of the utility franchise tax, changes due to the increase in sales tax on electricity, and the resulting change in liability of utility companies under the general franchise tax. 
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  The local currencies of most of Duke Energy s foreign operations have been determined to be their functional currencies. However, certain foreign operations  functional currency has been determined to be the U.S. dollar, based on an assessment of the economic circumstances of the foreign operation  .   Assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. Translation adjustments resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in AOCI. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from balances and transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the results of operations when they occur. 
  Dividend Restrictions and Unappropriated Retained Earnings 
  Duke Energy does not have any legal, regulatory or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders. However, as further described in Note   4  , due to conditions established by regulators in conjunction with merger transaction approvals, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana have restrictions on paying dividends or otherwise advancing funds to Duke Energy. At   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , an insignificant amount of Duke Energy s consolidated Retained earnings balance represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments.

   New Accounting Standards 
  The new accounting standards that were adopted for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   had no significant impact on the presentation or results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Duke Energy Registrants. Disclosures have been enhanced to provide a discussion and tables on derivative contracts subject to enforceable master netting agreements and a table of quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs. See Notes   14   and   16   for further information. 
  The following new Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) have been issued, but have not yet been adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants, as of   December 31, 2014  . 
  ASC 205   Reporting Discontinued Operations  . In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued revised accounting guidance for reporting discontinued operations. A discontinued operation would be either (i) a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity that represents a separate major line of business or major geographical area of operations that either has been disposed of or is part of a single coordinated plan to be classified as held for sale or (ii) a business that, on acquisition, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. 
  For the Duke Energy Registrants, this guidance is effective on a prospective basis for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2015. This guidance will also result in increased disclosures for discontinued operations or disposals of individually significant components that are not classified as discontinued operations. In general, this guidance is likely to result in fewer disposals of assets qualifying as discontinued operations. 
  ASC 606   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . In May 2014, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 
  For the Duke Energy Registrants, this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2017. Duke Energy is currently evaluating the requirements. The ultimate impact of the new standard has not yet been determined. 
    2. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND SALES OF OTHER ASSETS  
  ACQUISITIONS 
  The Duke Energy Registrants consolidate assets and liabilities from acquisitions as of the purchase date, and include earnings from acquisitions in consolidated earnings after the purchase date. 
  Purchase of NCEMPA's Generation 
  On September 5, 2014, Duke Energy Progress executed an agreement to purchase North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency s (NCEMPA) ownership interests in certain generating assets jointly owned with and operated by Duke Energy Progress. The agreement provides for the acquisition of a total of approximately 700 megawatts (MW) at Brunswick Nuclear Station (Brunswick), Shearon Harris Nuclear Station (Harris), Mayo Steam Station and Roxboro Steam Station. The purchase price for the ownership interest and fuel and spare parts inventory is approximately   $1.2 billion  . Under the agreement, Duke Energy Progress and NCEMPA will enter into a 30-year wholesale power supply agreement to continue meeting the needs of NCEMPA s customers. Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including state and federal regulatory approvals and legislative action required prior to completing the transaction. On December 9, 2014, the FERC approved Duke Energy Progress' request to purchase NCEMPA's interests in the generation assets, approved Duke Energy Progress' 30-year wholesale power supply agreement with NCEMPA, and approved Duke Energy Progress' inclusion of the acquisition adjustment resulting from the asset purchase in wholesale power formula rates. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2015 or early 2016. 
  Merger with Progress Energy 
  On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy completed its merger with Progress Energy, a North Carolina corporation engaged in the regulated utility business of generation, transmission and distribution and sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. As a result of the merger, Progress Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy.  
  The merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy provides increased scale and diversity with potentially enhanced access to capital over the long term and a greater ability to undertake the significant construction programs necessary to respond to increasing environmental regulation, plant retirements and customer demand growth. Duke Energy s business risk profile is expected to improve over time due to the increased proportion of the business that is regulated. Additionally, cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits are expected from the combined operations.

   Purchase Price    
  Total consideration transferred was based on the closing price of Duke Energy common shares on July 2, 2012, and was calculated as shown in the following table.   

  Progress Energy s stock-based compensation awards, including performance shares and restricted stock, were replaced with Duke Energy awards upon consummation of the merger. In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, a portion of the fair value of these awards is included in the purchase price as it represents consideration transferred in the merger. 
  Purchase Price Allocation 
  Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 inputs, which are judgmental in nature. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows, and future market prices. 
  Additionally, the February 5, 2013 announcement of the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3 reflected additional information related to facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. See Note   4   for additional information related to Crystal River Unit 3. As such, Duke Energy presents assets acquired and liabilities assumed as if the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3 occurred on the acquisition date. 
  The majority of Progress Energy s operations are subject to the rate-setting authority of the FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, and FPSC and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. GAAP, including the accounting guidance for regulated operations. Rate-setting and cost recovery provisions currently in place for Progress Energy s regulated operations provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base. Except for long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, capital leases, pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations (OPEB), and the wholesale portion of Crystal River Unit 3, fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximate their carrying values. Accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pro forma financial information do not reflect any net adjustments related to these amounts. The difference between fair value and pre-merger carrying amounts for long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, capital leases and pension and OPEB plans for regulated operations were recorded as Regulatory assets. 
  The excess of purchase price over estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill at the acquisition date. The goodwill reflects the value paid primarily for long-term potential for enhanced access to capital as a result of increased scale and diversity, opportunities for synergies, and an improved risk profile. Goodwill resulting from the merger was allocated entirely to the Regulated Utilities segment. None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes, and as such, no deferred taxes have been recorded related to goodwill. 
  The completed purchase price allocation is presented in the following table.   

  The purchase price allocation in the table above reflects refinements made to preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2012. These refinements include adjustments associated with the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3. The changes resulted in an increase to Goodwill of   $2 million  , an increase to the fair value of Current liabilities, including current maturities of long-term debt of   $12 million  , a decrease to Property, plant and equipment of   $138 million  , a decrease to Other long-term assets of   $4 million   and a decrease to Long-term liabilities, preferred stock and noncontrolling interests of   $152 million  . These refinements had no impact on the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments recorded to earnings during the year ended December 31, 2013, or for the six months ended December 31, 2012.

   Pro Forma Financial Information 
  The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Duke Energy and the amortization of purchase price adjustments assuming the merger had taken place on January 1, 2012. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have been achieved or future consolidated results of operations of Duke Energy. 
  Non-recurring merger consummation, integration and other costs incurred by Duke Energy and Progress Energy during the period have been excluded from pro forma earnings presented below. After-tax non-recurring merger consummation, integration and other costs incurred by both Duke Energy and Progress Energy were   $413 million   for the year ended 2012. The pro forma financial information also excludes potential future cost savings or non-recurring charges related to the merger.   

  Accounting Charges Related to the Merger Consummation 
  The following pretax consummation charges were recognized upon closing of the merger and are included in the Duke Energy Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2012.   

  FERC Mitigation charges reflect the portion of transmission project costs probable of disallowance, impairment of the carrying value of the generation assets serving Interim FERC Mitigation, and mark-to-market losses recognized on power sale agreements upon closing of the merger. Charges related to transmission projects and impairment of the carrying value of generation assets were recorded within Impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Mark-to-market losses on interim power sale agreements was recorded in Regulated electric operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Subsequent changes in fair value of interim power sale agreements over the life of the contracts and realized gains or losses on interim contract sales are also recorded within Regulated electric operating revenues. The ability to successfully defend future recovery of a portion of transmission projects in rates and any future changes to estimated transmission project costs could impact the amount not expected to be recovered. 
  In conjunction with the merger, in November 2011, Duke Energy and Progress Energy each offered a voluntary severance plan (VSP) to certain eligible employees. VSP and other severance costs incurred were recorded primarily within Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note   19   for further information related to employee severance expenses. 
  Community support, charitable contributions and other reflect (i) the unconditional obligation to provide funding at a level comparable to historic practices over the next four years, and (ii) financial and legal advisory costs incurred upon the closing of the merger, retention and relocation costs paid to certain employees. These charges were recorded within Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Impact of Merger 
  The impact of Progress Energy on Duke Energy s revenues and net income attributable to Duke Energy in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 was an increase of   $4,943 million   and   $368 million  , respectively. 
  Chilean Operations 
  In December 2012, Duke Energy acquired Iberoamericana de Energ a Ibener, S.A. (Ibener) of Santiago, Chile, for cash consideration of   $415 million  . This acquisition included the 140 MW Duqueco hydroelectric generation complex consisting of two run-of-the-river plants located in southern Chile. Purchase price allocation consisted primarily of   $383 million   of property, plant and equipment,   $30 million   of intangible assets,   $57 million   of deferred income tax liabilities,   $54 million   of goodwill and   $8 million   of working capital.

   DISPOSITIONS 
  Midwest Generation Exit 
  On August 21, 2014, Duke Energy Commercial Enterprises, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation, and Duke Energy SAM, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, entered into a PSA with a subsidiary of Dynegy whereby Dynegy will acquire Duke Energy s Disposal Group for approximately   $2.8 billion   in cash subject to adjustments at closing for changes in working capital and capital expenditures. The completion of the transaction is conditioned on approval by FERC. On January 16, 2015, FERC issued a letter requesting additional information in connection with the transaction application. The request was for further economic analysis relating to the combined market power impacts of the proposed transaction and Dynegy's simultaneous acquisition of other assets in the PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) market, and information relating to rate protections for Dynegy's customers. On February 6, 2015, Duke Energy and Dynegy made two filings with FERC. The first filing provided additional information requested by FERC. The second filing provided information related to Dynegy's settlement agreement with the Independent Market Monitor for PJM, which no longer opposes the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2015. 
  The Disposal Group is included in the Commercial Power segment. The following table presents information related to the Duke Energy Ohio generation plants included in the Disposal Group.   

           (a) 
    Jointly owned with American Electric Power Generation Resources and/or The Dayton Power   Light Company. 
              (b) 
    Station is not operated by Duke Energy Ohio. 
              (c) 
    Total MW capacity is based on summer capacity. 
     The Disposal Group also includes a retail sales business owned by Duke Energy. In the second quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio removed Ohio Valley Electric Corporation's (OVEC) purchase power agreement from the Disposal Group as it no longer intended to sell it with the Disposal Group. Duke Energy Ohio has requested cost-based recovery of its contractual entitlement in OVEC in its 2014 Electric Security Plan (ESP) application filed on May 29, 2014. See Note 4 for information related to the 2014 ESP. 
  The assets and associated liabilities of the Disposal Group are classified as held for sale in Duke Energy's and Duke Energy Ohio's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2014. 
  The results of operations of the Disposal Group are classified as discontinued operations for current and prior periods in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Certain immaterial costs that that may be eliminated as a result of the sale have remained in continuing operations. The following table presents the results of discontinued operations.

            (a) 
    Other discontinued operations relate to prior sales of businesses and includes indemnifications provided for certain legal, tax and environmental matters, and foreign currency translation adjustments. 
     Duke Energy Ohio 

The Duke Energy and Duke Energy Ohio held for sale assets include net pretax impairments of approximately $929 million and $959 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The impairment was recorded to write-down the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated fair value of the business, based on the expected selling price to Dynegy less cost to sell. These losses were included in (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The impairment will be updated, if necessary, based on the final sales price, after any adjustments at closing for working capital and capital expenditures. 
  Commercial Power has a revolving credit agreement (RCA) to support the operations of the nonregulated Midwest generation business. Interest expense associated with the RCA has been allocated to discontinued operations. No other interest expense related to corporate level debt has been allocated to discontinued operations. 
  The following table presents the Disposal Group's carrying values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets' major classes of Assets held for sale.    

  Duke Energy Ohio may continue to have transactions with the Disposal Group after the divestiture is complete depending on when the transaction closes. Duke Energy Ohio has a power purchase agreement with the Disposal Group, which extends through May 2015, for a portion of its standard service offer (SSO) supply requirement. In addition, for a period of up to 12 months, Duke Energy may provide transition services to Dynegy. Duke Energy will be reimbursed for transition services provided. The continuing cash flows are not expected to be material and are not considered direct cash flows. These arrangements do not allow Duke Energy or Duke Energy Ohio to significantly influence the operations of the Disposal Group once the sale is complete. 
  See Notes   4   and   5   for a discussion of contingencies related to the Disposal Group that will be retained by Duke Energy Ohio subsequent to the sale. 
  Vermillion Generating Station 
  On January 12, 2012, after receiving approvals from the FERC and IURC on August 12, 2011 and December 28, 2011, respectively, Duke Energy Vermillion II, LLC (Duke Energy Vermillion), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, completed the sale of its ownership interest in Vermillion Generating Station (Vermillion) to Duke Energy Indiana and Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc. (WVPA). Upon closing of the sale, Duke Energy Indiana held a   62.5 percent   interest in Vermillion. Duke Energy Ohio received net proceeds of   $82 million  , of which   $68 million   was paid by Duke Energy Indiana. Following the transaction, Duke Energy Indiana retired Gallagher Units 1 and 3 effective February 1, 2012. 
  As Duke Energy Indiana is an affiliate of Duke Energy Vermillion, the transaction was accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control with no gain or loss recorded and did not have a significant impact to Duke Energy Ohio s or Duke Energy Indiana s results of operations. Proceeds received from Duke Energy Indiana are included in Net proceeds from the sales of other assets on Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash paid to Duke Energy Ohio is included in Capital expenditures on Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana recognized non-cash equity transfers of   $28 million   and   $26 million  , respectively, in their Consolidated Statements of Common Stockholder s Equity on the transaction representing the difference between cash exchanged and the net book value of Vermillion. These amounts are not reflected in Duke Energy s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or Consolidated Statements of Equity as the transaction is eliminated in consolidation.

These electric and natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, PUCO, IURC and KPSC. Substantially all of Regulated Utilities  operations are regulated and, accordingly, these operations qualify for regulatory accounting treatment. 
  International Energy principally operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in sales and marketing of electric power, natural gas and natural gas liquids outside the U.S. Its activities principally target power generation in Latin America. Additionally, International Energy owns a   25 percent   interest in National Methanol Company (NMC), a large regional producer of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) located in Saudi Arabia. The investment in NMC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
  Commercial Power builds, develops and operates renewable generation and energy transmission projects throughout the continental U.S. As discussed in Note   2  , Duke Energy entered into an agreement to sell Commercial Power's nonregulated Midwest generation business to Dynegy in a transaction that is expected to close during the second quarter of 2015. As a result of this divestiture, the results of operations of the nonregulated Midwest generation business have been reclassified to Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain costs such as interest and general and administrative expenses previously allocated to the Disposal Group were not reclassified to discontinued operations.

   2013 South Carolina Rate Case 
  On September 11, 2013, the PSCSC approved a settlement agreement related to Duke Energy Carolinas  request for a rate increase. Parties to the settlement agreement were the Office of Regulatory Staff, Wal-Mart Stores East, LP and Sam s East, Incorporated, the South Carolina Energy Users Committee, Public Works of the City of Spartanburg, South Carolina and the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce. The parties agreed to a two-year step-in rate increase, with the first year providing for approximately   $80 million  , or a   5.5 percent   average increase in rates, and the second year providing for rates to be increased by an additional   $38 million  , or   2.6 percent  . The settlement agreement is based upon a return on equity of   10.2 percent   and a   53 percent   equity component of the capital structure. The settlement agreement (i) allows for the recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than when the outage occurs, (ii) approximately   $4 million   of contributions to agencies that provide energy assistance to low-income customers and for economic development, and (iii) a reduction in the regulatory liability for costs of removal of   $45 million   for the first year. Duke Energy Carolinas has agreed not to request additional base rate increases to be effective before September 2015. New rates went into effect on   September 18, 2013  . 
  2011 North Carolina Rate Case 
  On January 27, 2012, the NCUC approved a settlement agreement related to Duke Energy Carolinas  request for a rate increase. On October 23, 2013, the NCUC issued a second order in the case reaffirming the rate of return approved in the settlement agreement, in response to an appeal by the NCAG. On November 21, 2013, the NCAG appealed the NCUC's October 2013 order. On December 19, 2014, the NCSC affirmed the NCUC's October 2013 order concluding the appeal.  
  William States Lee Combined Cycle Facility 
  On April 9, 2014, the PSCSC granted Duke Energy Carolinas and NCEMC a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity (CECPCN) for the construction and operation of a 750 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired generating plant at its existing William States Lee Generating Station in Anderson, South Carolina. On May 16, 2014, Duke Energy Carolinas announced its intention to begin construction in summer 2015 and estimated a cost to build of   $600 million   for its share of the facility, including AFUDC. The project is expected to be commercially available in late 2017. NCEMC will own approximately   13 percent   of the project. On July 3, 2014, the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League and Southern Alliance for Clean Energy jointly filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeals of South Carolina seeking the court's review of the PSCSC's decision. Duke Energy Carolinas' initial brief in support of the PSCSC's order granting the CECPCN was filed on January 12, 2015. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  William States Lee III Nuclear Station 
  In December 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas applied to the NRC for a COL for two Westinghouse AP1000 (advanced passive) reactors for the proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station (Lee Nuclear Station) at a site in Cherokee County, South Carolina. Submitting the COL application did not commit Duke Energy Carolinas to build nuclear units. Through several separate orders, the NCUC and PSCSC concurred with the prudency of Duke Energy Carolinas incurring certain project development and pre-construction costs, although recovery of costs is not guaranteed. Duke Energy Carolinas has incurred approximately   $427 million  , including AFUDC through   December 31, 2014  . This amount is included in   Net property, plant and equipment   on Duke Energy Carolinas  Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Design changes have been identified in the Westinghouse AP1000 certified design that must be addressed before NRC can complete its review of the Lee Nuclear Station COL application. These design changes set the schedule for completion of the NRC COL application review and issuance of the Lee COL. Receipt of the Lee Nuclear Station COL is currently expected by mid-2016. 
  Duke Energy Progress 
  2012 North Carolina Rate Case 
  On May 30, 2013, the NCUC approved a settlement agreement related to Duke Energy Progress  request for a rate increase. The Public Staff was a party to the settlement agreement. The settling parties agreed to a two-year step-in rate increase, with the first year providing for a   $147 million  , or a   4.5 percent   average increase in rates, and the second year providing for rates to be increased by an additional   $31 million  , or a   1.0 percent   average increase in rates. The agreement is based upon a return on equity of   10.2 percent   and an equity component of the capital structure of   53 percent  . The settlement agreement (i) allows for the recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than when the outage occurs, (ii) a   $20 million   shareholder contribution to agencies that provide energy assistance to low-income customers, and (iii) a reduction in the regulatory liability for costs of removal of   $20 million   for the first year. The initial rate increase went into effect on   June 1, 2013   and the step-in rate increase went into effect in June 2013. 
  On July 1, 2013, the NCAG appealed the NCUC s approval of the rate of return and capital structure included in the agreement. NC WARN also appealed various matters in the settlement. On August 20, 2014, the NCSC affirmed the NCUC's order approving Duke Energy Progress' rate of return and capital structure concluding the appeal. 
  L.V. Sutton Combined Cycle Facility

   Shearon Harris Nuclear Station Expansion 
  In 2006, Duke Energy Progress selected a site at Harris to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion. On February 19, 2008, Duke Energy Progress filed its COL application with the NRC for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at Harris, which the NRC docketed for review. On May 2, 2013, Duke Energy Progress filed a letter with the NRC requesting the NRC to suspend its review activities associated with the COL at the Harris site. As a result of the decision to suspend the COL applications, during the second quarter of 2013, Duke Energy Progress recorded a pretax impairment charge of   $22 million   which represented costs associated with the COL, which were not probable of recovery. As of   December 31, 2014  , approximately   $48 million   is recorded in   Regulatory assets   on Duke Energy Progress  Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Wholesale Depreciation Rates 
  On April 19, 2013, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with FERC for acceptance of changes to generation depreciation rates and in August 2013 filed for acceptance of additional changes. These changes affect the rates of Duke Energy Progress' wholesale power customers that purchase or will purchase power under formula rates. Certain Duke Energy Progress wholesale customers filed interventions and protests. FERC accepted the depreciation rate changes, subject to refund, and set the matter for settlement and hearing in a consolidated proceeding. FERC further initiated an action with respect to the justness and reasonableness of the proposed rate changes. Settlement was reached in October 2014 for changes to the depreciation rates and conforming changes to the wholesale formula rates. FERC approved the settlement in December 2014. The agreement will have no material or adverse impact to the rates originally proposed by Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Progress will receive cost recovery for early retired plants previously included in the depreciation rates. 
  Duke Energy Florida 
  FERC Transmission Return on Equity Complaint 
  On February 12, 2012, Seminole Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Florida Municipal Power Agency filed with FERC a complaint against Duke Energy Florida alleging that the current rate of return on equity in Duke Energy Florida's transmission formula rates of   10.8 percent   is unjust and unreasonable and should be reduced to   9.02 percent  . The complainants further alleged that return on equity adjustments should take effect retroactive to January 1, 2010 under the governing transmission formula rate protocols. On May 13, 2013, the complainants filed a second complaint alleging that the return on equity should be reduced to   8.63 percent   or   8.84 percent  . On June 19, 2014, FERC issued orders consolidating the two complaints, setting them for settlement and hearing procedures, setting refund effective dates of February 29, 2012 for the first complaint and May 13, 2013 for the second complaint, and setting for settlement and hearing the issue of whether return on equity adjustments should take effect prior to the refund effective date of the first complaint. On August 12, 2014, the complainants filed a third complaint alleging that the return on equity should be   8.69 percent  . On December 5, 2014, FERC issued an order consolidating the third complaint with the first two complaints for the purposes of settlement, hearing, and decision, and establishing a refund effective date of August 12, 2014 for the third complaint. The parties are engaged in settlement discussions. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  FPSC Settlement Agreements 
  On February 22, 2012, the FPSC approved a settlement agreement (the 2012 Settlement) among Duke Energy Florida, the Florida Office of Public Counsel (OPC) and other customer advocates. The 2012 Settlement was to continue through the last billing cycle of December 2016. On October 17, 2013, the FPSC approved a settlement agreement (the 2013 Settlement) between Duke Energy Florida, OPC, and other customer advocates. The 2013 Settlement replaces and supplants the 2012 Settlement and substantially resolves issues related to (i) Crystal River Unit 3, (ii) Levy, (iii) Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units, and (iv) future generation needs in Florida. Refer to the remaining sections below for further discussion of these settlement agreements. 
  Crystal River Unit 3  
  On February 5, 2013, Duke Energy Florida announced the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3. On February 20, 2013, Duke Energy Florida filed with the NRC a certification of permanent cessation of power operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel. In December 2013, and March 2014, Duke Energy Florida filed an updated site-specific decommissioning plan with the NRC and FPSC, respectively. The plan, which was approved by the FPSC in November 2014, included a decommissioning cost estimate of   $1,180 million  , including amounts applicable to joint owners, under the SAFSTOR option. Duke Energy Florida s decommissioning study assumes Crystal River Unit 3 will be in SAFSTOR configuration, requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions, until the eventual dismantling and decontamination activities to be completed by 2073. This decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number of retired domestic nuclear power plants and is one of three accepted approaches to decommissioning approved by the NRC. 
  Duke Energy Florida has reclassified all Crystal River Unit 3 investments, including property, plant and equipment, nuclear fuel, inventory, and other assets, to a regulatory asset. Duke Energy agreed to forgo recovery of   $295 million   of regulatory assets and an impairment charge was recorded in the second quarter of 2013 for this matter. Duke Energy Florida is allowed to accelerate cash recovery of approximately   $130 million   of the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset from retail customers from 2014 through 2016 through its fuel clause. Duke Energy Florida will begin recovery of the remaining Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset, up to a cap of   $1,466 million   from retail customers upon the earlier of (i) full recovery of the uncollected Levy investment or (ii) the first billing period of January 2017. Recovery will continue 240 months from inception of collection of the regulatory asset in base rates. The Crystal River Unit 3 base rate component will be adjusted at least every four years. 
  Included in this recovery, but not subject to the cap, are costs of building an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI). The return rate will be based on the currently approved AFUDC rate with a return on equity of   7.35 percent  , or 70 percent of the currently approved   10.5 percent  . The return rate is subject to change if the return on equity changes in the future. In December 2014, the FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida's decision to construct the ISFSI and approved Duke Energy Florida's request to defer amortization of the ISFSI pending resolution of its litigation against the federal government as a result of the Department of Energy's breach of its obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel. The regulatory asset associated with the original power uprate project to increase generating capacity will continue to be recovered through the Nuclear Cost Recovery Clause over an estimated seven-year period that began in 2013.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   Through   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy Florida deferred   $1,377 million   for rate recovery related to Crystal River Unit 3, which is subject to the rate recovery cap in the 2013 Settlement. In addition, Duke Energy Florida deferred   $260 million   for recovery associated with building an ISFSI and the original uprate project, which is not subject to the rate recovery cap discussed above. Duke Energy Florida does not expect the Crystal River Unit 3 costs to exceed the cap. 
  Customer Rate Matters 
  Pursuant to the 2013 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will maintain base rates at the current level through the last billing period of 2018, subject to the return on equity range of   9.5 percent   to   11.5 percent  , with exceptions for base rate increases for the recovery of the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset beginning no later than 2017 and base rate increases for new generation through 2018, per the provisions of the 2013 Settlement. Duke Energy Florida is not required to file a depreciation study, fossil dismantlement study or nuclear decommissioning study until the earlier of the next rate case filing or March 31, 2019. The 2012 Settlement provided for a   $150 million   increase in base revenue effective with the first billing cycle of January 2013. Costs associated with Crystal River Unit 3 investments were removed from retail rate base effective with the first billing cycle of January 2013. Duke Energy Florida is accruing, for future rate-setting purposes, a carrying charge on the Crystal River Unit 3 investment until the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset is recovered in base rates. If Duke Energy Florida s retail base rate earnings fall below the return on equity range, as reported on a FPSC-adjusted or pro forma basis on a monthly earnings surveillance report, it may petition the FPSC to amend its base rates during the term of the 2013 Settlement. 
  Duke Energy Florida agreed to refund   $388 million   to retail customers through its fuel clause, as required by the 2012 Settlement. At December 31, 2014,   $120 million   remains to be refunded, of which   $50 million   credit is recorded in Regulatory assets within Current Assets as an offset to deferred fuel and   $70 million   is recorded in Regulatory liabilities in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  Levy 
  On July 28, 2008, Duke Energy Florida applied to the NRC for a COL for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at Levy. In 2008, the FPSC granted Duke Energy Florida s petition for an affirmative Determination of Need and related orders requesting cost recovery under Florida s nuclear cost-recovery rule, together with the associated facilities, including transmission lines and substation facilities. Design changes have been identified in the Westinghouse AP1000 certified design that must be addressed before the NRC can complete its review of the Levy COL application. These design changes set the schedule for completion of the NRC COL application review and issuance of the Levy COL. Based on the current review schedule  ,   the Levy COL is currently expected by mid-2016. 
  On January 28, 2014, Duke Energy Florida terminated the Levy engineering, procurement and construction agreement (EPC). Duke Energy Florida may be required to pay for work performed under the EPC and to bring existing work to an orderly conclusion, including but not limited to costs to demobilize and cancel certain equipment and material orders placed. As of December 31, 2014, Duke Energy Florida has recorded an exit obligation of   $25 million   for the termination of the EPC. This liability was recorded within Other in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities with an offset primarily to Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Florida is allowed to recover reasonable and prudent EPC cancellation costs from its retail customers.  
  The 2012 Settlement provided that Duke Energy Florida include the allocated wholesale cost of Levy as a retail regulatory asset and include this asset as a component of rate base and amortization expense for regulatory reporting. In accordance with the 2013 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida ceased amortization of the wholesale allocation of Levy investments against retail rates. In the second quarter of 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded a pretax charge of   $65 million   to write off the wholesale portion of Levy investments. This amount is included in Impairment charges on Duke Energy Florida's Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
  On October 27, 2014, the FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida rates for 2015 for Levy as filed and consistent with those established in the 2013 Revised and Restated Settlement Agreement. Recovery of the remaining retail portion of the project costs may occur over five years from 2013 through 2017. Duke Energy Florida has an ongoing responsibility to demonstrate prudency related to the wind down of the Levy investment and the potential for salvage of Levy assets. As of   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy Florida has a net uncollected investment in Levy of approximately   $180 million  , including AFUDC. Of this amount,   $91 million   related to land and the COL is included in Net, property, plant and equipment and will be recovered through base rates and   $89 million   is included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be recovered through the NCRC. 
  Crystal River 1 and 2 Coal Units 
  Duke Energy Florida has evaluated Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units for retirement in order to comply with certain environmental regulations. Based on this evaluation, those units will likely be retired by 2018. Once those units are retired Duke Energy Florida will continue recovery of existing annual depreciation expense through the end of 2020. Beginning in 2021, Duke Energy Florida will be allowed to recover any remaining net book value of the assets from retail customers through the Capacity Cost Recovery Clause. In April 2014, the FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida's petition to allow for the recovery of prudently incurred costs to comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard through the Environmental Cost Recovery Clause. 
  New Generation 
  The 2013 Settlement establishes a recovery mechanism for additional generation needs. This recovery mechanism, the Generation Base Rate Adjustment, allows recovery of prudent costs of these items through an increase in base rates, upon the in-service date of such assets, without a general rate case at a   10.5 percent   return on equity.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   On May 27, 2014, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for a Determination of Need to (i) construct a 1,640 MW combined cycle natural gas plant in Citrus County, Florida to be in service in 2018 with an estimated cost of   $1.5 billion  , (ii) construct a 320 MW combustion turbine plant at its existing Suwannee generating facility (Suwannee project) with an estimated cost of   $197 million  , and (iii) add inlet chilling to its existing Hines Energy Complex (Hines) combined cycle units which will increase the output of those units by 220 MW at an estimated cost of   $160 million  . These cost estimates include AFUDC. On August 26, 2014, Duke Energy Florida requested the FPSC withdraw consideration for the Suwannee project so that Duke Energy Florida could pursue further negotiations on an alternative power plant acquisition. On October 2, 2014, the FPSC approved the requests for the Citrus County plant and the uprate project at the Hines facility. Additional environmental and governmental approvals will be sought for the Citrus County project. The Hines uprate project is expected to be completed no later than 2017.  
  In December 2014, Duke Energy Florida and Osprey Energy Center, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Calpine Corporation (Calpine) entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement for the purchase of a 599 MW combined cycle natural gas plant in Auburndale, Florida (Osprey Plant acquisition) for approximately   $166 million  . Closing is subject to the approval of FERC, FPSC and the expiration of the Hart Scott Rodino waiting period and is expected to occur by the first quarter of 2017 upon the expiration of an existing Power Purchase Agreement between Calpine and Duke Energy Florida. On January 30, 2015, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC requesting a determination that the Osprey Plant acquisition or, alternatively, the Suwannee project is the most cost effective generation alternative to meet Duke Energy Florida's remaining need prior to 2018. 
  Cost of Removal Reserve 
  The 2012 Settlement and the 2013 Settlement provide Duke Energy Florida the discretion to reduce cost of removal amortization expense for a certain portion of the cost of removal reserve until the earlier of its applicable cost of removal reserve reaches zero or the expiration of the 2013 Settlement. Duke Energy Florida may not reduce amortization expense if the reduction would cause it to exceed the appropriate high point of the return on equity range. Duke Energy Florida recognized a reduction in amortization expense of   $114 million  , and   $178 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2013  , and   2012   respectively. Duke Energy Florida had no cost of removal reserves eligible for amortization to income remaining at December 31, 2013. 
  Duke Energy Ohio 
  W.C. Beckjord Fuel Release 
  On August 18, 2014, approximately   9,000   gallons of fuel oil were inadvertently discharged into the Ohio River during a fuel oil transfer at the W.C. Beckjord generating plant. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) issued a Notice of Violation related to the discharge. Duke Energy Ohio is cooperating with the Ohio EPA, the EPA and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, responding to a Request for Information from the EPA. No Notice of Violation has been issued by the EPA and no civil or criminal penalty amount has been established. Total repair and remediation costs related to the release are not expected to be material. Other costs related to the release, including state or federal civil enforcement proceedings, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  
  2014 Electric Security Plan (ESP) 
  On May 29, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for approval of an SSO in the form of an ESP, effective June 1, 2015. The proposed ESP includes a competitive procurement process for SSO load, a distribution capital investment rider, a tracking mechanism for incremental distribution costs caused by major storms, and a cost-based recovery of Duke Energy Ohio s contractual entitlement in OVEC. The proposed plan also seeks rate design modifications and continuance, revision, or termination of existing riders. An evidentiary hearing in this case concluded in November 2014 and final briefs were submitted in December 2014. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  Capacity Rider Filing 
  On August 29, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio applied to the PUCO for the establishment of a charge for capacity provided pursuant to its obligations as a Fixed Resource Requirement entity. The charge, which was consistent with Ohio s state compensation mechanism, was estimated to be approximately   $729 million  , and reflected Duke Energy Ohio s embedded cost of capacity. On February 13, 2014, the PUCO denied Duke Energy Ohio s request. 
  2012 Electric Rate Case 
  On   May 1, 2013  , the PUCO approved a settlement agreement between Duke Energy Ohio and all intervening parties (the Electric Settlement) related to Duke Energy Ohio s electric distribution rate case. The Electric Settlement provides for a net increase in electric distribution revenues of   $49 million  , or an average increase of   2.9 percent  , based upon a return on equity of   9.84 percent  . Revised rates were effective in May 2013. 
  2012 Natural Gas Rate Case 
  On November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an order approving a settlement among Duke Energy Ohio, the PUCO Staff and intervening parties (the Gas Settlement). The Gas Settlement provided for (i) no increase in base rates for natural gas distribution service and (ii) a return on equity of   9.84 percent  . The Gas Settlement provided for a subsequent hearing on Duke Energy Ohio s request for rider recovery of environmental remediation costs associated with its former MGP sites. After the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing and briefs, the PUCO authorized Duke Energy Ohio to recover   $56 million  , excluding carrying costs, of environmental remediation costs. The MGP rider became effective in April 2014 for a five-year period. On March 31, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application with the PUCO to adjust the MGP rider for investigation and remediation costs incurred in 2013. As of December 31, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio has a balance of   $115 million   in Regulatory assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to MGP sites which includes the   $56 million   authorized for recovery in the rate case.

   On May 14, 2014, the Ohio Supreme Court granted certain consumer groups' motion to stay the MGP rider pending their appeals of the PUCO approval of the Gas Settlement and Duke Energy Ohio suspended billing of the MGP rider in June 2014. Amounts collected under the rider prior to suspension were immaterial. The appellants, the PUCO and Duke Energy Ohio all filed briefs addressing the merits of this matter with the Ohio Supreme Court. On July 29, 2014, the Ohio Supreme Court denied Duke Energy Ohio's motion to lift the stay, but required appellants to post a bond. The Ohio Supreme Court also requested briefs on the appropriate amount of the bond. On November 5, 2014, the Ohio Supreme Court ordered the Appellants to post a bond of approximately   $2.5 million   to continue the stay of the rider. The bond was to be posted within ten days or the stay would be lifted. The Appellants failed to post the required bond and on November 18, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio requested the PUCO to reinstate the MGP rider. The PUCO approved reinstatement of the rider on January 15, 2015 and Duke Energy Ohio began billings of the MGP rider. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of the appeals in this matter. 
  Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) Realignment 
  Duke Energy Ohio, including Duke Energy Kentucky, transferred control of its transmission assets from MISO to PJM, effective December 31, 2011. 
  On December 22, 2010, the KPSC approved Duke Energy Kentucky s request to effect the RTO realignment, subject to a commitment not to seek double-recovery in a future rate case of the transmission expansion fees that may be charged by MISO and PJM in the same period or overlapping periods. 
  On May 25, 2011, the PUCO approved a settlement between Duke Energy Ohio, Ohio Energy Group, the Office of the Ohio Consumers  Counsel and the PUCO Staff related to Duke Energy Ohio s recovery of certain costs of the RTO realignment via a non-bypassable rider. Duke Energy Ohio is allowed to recover all MISO Transmission Expansion Planning (MTEP) costs, including but not limited to Multi Value Project (MVP) costs, directly or indirectly charged to Ohio customers. Duke Energy Ohio also agreed to vigorously defend against any charges for MVP projects from MISO. 
  Upon its exit from MISO on December 31, 2011, Duke Energy Ohio recorded a liability for its exit obligation and share of MTEP costs, excluding MVP. This liability was recorded within Other in Current liabilities and Other in Deferred credits and other liabilities on Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of Duke Energy Ohio s recorded obligations related to its withdrawal from MISO. As of   December 31, 2014  ,   $74 million   is recorded as a Regulatory asset on Duke Energy Ohio's Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  MVP.   MISO approved   17   MVP proposals prior to Duke Energy Ohio s exit from MISO on December 31, 2011. Construction of these projects is expected to continue through 2020. Costs of these projects, including operating and maintenance costs, property and income taxes, depreciation and an allowed return, are allocated and billed to MISO transmission owners. 
  On December 29, 2011, MISO filed a tariff with the FERC providing for the allocation of MVP costs to a withdrawing owner based on monthly energy usage. The FERC set for hearing (i) whether MISO s proposed cost allocation methodology to transmission owners who withdrew from MISO prior to January 1, 2012, is consistent with the tariff at the time of their withdrawal from MISO, and, (ii) if not, what the amount of and methodology for calculating any MVP cost responsibility should be. On July 16, 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued an initial decision. Under this initial decision, Duke Energy Ohio would be liable for MVP costs. Duke Energy Ohio filed exceptions to the initial decision, requesting the FERC overturn the ALJ s decision. After reviewing the initial decision, along with all exceptions and responses filed by the parties, the FERC will issue a final decision. Duke Energy Ohio fully intends to appeal to the federal court of appeals if the FERC affirms the ALJ s decision. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. 
  In 2012, MISO estimated Duke Energy Ohio s MVP obligation over the period from 2012 to 2071 at   $2.7 billion  , on an undiscounted basis. The estimated obligation is subject to great uncertainty including the ultimate cost of the projects, the annual costs of operations and maintenance, taxes and return over the project lives, the number of years in service for the projects and the allocation to Duke Energy Ohio. 
  Any liability related to the MISO MVP matter attributable to the Disposal Group will not be transferred to Dynegy upon closing of the disposal of the Midwest generation business.

   FERC Transmission Return on Equity and MTEP Cost Settlement 
  On October 14, 2011, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky submitted with FERC proposed modifications to the PJM Interconnection Open Access Transmission Tariff pertaining to recovery of the transmission revenue requirement as PJM transmission owners. The filing was made in connection with the Duke Energy Ohio's and Duke Energy Kentucky's move from MISO to PJM effective January 1, 2012. On April 24, 2012, FERC issued an order accepting the proposed filing effective January 1, 2012, except that the order denied a request to recover certain costs associated with the move from MISO to PJM without prejudice to the right to submit another filing seeking such recovery and including certain additional evidence, and set the rate of return on equity of   12.38 percent   for settlement and hearing. A February 2013 settlement agreement filed with the FERC was rejected in September 2013. On October 30, 2014, the companies and six PJM transmission customers with load in the Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky zone filed with FERC for approval of another settlement agreement. The principal terms of the settlement agreement are that, effective upon the date of FERC approval, (i) the return on equity will be reduced from   12.38 percent   to   11.38 percent   and (ii) Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky will recover   30 percent   of costs arising from their obligation to pay any portion of the costs of projects included in any MTEP that was approved prior to the date of the Duke Energy Ohio's and Duke Energy Kentucky's integration into PJM. The settlement is pending FERC approval. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky cannot predict the outcome of this matter  
  Duke Energy Indiana 
  Edwardsport IGCC Plant 
  On November 20, 2007, the IURC granted Duke Energy Indiana a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the construction of a   618   MW IGCC power plant at Duke Energy Indiana s existing Edwardsport Generating Station in Knox County, Indiana with a cost estimate of   $1.985 billion   assuming timely recovery of financing costs related to the project. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc., Sierra Club, Inc., Save the Valley, Inc., and Valley Watch, Inc. (collectively, the Joint Intervenors) were intervenors in several matters related to the Edwardsport IGCC Plant. 
  On December 27, 2012, the IURC approved a settlement agreement (the 2012 Edwardsport settlement) related to the cost increase for the construction of the project, including subdockets before the IURC related to the project. The Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC), the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel-Indiana were parties to the settlement. The settlement agreement, as approved, capped costs to be reflected in customer rates at   $2.595 billion  , including estimated AFUDC through June 30, 2012. Duke Energy Indiana is allowed to recover AFUDC after June 30, 2012, until customer rates are revised, with such recovery decreasing to   85 percent   on AFUDC accrued after November 30, 2012.  
  Over the course of construction of the project to date, Duke Energy Indiana has recorded pretax charges of approximately   $897 million   related to the project and the settlement agreement discussed above. Of this amount, pretax impairment and other charges of   $631 million   were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012. These charges were recorded in Impairment charges and Operations, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Indiana's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
  The project was placed in commercial operation in June 2013. Costs for the Edwardsport IGCC plant are recovered from retail electric customers through a tracking mechanism, the IGCC rider. Updates to the IGCC rider are filed semi-annually. An order on the eleventh semi-annual IGCC rider is currently pending. The twelfth and thirteenth semi-annual IGGC riders were combined into one proceeding. In this proceeding, the OUCC, Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Joint Intervenors alleged the Edwardsport IGCC plant was not properly placed in commercial operation in June 2013 and therefore operating and maintenance costs for the time period June 2013 through March 2014 should not be recoverable. The Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Joint Intervenors also argued that the plant's performance was unsatisfactory during the first ten months of operations and recommended cost recovery disallowances. Evidentiary hearings concluded in February 2015 and an order is expected in the second half of 2015.  
  On March 18, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals denied an appeal filed by the Joint Intervenors and affirmed the IURC order approving the 2012 Edwardsport settlement and other related regulatory orders. On June 5, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the decision on rehearing. The Joint Intervenors requested to seek transfer to the Indiana Supreme Court. On November 7, 2014, the Indiana Supreme Court denied the Joint Intervenors' request to transfer the appeal of these proceedings. The ninth and tenth semi-annual IGCC rider orders have also been appealed. On August 21, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the IURC order in the tenth IGCC rider proceeding, and on October 29, 2014, denied Joint Intervenors' request for rehearing. The Joint Intervenors have requested a transfer of the matter to the Indiana Supreme Court. On September 8, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals remanded the IURC order in the ninth IGCC rider proceeding back to the IURC for further findings concerning approximately   $61 million   of financing charges Joint Intervenors claimed were caused by construction delay and a ratemaking issue concerning the in-service date determination for tax purposes. On February 25, 2015, the IURC issued an order on remand that upheld its prior order and added additional findings on the two issues as requested by the Indiana Court of Appeals. First, the IURC concluded the schedule delays in the construction of the IGCC plant were not the result of imprudence or unreasonable actions by Duke Energy Indiana and therefore recovery of the financing costs were appropriate. On the second issue, the IURC determined the federal tax in-service determination was to be made by the Internal Revenue Service, not the IURC, and the IURC appropriately reviewed and accepted the impact of such decision on customer rates in this and prior proceedings.  
  On April 2, 2014, the IURC established a subdocket to Duke Energy Indiana s current fuel adjustment clause proceeding. In this fuel adjustment subdocket, the IURC intends to review underlying causes for net negative generation amounts at the Edwardsport IGCC plant during the period September through November 2013. Duke Energy Indiana contends the net negative generation is related to the consumption of fuel and auxiliary power when the plant was in start-up or off line. In addition to the OUCC, the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group, Nucor Steel-Indiana, Steel Dynamics, Inc., and the Joint Intervenors are parties to the subdocket. The IURC has deferred the fuel adjustment subdocket until resolution of the twelfth and thirteenth semi-annual IGCC rider proceedings. In addition, although the IURC approved fuel adjustment clause recovery for the period December 2013 through March 2014, it determined such fuel costs reasonably related to the operational performance of the Edwardsport IGCC plant shall be subject to refund pending the outcome of the twelfth and thirteenth semi-annual IGCC riders. 
  Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of the fuel adjustment clause proceedings or pending and future IGCC Rider proceedings.

   FERC Transmission Return on Equity Complaint 
  On November 12, 2013, customer groups filed with FERC a complaint against MISO and its transmission-owning members, including Duke Energy Indiana, alleging, among other things, that the current base rate of return on equity earned by MISO transmission owners of   12.38 percent   is unjust and unreasonable and should be reduced to   9.15 percent  . On October 16, 2014, FERC issued an order setting the return on equity issue for settlement and hearing and establishing a refund effective date of November 12, 2013. On November 6, 2014, the MISO transmission owners submitted revisions to the MISO tariff to implement a   0.50 percent   adder to the base return on equity based on participation in a RTO. On January 5, 2015, FERC issued an order accepting the adder subject to it being applied to a base return on equity that is shown to be just and reasonable in the pending base return on equity complaint. On January 5, 2015, settlement procedures in the base return on equity proceeding were terminated and a hearing was scheduled for August 17, 2015. On February 12, 2015, certain MISO transmission customers filed with FERC a complaint alleging that the base return on equity should be   8.67 percent   and requesting consolidation with the pending base return on equity complaint. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  Grid Infrastructure Improvement Plan 
  On August 29, 2014, Duke Energy Indiana filed a seven-year grid infrastructure improvement plan with the IURC with an estimated cost of   $1.9 billion  , focusing on the reliability, integrity and modernization of the transmission and distribution system. If approved,   80 percent   of the costs will be recovered through a rate rider. The remaining   20 percent   are subject to recovery through future rate case proceedings. Hearings were held in January 2015 and Duke Energy Indiana expects a decision in the second quarter of 2015.  
  Other Regulatory Matters 
  Atlantic Coast Pipeline 
  On September 2, 2014, Duke Energy, Dominion Resources (Dominion), Piedmont Natural Gas and AGL Resources announced the formation of a joint venture, Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC, to build and own the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP), a 550-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. The ACP is designed to meet the needs identified in requests for proposals by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont Natural Gas. Dominion will build and operate the ACP and will own   45 percent  . Duke Energy will own   40 percent   of the pipeline through its Commercial Power segment. The remaining share will be owned by Piedmont Natural Gas and AGL Resources. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress will be customers of the pipeline and enter into 20-year transportation capacity contracts with ACP, subject to state regulatory approval. In October 2014, the NCUC and PSCSC approved the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress requests to enter into certain affiliate agreements, pay compensation to ACP and to grant a waiver of certain Code of Conduct provisions relating to contractual and jurisdictional matters. The project will require FERC approval, which the joint venture will seek to secure by summer 2016. The estimated in-service date of the pipeline is late 2018.  
  East Bend Station 
  On December 30, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio acquired The Dayton Power and Light Company s   31 percent   interest in East Bend Station for approximately   $12.4 million  . The purchase price has been reflected in the accompanying financial statements with the net purchase amount as an increase to property, plant and equipment in accordance with FERC guidelines. Duke Energy Ohio expects FERC approval to present the property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation at The Dayton Power and Light Company's historical cost.  
  NC WARN FERC Complaint 
  On December 16, 2014, NC WARN filed a complaint with the FERC against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress that alleged Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress manipulated the electricity market by constructing costly and unneeded generation facilities leading to unjust and unreasonable rates; Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress failed to comply with Order 1000 by not effectively connecting their transmission systems with neighboring utilities which also have excess capacity; the plans of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress for unrealistic future growth leads to unnecessary and expensive generating plants; FERC should investigate the practices of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and the potential benefits of having them enter into a regional transmission organization; and FERC should force Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to purchase power from other utilities rather than construct wasteful and redundant power plants. A copy of the complaint was filed with the PSCSC on January 6, 2015. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have filed a responses requesting dismissal of the complaint with the FERC and the PSCSC. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.  
  Merger Appeals 
  On January 9, 2013, the City of Orangeburg and NC WARN appealed the NCUC s approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. On April 29, 2013, the NCUC granted Duke Energy s motion to dismiss certain exceptions contained in NC WARN s appeal. 
  On March 4, 2014, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the NCUC s approval of the merger. On April 8, 2014, NC WARN filed a petition for discretionary review by the North Carolina Supreme Court. On April 21, 2014, Duke Energy and the Public Staff jointly filed their response opposing NC WARN s petition. The City of Orangeburg did not file a petition for discretionary review. On December 19, 2014, the North Carolina Supreme Court denied NC WARN's petition, concluding the appeal.

   Progress Energy Merger FERC Mitigation 
  In June 2012, the FERC approved the merger with Progress Energy, including Duke Energy and Progress Energy s revised market power mitigation plan, the Joint Dispatch Agreement (JDA) and the joint Open Access Transmission Tariff. Several intervenors filed requests for rehearing challenging various aspects of the FERC approval. On October 29, 2014, FERC denied all of the requests for rehearing. 
  The revised market power mitigation plan provided for the acceleration of one transmission project and the completion of seven other transmission projects (Long-Term FERC Mitigation) and interim firm power sale agreements during the completion of the transmission projects (Interim FERC Mitigation). The Long-Term FERC Mitigation was expected to increase power imported into the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress service areas and enhance competitive power supply options in the service areas. All of these projects were completed in or before 2014. On May 30, 2014, the Independent Monitor filed with FERC a final report stating that the Long-Term FERC Mitigation is complete. Therefore, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' obligations associated with the Interim FERC Mitigation have terminated. In the second quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Progress recorded an $18 million partial reversal of an impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2012. This reversal adjusts the initial disallowance from the Long-Term FERC mitigation and reflects updated information on the construction costs and in-service dates of the transmission projects. 
  Following the closing of the merger, outside counsel reviewed Duke Energy s mitigation plan and discovered a technical error in the calculations. On December 6, 2013, Duke Energy submitted a filing to the FERC disclosing the error and arguing that no additional mitigation is necessary. The City of New Bern filed a protest and requested that FERC order additional mitigation. On October 29, 2014, FERC ordered that the amount of the stub mitigation be increased from 25 MW to 129 MW. The stub mitigation is Duke Energy s commitment to set aside for third parties a certain quantity of firm transmission capacity from Duke Energy Carolinas to Duke Energy Progress during summer off-peak hours. FERC also ordered that Duke Energy operate certain phase shifters to create additional import capability and that such operation be monitored by an independent monitor. Duke Energy does not expect the costs to comply with this order to be material. FERC also referred Duke Energy s failure to expressly designate the phase shifter reactivation as a mitigation project in Duke Energy s original mitigation plan filing in March 2012 to the FERC Office of Enforcement for further inquiry. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this additional inquiry. 
  Planned and Potential Coal Plant Retirements 
  The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. Recent IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities in Florida, Ohio and Indiana earlier than their current estimated useful lives. These facilities do not have the requisite emission control equipment, primarily to meet EPA regulations recently approved or proposed. 
  The table below contains the net carrying value of generating facilities planned for early retirement or being evaluated for potential retirement included in Net property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, excluding the Duke Energy Carolinas 170 MW Lee Unit 3 which is being converted to gas in 2015.    

           (a) 
    Included in Net property, plant and equipment as of   December 31, 2014  , on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
              (b) 
    Includes Crystal River Units 1 and 2.  
              (c) 
    Includes Miami Fort Unit 6 which is expected to be retired by June 1, 2015.  
              (d) 
    Includes Wabash River Units 2 through 6. Wabash River Unit 6 is being evaluated for potential conversion to gas. Duke Energy Indiana committed to retire or convert these units by June 2018 in conjunction with a settlement agreement associated with the Edwardsport air permit.  
     Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives, and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these assets are retired. However, such recovery, including recovery of carrying costs on remaining book values, could be subject to future regulatory approvals and therefore cannot be assured. 
    5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  General Insurance 
  The Duke Energy Registrants have insurance and reinsurance coverage either directly or through indemnification from Duke Energy s captive insurance company, Bison, and its affiliates, consistent with companies engaged in similar commercial operations with similar type properties. The Duke Energy Registrants  coverage includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for liabilities arising to third parties for bodily injury and property damage; (ii) workers  compensation; (iii) automobile liability coverage; and (iv) property coverage for all real and personal property damage. Real and personal property damage coverage excludes electric transmission and distribution lines, but includes damages arising from boiler and machinery breakdowns, earthquakes, flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or replacement power coverage. All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or retentions, sublimits, exclusions, terms and conditions common for companies with similar types of operations.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   The Duke Energy Registrants self-insure their electric transmission and distribution lines against loss due to storm damage and other natural disasters. As discussed further in Note   4  , Duke Energy Florida maintains a storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of named storms on an expedited basis. 
  The cost of the Duke Energy Registrants  coverage can fluctuate year to year reflecting claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance markets. 
  In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance and reinsurance available might not be adequate to cover claims and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available. 
  Nuclear Insurance 
  Duke Energy Carolinas owns and operates the McGuire Nuclear Station (McGuire) and the Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee) and operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station (Catawba). McGuire and Catawba each have two reactors. Oconee has three reactors. The other joint owners of Catawba reimburse Duke Energy Carolinas for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Catawba joint owner agreements. 
  Duke Energy Progress owns and operates the Robinson Nuclear Station (Robinson) and operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Brunswick and Harris stations. Robinson and Harris each have one reactor. Brunswick has two reactors. The other joint owners of Brunswick and Harris reimburse Duke Energy Progress for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Brunswick and Harris joint owner agreements. 
  Duke Energy Florida manages and has a partial ownership interest in Crystal River Unit 3, which has been retired. The other joint owners of Crystal River Unit 3 reimburse Duke Energy Florida for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Crystal River Unit 3 joint owner agreement. 
  In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on Duke Energy Carolinas , Duke Energy Progress  and Duke Energy Florida s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available. 
  Nuclear Liability Coverage 
  The Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for public nuclear liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total financial protection liability. The maximum total financial protection liability, which is currently   $13.6 billion  , is subject to change every five years for inflation and the number of licensed reactors. Total nuclear liability coverage consists of a combination of private primary nuclear liability insurance coverage and a mandatory industry risk-sharing program to provide for excess nuclear liability coverage above the maximum reasonably available private primary coverage. The United States Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims. 
  Primary Liability Insurance 
  Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have purchased the maximum reasonably available private primary nuclear liability insurance as required by law, which currently is   $375 million   per station. 
  Excess Liability Program    
  This program provides   $13.2 billion   of coverage per incident through the Price-Anderson Act s mandatory industry-wide excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling. This amount is the product of potential cumulative retrospective premium assessments of   $127 million   times the current   104   licensed commercial nuclear reactors in U.S. Under this program, licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to compensate for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed facility in the U.S. Retrospective premiums may be assessed at a rate not to exceed   $19 million   per year per licensed reactor for each incident. The assessment may be subject to state premium taxes. 
  Nuclear Property and Accidental Outage Coverage 
  Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), an industry mutual insurance company, which provides "all risk" property damage, decontamination, and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. Additionally, NEIL provides some replacement power cost insurance for each station for losses in the event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear station. NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit rating or to ensure collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium or other means of assurance. The companies are required each year to report to the NRC the current levels and sources of insurance that demonstrate it possesses sufficient financial resources to stabilize and decontaminate its reactors and reactor station sites in the event of an accident.  
  Pursuant to regulations of the NRC, each company s property damage insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied, first, to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident, and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning, plant repair or restoration.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   Losses resulting from acts of terrorism are covered as common occurrences, such that if terrorist acts occur against one or more commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL within a 12-month period, they would be treated as one event and the owners of the plants where the act occurred would share one full limit of liability. The full limit of liability is currently   $3.2 billion  . NEIL sublimits the total aggregate for all of their policies for non-nuclear terrorist events to approximately   $1.83 billion  . 
  Each nuclear facility has accident property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits of   $1.5 billion  , except for Crystal River Unit 3. Crystal River Unit 3 s limit is   $1.1 billion   and is on an actual cash value basis. NEIL coverage for Crystal River 3 does not include property damage to or resulting from the containment structure except coverage does apply to decontamination and debris removal, if required following an accident, to ensure public health and safety or if property damage results from a terrorism event. All nuclear facilities except for Catawba and Crystal River Unit 3 also share an additional   $1.25 billion   nuclear accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. Catawba has a dedicated   $1.25 billion   of additional nuclear accident insurance limit above its dedicated underlying limit. Catawba and Oconee also have an additional   $750 million   of non-nuclear accident property damage limit. 
  NEIL s Accidental Outage policy provides some replacement power cost insurance for losses in the event of a major accident property damage outage of a nuclear unit. Coverage is provided on a weekly limit basis after a significant waiting period deductible and at   100 percent   of the available weekly limits for 52 weeks and   80 percent   of the available weekly limits for the next 110 weeks. Coverage is provided until policy aggregate limits are met where the accidental outage policy limit is   $490 million   for McGuire and Catawba,   $381 million   for Oconee,   $419 million   for Brunswick,   $384 million   for Harris and   $329 million   for Robinson. NEIL sublimits the accidental outage recovery to the first 104 weeks of coverage not to exceed   $328 million   from non-nuclear accidental property damage. Coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident.  
  Potential Retroactive Premium Assessments 
  In the event of NEIL losses, NEIL s board of directors may assess member companies retroactive premiums of amounts up to   10   times their annual premiums for up to   6 years   after a loss. NEIL has never exercised this assessment. The maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligations for Duke Energy Carolinas are   $73 million   for primary property insurance and   $32 million   for accidental outage insurance. The maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligations Duke Energy Progress are   $60 million   for primary property insurance and   $16 million   for accidental outage insurance. Duke Energy Carolinas maintains excess property insurance for Catawba with a maximum assessment of   $7 million  , and shares with Duke Energy Progress blanket excess property limits across other sites with a combined potential maximum assessment of   $17 million  . The current potential maximum assessments for Duke Energy Florida are   $8 million   for primary property insurance. The maximum assessment amounts include   100 percent   of Duke Energy Carolinas , Duke Energy Progress , and Duke Energy Florida s potential obligations to NEIL for their share of jointly owned reactors.

  The Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at various contaminated sites. These include some properties that are part of ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state and local agencies, activities vary with site conditions and locations, remediation requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held responsible for contamination caused by other potentially responsible parties, and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be estimated because the extent of environmental impact, allocation among potentially responsible parties, remediation alternatives, and/or regulatory decisions have not yet been determined. Additional costs associated with remediation activities are likely to be incurred in the future and could be significant. Costs are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable.

North Carolina and South Carolina Ash Basins 
  On February 2, 2014, a break in a 48-inch stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas  retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the 48-inch stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates   30,000   to   39,000   tons of ash and   24 million   to   27 million   gallons of basin water were released into the river during the incident. Duke Energy Carolinas incurred approximately   $24 million   of repairs and remediation expense related to this incident during the year ended   December 31, 2014  . These amounts are recorded in Operations, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Duke Energy Carolinas will not seek recovery of these costs from customers. In July, Duke Energy completed remediation work identified by the EPA and continues to cooperate with the EPA's civil enforcement process. See the "Litigation" section below for additional information on litigation, investigations, and enforcement actions related to ash basins. Other costs related to the Dan River release, including pending or future state or federal civil enforcement proceedings, future regulatory directives, natural resources damages, additional pending litigation, future claims or litigation, and long-term environmental impact costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
  On September 20, 2014, the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) became law. The Coal Ash Act (i) establishes a Coal Ash Management Commission to oversee handling of coal ash within the state; (ii) prohibits construction of new and expansion of existing ash impoundments and use of existing impoundments at retired facilities, effective October 1, 2014; (iii) requires closure of ash impoundments at Duke Energy Progress' Asheville and Sutton stations and Duke Energy Carolinas' Riverbend and Dan River stations no later than August 1, 2019; (iv) requires dry disposal of fly ash at active plants not retired by December 31, 2018; (v) requires dry disposal of bottom ash at active plants by December 31, 2019, or retirement of active plants; (vi) requires all remaining ash impoundments in North Carolina to be categorized as high-risk, intermediate-risk, or low-risk no later than December 31, 2015 by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) with the method of closure and timing to be based upon the assigned risk, with closure no later than December 31, 2029; (vii) establishes requirements to deal with groundwater and surface water impacts from impoundments and (viii) enhances the level of regulation for structural fills utilizing coal ash. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and modification of requirements regarding structural fills and compliance boundaries. Provisions of the Coal Ash Act prohibit cost recovery for unlawful discharge of ash basin waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act included a moratorium for any NCUC ordered rate changes to effectuate the legislation, which ended January 15, 2015. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal combustion residuals surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. In November 2014, Duke Energy submitted to DENR site specific coal ash excavation plans for the four high priority stations required to be closed no later than August 1, 2019. These plans and all associated permits must be approved by DENR before any excavation work can begin. 
  In September 2014, Duke Energy Carolinas executed a consent agreement with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) requiring the excavation of an inactive ash basin and ash fill area at the W.S. Lee Steam Station. As part of this agreement, in December 2014, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an ash removal plan and schedule with SCDHEC.

   Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded asset retirement obligations at   December 31, 2014   based upon the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act and the agreement with SCDHEC. Refer to Note   9   for further discussion of the asset retirement obligations recorded at   December 31, 2014  . 
  Coal Combustion Residuals  
  On December 19, 2014, the EPA signed the first federal regulation for the disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) from power plants. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments, structural fills and CCR piles. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the requirements of the federal CCR regulation, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be independently regulated by most states. Duke Energy records an asset retirement obligation when it has a legal obligation to incur retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Once the rule is effective in 2015, additional asset retirement obligation amounts will be recorded at the Duke registrants. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with state utility commissions, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations. At this time, Duke Energy is evaluating the CCR regulation and developing cost estimates that will largely be dependent upon compliance alternatives selected to meet requirements of the regulations. For further discussion of asset retirement obligations see Note   9  . 
  Litigation 
  Duke Energy 
  Ash Basin Shareholder Derivative Litigation 
  Five shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in Delaware Chancery Court relating to the release at Dan River and to the management of Duke Energy s ash basins. On October 31, 2014, the five lawsuits were consolidated in a single proceeding titled "In Re Duke Energy Corporation Coal Ash Derivative Litigation." On December 2, 2014, plaintiffs filed a Corrected Verified Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (Consolidated Complaint).  
  The Consolidated Complaint names as defendants several current and former Duke Energy officers and directors (collectively, the  Duke Energy Defendants ). Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. 
  The Consolidated Complaint alleges the Duke Energy Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the company by failing to adequately oversee Duke Energy s ash basins and that these breaches of fiduciary duty may have contributed to the incident at Dan River and continued thereafter. The lawsuit also asserts claims against the Duke Energy Defendants for corporate waste (relating to the money Duke Energy has spent and will spend as a result of the fines, penalties, and coal ash removal) and unjust enrichment (relating to the compensation and director remuneration that was received despite these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty). The lawsuit seeks both injunctive relief against Duke Energy and restitution from the Duke Energy Defendants. On January 21, 2015, the Duke Energy Defendants filed a Motion to Stay and an alternative Motion to Dismiss.  
  On May 28, 2014, Duke Energy received a shareholder litigation demand letter sent on behalf of shareholder Mitchell Pinsly. The letter alleges that the members of the Board of Directors and certain officers breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the company to illegally dispose of and store coal ash pollutants. The letter demands that the Board of Directors take action to recover damages associated with those breaches of fiduciary duty; otherwise, the attorney will file a shareholder derivative action. By letter dated July 3, 2014, counsel for the shareholder was informed that the Board of Directors appointed a Demand Review Committee to evaluate the allegations in the Demand Letter. 
  It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with these matters. 
  Progress Energy Merger Shareholder Litigation 
  Duke Energy, the eleven members of the Board of Directors who were also members of the pre-merger Board of Directors (Legacy Duke Energy Directors) and certain Duke Energy officers are defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit   (Nieman v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al)  . This lawsuit consolidates three lawsuits originally filed in July 2012, and is pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The plaintiffs allege federal Securities Act and Exchange Act claims based on allegations of materially false and misleading representations and omissions in the Registration Statement filed on July 7, 2011, and purportedly incorporated into other documents, all in connection with the post-merger change in Chief Executive Officer (CEO). On August 15, 2014, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation for an amount which, net of the expected proceeds of insurance policies, is not anticipated to have a material effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Duke Energy. On December 2, 2014, the parties executed a Memorandum of Understanding relating to the settlement which will be submitted to the court for approval. 
  On May 31, 2013, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated four shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in 2012. The Court also appointed a lead plaintiff and counsel for plaintiffs and designated the case as   In Re Duke Energy Corporation Derivative Litigation  . The lawsuit names as defendants the Legacy Duke Energy Directors. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. The case alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties of loyalty and care in connection with the post-merger change in CEO. The case is stayed pending resolution of the   Nieman v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al.   case in North Carolina.

   Two shareholder Derivative Complaints, filed in 2012 in federal district court in Delaware, were consolidated as   Tansey v. Rogers, et al.   The case alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets, as well as claims under Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. Pursuant to an Order entered on September 2, 2014, the court administratively closed this consolidated derivative action. The parties filed a status report with the court on December 1, 2014, and will continue to do so every six months thereafter until the Nieman v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al. case in North Carolina has been resolved.  
  On August 3, 2012, Duke Energy was served with a shareholder Derivative Complaint, which was transferred to the North Carolina Business Court (  Krieger v. Johnson, et al.).   The lawsuit names as defendants William D. Johnson and the Legacy Duke Energy Directors. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty in granting excessive compensation to Mr. Johnson. On April 30, 2014, the North Carolina Business Court granted the Legacy Duke Energy Directors  motion to dismiss the lawsuit. 
  It is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure of loss that may occur in connection with these lawsuits. 
  Price Reporting Cases 
  A total of five lawsuits were filed against Duke Energy affiliates and other energy companies and remain pending in a consolidated, single federal court proceeding in Nevada. Each of these lawsuits contain similar claims that defendants allegedly manipulated natural gas markets by various means, including providing false information to natural gas trade publications and entering into unlawful arrangements and agreements in violation of the antitrust laws of the respective states. Plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts. 
  On July 18, 2011, the judge granted a defendant s motion for summary judgment in two of the remaining five cases to which Duke Energy affiliates are a party. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently reversed the lower court s decision. On July 1, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendants', including Duke Energy, petition for certiorari. Oral argument was held on January 12, 2015. 
  It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with the remaining matters. However, based on Duke Energy s past experiences with similar cases of this nature, it does not believe its exposure under these remaining matters is material. 
  Brazil Expansion Lawsuit 
  On August 9, 2011, the State of S o Paulo sued Duke Energy International Geracao Paranapenema S.A. (DEIGP) in Brazilian state court. The lawsuit claims DEIGP is under a continuing obligation to expand installed generation capacity in the State of S o Paulo by   15 percent   pursuant to a stock purchase agreement under which DEIGP purchased generation assets from the state. On August 10, 2011, a judge granted an ex parte injunction ordering DEIGP to present a detailed expansion plan in satisfaction of the   15 percent   obligation. DEIGP has previously taken a position the expansion obligation is no longer viable given changes that have occurred in the electric energy sector since privatization. DEIGP submitted its proposed expansion plan on November 11, 2011, but reserved objections regarding enforceability. It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with this matter. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
  DENR State Enforcement Actions 
  In the first quarter of 2013, environmental organizations sent notices of intent to sue Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress related to alleged groundwater violations and Clean Water Act (CWA) violations from coal ash basins at two of their coal-fired power plants in North Carolina. DENR filed enforcement actions against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress alleging violations of water discharge permits and North Carolina groundwater standards. The case against Duke Energy Carolinas was filed in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The case against Duke Energy Progress was filed in Wake County Superior Court. The cases are being heard before a single judge. 
  On October 4, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and DENR negotiated a proposed consent order covering these two plants. The consent order would have assessed civil penalties and imposed a compliance schedule requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to undertake monitoring and data collection activities toward making appropriate corrective action to address any substantiated violations. In light of the coal ash release that occurred at Dan River on February 2, 2014, on March 21, 2014, DENR withdrew its support of the consent orders and requested that the court proceed with the litigation. 
  On August 16, 2013, DENR filed an enforcement action against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress related to their remaining plants in North Carolina, alleging violations of the CWA and violations of the North Carolina groundwater standards. The case against Duke Energy Carolinas was filed in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The case against Duke Energy Progress was filed in Wake County Superior Court. Both of these cases have been assigned to the judge handling the enforcement actions discussed above. Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), on behalf of several environmental groups, has been permitted to intervene in these cases. 
  It is not possible to predict any liability or estimate any damages Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress might incur in connection with these matters. 
  North Carolina Declaratory Judgment Action 
  On October 10, 2012, the SELC, on behalf of the same environmental groups that were permitted to challenge the consent decrees discussed above, filed a petition with the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) asking for a declaratory ruling seeking to clarify the application of the state s groundwater protection rules to coal ash basins. The petition sought to change the interpretation of regulations that permitted DENR to assess the extent, cause and significance of any groundwater contamination before ordering action to eliminate the source of contamination, among other issues. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress were both permitted to intervene in the matter. On December 3, 2012, the EMC affirmed this interpretation of the regulations.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   On March 6, 2014, the North Carolina State Court judge overturned the ruling of the EMC holding that in the case of groundwater contamination, DENR was required to issue an order to immediately eliminate the source of the contamination before an assessment of the nature, significance and extent of the contamination or the continuing damage to the groundwater was conducted. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, and the EMC appealed the ruling in April 2014. On May 16, 2014, the North Carolina Court of Appeals denied a petition to stay the case during the appeal. On October 10, 2014, the parties were notified the case has been transferred to the NCSC. Oral argument has been scheduled for March 16, 2015. 
  Federal Citizens Suits 
  There are currently five cases filed in various North Carolina federal courts contending that the DENR state enforcement actions discussed above do not adequately address the issues raised in the notices of intent to sue related to the Riverbend, Sutton, Cape Fear, H.F. Lee and Buck plants. 
  On June 11, 2013, Catawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. (Catawba Riverkeeper) filed a separate action in the United States Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The lawsuit contends the state enforcement action discussed above does not adequately address issues raised in Catawba Riverkeeper s notice of intent to sue relating to the Riverbend plant. On April 11, 2014, the Court denied Catawba Riverkeeper s objections to the Magistrate Judge s recommendation that plaintiff s case be dismissed as well as Duke Energy Carolinas  motion to dismiss. The Court allowed limited discovery, after which Duke Energy Carolinas may file any renewed motions to dismiss. 
  On September 12, 2013, Cape Fear River Watch, Inc., Sierra Club, and Waterkeeper Alliance filed a citizen suit in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The lawsuit alleges unpermitted discharges to surface water and groundwater violations at the Sutton plant. On June 9, 2014, the court granted Duke Energy Progress' request to dismiss the groundwater claims but rejected its request to dismiss the surface water claims. In response to a motion filed by the SELC, on August 1, 2014, the court modified the original June 9   th    order to dismiss only the plaintiff's federal law claim based on hydrologic connections at Sutton Lake. The claims related to the alleged state court violations of the permits are back in the case. 
  On September 3, 2014, three cases were filed by various environmental groups: (i) a citizen suit in the United States Court for the Middle District of North Carolina alleging unpermitted discharges to surface water and groundwater violations at the Cape Fear plant; (ii) a citizen suit in the United States Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina alleging unpermitted discharges to surface water and groundwater violations at the H.F. Lee plant; and (iii) a citizen suit in the United States Court for the Middle District of North Carolina alleging unpermitted discharges to surface water and groundwater violations at the Buck plant. On January 5, 2015, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion to Stay the proceeding relating to the Buck plant. 
  It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, they might incur in connection with these matters. 
  North Carolina Ash Basin Grand Jury Investigation 
  As a result of the Dan River ash basin water release discussed above, DENR issued a Notice of Violation and Recommendation of Assessment of Civil Penalties with respect to this matter on February 28, 2014, which the company responded to on March 13, 2014. Duke Energy and certain Duke Energy employees received subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina in connection with a criminal investigation related to the release and all   14   of the North Carolina facilities with ash basins and the nature of Duke Energy's contacts with DENR with respect to those facilities. This is a multidistrict investigation that also involves state law enforcement authorities. 
  On   February 20, 2015  , Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Business Services LLC (DEBS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, each entered into a Memorandum of Plea Agreement (Plea Agreements) in connection with the investigation initiated by the United States Department of Justice Environmental Crimes Section and the United States Attorneys for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the Middle District of North Carolina and the Western District of North Carolina (collectively, USDOJ). The Plea Agreements are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina and, if approved, will end the grand jury investigation related to the Dan River ash basin release and the management of coal ash basins at   14   plants in North Carolina with coal ash basins, as discussed above. 
  Under the Plea Agreements, the USDOJ charged DEBS and Duke Energy Progress with four misdemeanor CWA violations related to violations at Duke Energy Progress  H.F. Lee Steam Electric Plant, Cape Fear Steam Electric Plant and Asheville Steam Electric Generating Plant. The USDOJ charged Duke Energy Carolinas and DEBS with five misdemeanor CWA violations related to violations at Duke Energy Carolinas  Dan River Steam Station and Riverbend Steam Station. DEBS, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress also agreed (i) to a five-year probation period, (ii) to pay a total of approximately   $68 million   in fines and restitution and   $34 million   for community service and mitigation (the Payments), and (iii) to establish environmental compliance plans subject to the oversight of a court-appointed monitor paid for by the companies for the duration of the probation period (iii) for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress each to maintain   $250 million   under their Master Credit Facility as security to meet their obligations under the Pleas Agreements, in addition to certain other conditions set out in the Plea Agreements. Payments under the Plea Agreements will be borne by shareholders and are not tax deductible. Duke Energy Corporation has agreed to issue a guarantee of all payments and performance due from the Companies, including but not limited to payments for fines, restitution, community service, mitigation and the funding of, and obligations under, the environmental compliance plans. As a result of the Plea Agreements, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recognized charges of   $72 million   and   $30 million  , respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The amounts are recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
  The Plea Agreements do not cover pending civil claims related to the Dan River coal ash release and operations at other North Carolina coal plants. Duke Energy Corporation will continue to cooperate with government agencies and defend against remaining civil litigation associated with these matters.

   Duke Energy Carolinas 
  New Source Review 
  In 1999-2000, the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA filed a number of complaints and notices of violation against multiple utilities, including Duke Energy Carolinas, for alleged violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The government alleges the utilities violated the CAA when undertaking certain maintenance and repair projects at certain coal plants without (i) obtaining NSR permits and (ii) installing the best available emission controls for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. The complaints seek the installation of pollution control technology on generating units that allegedly violated the CAA, and unspecified civil penalties in amounts of up to   $37,500   per day for each violation. Duke Energy Carolinas asserts there were no CAA violations because the applicable regulations do not require NSR permitting in cases where the projects undertaken are  routine  or otherwise do not result in a net increase in emissions. 
  In 2000, the government sued Duke Energy Carolinas in the U.S. District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina, claiming NSR violations for   29   projects performed at   25   of Duke Energy Carolinas  coal-fired units. Duke Energy Carolinas asserts the projects were routine and not projected to increase emissions. The parties subsequently filed a stipulation agreeing to dismiss with prejudice all but   13   claims at   13   generating units,   11   of which have since been retired. The parties filed opposing motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims. The Court substantially denied both motions for summary judgment. A Duke Energy request for leave to file another motion for summary judgment on alternative grounds, including expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, was denied. On October 24, 2014, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to certify an appeal of the statute of limitations issue to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. That motion is pending. Trial date has been set for October 2015. It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy Carolinas will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with this matter. Ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Duke Energy Carolinas. However, the appropriate regulatory recovery will be pursued for costs incurred in connection with such resolution. 
  Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims 
  Duke Energy Carolinas has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement related to asbestos exposure. These claims relate to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted on its electric generation plants prior to 1985. As of   December 31, 2014  , there were   54   asserted claims for non-malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to   $11 million  , and   28   asserted claims for malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to   $7 million  . Based on Duke Energy Carolinas  experience, it is expected that the ultimate resolution of most of these claims likely will be less than the amount claimed. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas has recognized asbestos-related reserves of   $575 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   $616 million   at   December 31, 2013  . These reserves are classified in Other within Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These reserves are based upon the minimum amount of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through 2033, are recorded on an undiscounted basis and incorporate anticipated inflation. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2033 related to such potential claims. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention of   $476 million  . Duke Energy Carolinas  cumulative payments began to exceed the self-insurance retention in 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is   $864 million   in excess of the self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were   $616 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   $649 million   at   December 31, 2013  . These amounts are classified in Other within Investments and Other Assets and Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating. 
  Progress Energy 
  Synthetic Fuels Matters 
  Progress Energy and a number of its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants in lawsuits arising out of a 1999 Asset Purchase Agreement. Parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement include U.S. Global, LLC (Global) and affiliates of Progress Energy. 
  In a case filed in the Circuit Court for Broward County, Florida, in March 2003 (the Florida Global Case), Global requested an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, as well as declaratory relief. In November 2009, the court ruled in favor of Global. In December 2009, Progress Energy made a   $154 million   payment which represented payment of the total judgment, including prejudgment interest, and a required premium equivalent to two years of interest, to the Broward County Clerk of Court bond account. Progress Energy continued to accrue interest related to this judgment. 
  On October 3, 2012, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed the lower court ruling. The court held that Global was entitled to approximately   $90 million   of the amount paid into the registry of the court. Progress Energy was entitled to a refund of the remainder of the funds. Progress Energy received cash and recorded a   $63 million   pretax gain for the refund in December 2012. The gain was recorded in Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
  On May 9, 2013, Global filed a Seventh Amended Complaint asserting a single count for breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement and seeking specific performance. The parties reached a settlement in this matter in May 2014, and the case has been dismissed. The amount of the settlement did not have a material effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Progress Energy. As a result of the settlement of the Florida Global Case, a second suit filed in the Superior Court for Wake County, North Carolina,   Progress Synfuel Holdings, Inc. et al. v. U.S. Global, LLC  , has been dismissed.

   Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida 
  Spent Nuclear Fuel Matters 
  On December 12, 2011, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida sued the United States in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit claimed the Department of Energy breached a contract in failing to accept spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and asserted damages for the cost of on-site storage. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida asserted damages for the period January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2010. Claims for all periods prior to 2006 have been resolved. On March 24, 2014, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in favor of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida on this matter, awarding amounts of   $83 million   and   $21 million  , respectively. The majority of the awards were recorded as a reduction to capital costs associated with construction of on-site storage facilities. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida received payment of the award in September 2014. On October 16, 2014, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida filed a new action for costs incurred from 2011 through 2013.  
  Duke Energy Florida 
  Westinghouse Contract Litigation 
  On March 28, 2014 Duke Energy Florida filed a lawsuit against Westinghouse in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The lawsuit seeks recovery of   $54 million   in milestone payments in excess of work performed under the terminated EPC for Levy as well as a determination by the court of the amounts due to Westinghouse as a result of the termination of the EPC.  
  On March 31, 2014, Westinghouse filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Florida in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania lawsuit alleged damages under the EPC in excess of   $510 million   for engineering and design work, costs to end supplier contracts and an alleged termination fee.  
  On June 9, 2014, the judge in the North Carolina case ruled that the litigation will proceed in the Western District of North Carolina. In November 2014, Westinghouse filed a Motion for Partial Judgment on the pleadings which was denied by the Magistrate Judge on February 20, 2015, subject to court approval. Trial is set for February 2016. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation and whether Duke Energy Florida will incur any liability for terminating the EPC or to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with these matters. Ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of Duke Energy Florida. However, appropriate regulatory recovery will be pursued for the retail portion of any costs incurred in connection with such resolution. 
  Duke Energy Ohio 
  Antitrust Lawsuit 
  In January 2008, four plaintiffs, including individual, industrial and nonprofit customers, filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Ohio in federal court in the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs alleged Duke Energy Ohio conspired to provide inequitable and unfair price advantages for certain large business consumers by entering into non-public option agreements in exchange for their withdrawal of challenges to Duke Energy Ohio s Rate Stabilization Plan implemented in early 2005. In March 2014, a federal judge certified this matter as a class action. The parties have agreed to mediation on March 31, 2015. Trial has been set to begin on July 27, 2015. It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy Ohio will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, that may be incurred in connection with this matter. Ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Duke Energy Ohio.  
  Any liability related to the lawsuit attributable to the Disposal Group will not be transferred to Dynegy upon closing of the disposal of the Midwest generation business. 
  Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims 
  Duke Energy Ohio has been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits related to asbestos exposure at its electric generating stations. The impact on Duke Energy Ohio s results of operations, cash flows or financial position of these cases to date has not been material. Based on estimates under varying assumptions concerning uncertainties, such as, among others: (i) the number of contractors potentially exposed to asbestos during construction or maintenance of Duke Energy Ohio generating plants, (ii) the possible incidence of various illnesses among exposed workers, and (iii) the potential settlement costs without federal or other legislation that addresses asbestos tort actions, Duke Energy Ohio estimates that the range of reasonably possible exposure in existing and future suits over the foreseeable future is not material. This assessment may change as additional settlements occur, claims are made, and more case law is established.

   Duke Energy Indiana 
  Edwardsport IGCC 
  On December 11, 2012, Duke Energy Indiana filed an arbitration action against General Electric Company and Bechtel Corporation in connection with their work at the Edwardsport IGCC facility. Duke Energy Indiana is seeking damages equaling some or all of the additional costs incurred in the construction of the project not recovered at the IURC. The arbitration hearing concluded December 15, 2014. The parties will submit post hearing briefs. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  Other Litigation and Legal Proceedings 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are involved in other legal, tax and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve significant amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants believe the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
  The table below presents recorded reserves based on management s best estimate of probable loss for legal matters discussed above, excluding asbestos related reserves. Reserves are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other within Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities and Accounts payable and Other within Current Liabilities. The reasonably possible range of loss for all non-asbestos related matters in excess of recorded reserves is not material.   

  OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  General 
  As part of their normal business, the Duke Energy Registrants are party to various financial guarantees, performance guarantees, and other contractual commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries, investees, and other third parties. These guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not fully recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and have unlimited maximum potential payments. However, the Duke Energy Registrants do not believe these guarantees will have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
  Purchase Obligations 
  Purchased Power 
  Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have ongoing purchased power contracts, including renewable energy contracts, with other utilities, wholesale marketers, co-generators, and qualified facilities.

   Maturities and Call Options 
  The following table shows the annual maturities of long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter. Amounts presented exclude short-term notes payable and commercial paper and money pool borrowings for the Subsidiary Registrants.   

           (a) 
    Excludes   $1,975 million   in purchase accounting adjustments related to the merger with Progress Energy. See Note   2   for additional information. 
     The Duke Energy Registrants have the ability under certain debt facilities to call and repay the obligation prior to its scheduled maturity. Therefore, the actual timing of future cash repayments could be materially different than as presented above. 
  Short-Term Obligations Classified as Long-Term Debt 
  Tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder and certain commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings are classified as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These tax-exempt bonds, commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings, which are short-term obligations by nature, are classified as long term due to Duke Energy s intent and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term financing. As Duke Energy s Master Credit Facility and other bilateral letter of credit agreements have non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of the balance sheet date, Duke Energy has the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The following tables show short-term obligations classified as long-term debt.   

(a) 
    Instrument has a term of less than one year with the right to extend the maturity date for additional one-year periods with a final maturity date no later than December 2026.

In   January 2015  , Duke Energy amended the Master Credit Facility to increase its capacity to   $7.5 billion   through   January 2020  .   The Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, each have borrowing capacity under the Master Credit Facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower.   The amount available under the Master Credit Facility has been reduced to backstop the issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder. The table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under the Master Credit Facility.    

           (a)

              (b) 
    Duke Energy issued   $475 million   of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. The balances are classified as Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     On February 20, 2015, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and DEBS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, each entered into the Plea Agreements in connection with the investigation initiated by the USDOJ. Under the terms of the Plea Agreements, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are required to each maintain   $250 million   of available capacity under the Master Credit Facility as security to meet their obligations under the Plea Agreements, in addition to certain other conditions set out in the Plea Agreements. The Plea Agreements are subject to court approval. See Note   5   for further details. 
  Other Debt Matters 
  In September 2013, Duke Energy filed a registration statement (Form S-3) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by Duke Energy. 
  Duke Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to   $3 billion   of variable denomination floating-rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than   $1.5 billion   of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor s option at any time. The balance as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013   was   $968 million   and   $836 million  , respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

   At   December 31, 2014   and   2013  ,   $767 million   and   $811 million  , respectively, of debt issued by Duke Energy Carolinas was guaranteed by Duke Energy. 
  Money Pool    
  The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy receive support for their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating in this arrangement. The money pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, separately manage their cash needs and working capital requirements. Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and payables between money pool participants. Duke Energy (Parent), may loan funds to its participating subsidiaries, but may not borrow funds through the money pool. Accordingly, as the money pool activity is between Duke Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries, all money pool balances are eliminated within Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Money pool receivable balances are reflected within Notes receivable from affiliated companies on the Subsidiary Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Money pool payable balances are reflected within either Notes payable to affiliated companies or Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies on the Subsidiary Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Restrictive Debt Covenants 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. The Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio not exceed   65 percent   for each borrower. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of   December 31, 2014  , each of the Duke Energy Registrants were in compliance with all covenants related to their significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the significant debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses. 
  Other Loans 
  During 2014 and 2013, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Progress had loans outstanding against the cash surrender value of life insurance policies it owns on the lives of its executives. The amounts outstanding were   $603 million  , including   $44 million   at Duke Energy Progress and   $571 million  , including   $48 million   at Duke Energy Progress as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively. The amounts outstanding were carried as a reduction of the related cash surrender value that is included in Other within Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    7. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS  
  Duke Energy and Progress Energy have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications, which are issued in the normal course of business. As discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. Duke Energy and Progress Energy enter into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. At   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy and Progress Energy do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under these guarantees. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of the activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  On January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas businesses to shareholders. Guarantees issued by Duke Energy or its affiliates, or assigned to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained with Duke Energy subsequent to the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra Energy Capital, LLC, formerly known as Duke Capital LLC, (Spectra Capital) or its affiliates prior to the spin-off remained with Spectra Capital subsequent to the spin-off, except for guarantees that were later assigned to Duke Energy. Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Capital against any losses incurred under certain of the guarantee obligations that remain with Spectra Capital. At   December 31, 2014  , the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees was   $205 million  , the majority of which expires by 2028. 
  Duke Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of certain non-consolidated entities and less than wholly owned consolidated entities. If such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke Energy would be required under the guarantees to make payments on the obligations of the less than wholly owned entity. The maximum potential amount of future payments required under these guarantees as of   December 31, 2014  , was   $267 million  . Of this amount,   $15 million   relates to guarantees issued on behalf of less than wholly owned consolidated entities, with the remainder related to guarantees issued on behalf of third parties and unconsolidated affiliates of Duke Energy. Of the guarantees noted above,   $120 million   of the guarantees expire between 2015 and 2033, with the remaining performance guarantees having no contractual expiration. 
  Duke Energy has guaranteed certain issuers of surety bonds, obligating itself to make payment upon the failure of a wholly owned and former non-wholly owned entity to honor its obligations to a third party. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or former non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy had guaranteed   $44 million   of outstanding surety bonds, most of which have no set expiration. 
  Duke Energy uses bank-issued stand-by letters of credit to secure the performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party or customer. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations to the issuing bank which are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy had issued a total of   $452 million   in letters of credit, which expire between 2015 and 2020. The unused amount under these letters of credit was   $46 million  .

   Duke Energy and Progress Energy have issued indemnifications for certain asset performance, legal, tax and environmental matters to third parties, including indemnifications made in connection with sales of businesses. At   December 31, 2014  , the estimated maximum exposure for these indemnifications was   $107 million  , the majority of which expires in 2017. Of this amount,   $7 million   has no contractual expiration. For certain matters for which Progress Energy receives timely notice, indemnity obligations may extend beyond the notice period.   Certain indemnifications related to discontinued operations have no limitations as to time or maximum potential future payments.    
  The following table includes the liabilities recognized for the guarantees discussed above. These amounts are primarily recorded in Other within Deferred Credits and other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As current estimates change, additional losses related to guarantees and indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the future.    

    8. JOINT OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING AND TRANSMISSION FACILITIES  
  The Duke Energy Registrants hold ownership interests in certain jointly owned generating and transmission facilities. The Duke Energy Registrants are entitled to shares of the generating capacity and output of each unit equal to their respective ownership interests, except as outlined below. The Duke Energy Registrants pay their ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory purchases and operating expenses, except in certain instances where agreements have been executed to limit certain joint owners  maximum exposure to the additional costs. The Duke Energy Registrants share of revenues and operating costs of the jointly owned generating facilities is included within the corresponding line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each participant in the jointly owned facilities must provide its own financing, except in certain instances where agreements have been executed to limit certain joint owners  maximum exposure to the additional costs.  
  The following table presents the share of jointly owned plant or facilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All facilities are operated by the Duke Energy Registrants unless otherwise noted.

       9. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  
  Asset retirement obligations recognized by Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress relate primarily to decommissioning nuclear power facilities, closure of ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina, asbestos removal and closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Asset retirement obligations recognized at Duke Energy Florida relate primarily to decommissioning nuclear power facilities, asbestos removal and closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Ohio relate primarily to the retirement of natural gas mains, asbestos removal and closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Indiana relate primarily to obligations associated with asbestos removal and closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Duke Energy also has asset retirement obligations related to the removal of renewable energy generation assets in addition to the above items. Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants  assets have an indeterminate life, such as transmission and distribution facilities, and thus the fair value of the retirement obligation is not reasonably estimable. A liability for these asset retirement obligations will be recorded when a fair value is determinable. 
  The following table presents changes in the liability associated with asset retirement obligations.   

           (a) 
    Balances at December 31, 2013 and 2012, include   $8 million   and   $7 million  , respectively, reported in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress. 
              (b) 
    Substantially all accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 relates to Duke Energy s regulated electric operations and has been deferred in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment.  
              (c) 
    For 2014, amounts for Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress primarily relate to Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Amounts at Duke Energy also include impacts from Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies on purchase accounting amounts. For 2013, amounts for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Florida primarily relate to the site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. 
              (d) 
    Amounts relate to liability settlements for Crystal River Unit 3. 
              (e) 
    Amounts primarily relate to asset retirement obligations recorded as a result of the Coal Ash Act and an agreement with the SCDHEC related to the W.S. Lee Steam Station. 
     The Duke Energy Registrants  regulated operations accrue costs of removal for property that does not have an associated legal retirement obligation based on regulatory orders from state commissions. These costs of removal are recorded as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment. The Duke Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated cost of removal for any nonregulated assets. See Note   4   for the estimated cost of removal for assets without an associated legal retirement obligation, which are included in Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

   Ash Basins 
  As of December 31, 2014, as a result of the Coal Ash Act and the agreement with SCDHEC discussed in Note   5  , Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have asset retirement obligations in the amount of   $1,735 million   and   $1,792 million  , respectively, related to closure of ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina.  
  The asset retirement obligation amount is based upon estimated ash basin closure costs for each of Duke Energy's   32   ash basins located at   14   plants in North Carolina and an ash basin and ash fill area at a plant in South Carolina. The amount recorded represents the discounted cash flows for estimated ash basin closure costs based upon probability weightings of the potential closure methods as evaluated on a site by site basis. Actual costs to be incurred will be dependent upon factors that vary from site to site. The most significant factors are the method and timeframe of closure at the individual sites. Closure methods considered include removing the water from the basins and capping the ash with a synthetic barrier, excavating and relocating the ash to a lined structural fill or lined landfill, or recycling the ash for concrete or some other beneficial use. The ultimate method and timetable for closure will be in compliance with future standards set by the Coal Ash Management Commission established by the Coal Ash Act. The asset retirement obligation amounts will be adjusted as additional information is gained from the Coal Ash Management Commission on acceptable compliance approaches which may change management assumptions.  
  Asset retirement costs associated with the asset retirement obligations for operating plants and retired plants are included in Net property, plant and equipment, and Regulatory assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of the asset retirement obligations recorded,   $896 million   and   $603 million   were recorded in Net property, plant and equipment for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively, and   $839 million   and   $1,152 million   were recorded in Regulatory assets for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. The asset retirement costs recorded for Duke Energy Progress are net of   $37 million   of Regulatory liabilities related to cost of removal. Cost recovery for these expenditures is believed to be probable and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with the NCUC, PSCSC and FERC.  
  In December 2014, the EPA signed the first regulation for the disposal of CCR. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments, structural fills and CCR piles. The law establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. Once the rule is effective in 2015, additional ARO amounts will be recorded at the Duke Energy Registrants. For more information, see Note   5  .  
  Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 
  Use of the NDTF investments are restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The NDTF investments are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The fair value of assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations associated with nuclear decommissioning are   $5,182 million   and   $2,678 million   for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas at   December 31, 2014  , respectively, and   $4,769 million   and   $2,477 million   for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas at   December 31, 2013  , respectively. The NDTF balances for Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida represent the fair value of assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations associated with nuclear decommissioning. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require updated cost estimates for decommissioning nuclear plants every five years. 
  The following table summarizes information about nuclear decommissioning cost studies.   

           (a) 
    Represents cost per the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies, including costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination. 
              (b) 
    Includes the Subsidiary Registrants' ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors. 
              (c) 
    Amounts are in dollars of year of cost study. 
              (d) 
    In the fourth quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Carolinas requested from the NCUC a reduction in the annual funding requirement to zero. Duke Energy Carolinas received approval from the NCUC in January 2015. 
              (e) 
    Duke Energy Progress' site-specific cost nuclear decommissioning cost studies are expected to be filed with the NCUC and PSCSC by the second quarter of 2015. Duke Energy Progress will also complete a new funding study, which will be completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2015.

The expected amortization expense includes estimates of emission allowances consumption and estimates of consumption of commodities such as gas and coal under existing contracts, as well as estimated amortization related to the wind development projects. The amortization amounts discussed below are estimates and actual amounts may differ from these estimates due to such factors as changes in consumption patterns, sales or impairments of emission allowances or other intangible assets, delays in the in-service dates of wind assets, additional intangible acquisitions and other events.   

    12. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES 
  EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
  Investments in domestic and international affiliates that are not controlled by Duke Energy, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. As of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , the carrying amount of investments in affiliates with carrying amounts greater than zero approximated the amount of underlying equity in net assets. 
  The following table presents Duke Energy s investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method, as well as the respective equity in earnings, by segment.   

  During the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , Duke Energy received distributions from equity investments of   $154 million  ,   $144 million   and   $183 million  , respectively, which are included in Other assets within Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Significant investments in affiliates accounted for under the equity method are discussed below. 
  International Energy 
  Duke Energy owns a   25 percent   indirect interest in NMC, which owns and operates a methanol and MTBE business in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. 
  Commercial Power 
  Investments accounted for under the equity method primarily consist of Duke Energy s approximate   50 percent   ownership interest in the five Catamount Sweetwater, LLC wind farm projects (Phase I-V), INDU Solar Holdings, LLC and DS Cornerstone, LLC. All of these entities own solar or wind power projects in the United States. Duke Energy also owns a   50 percent   interest in Duke American Transmission Co., LLC, which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North America.

   13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  The Subsidiary Registrants engage in related party transactions, which are generally performed at cost and in accordance with the applicable state and federal commission regulations. Refer to the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Subsidiary Registrants for balances due to or due from related parties. Material amounts related to transactions with related parties included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income are presented in the following table.   

           (a) 
    The Subsidiary Registrants are charged their proportionate share of corporate governance and other shared services costs, primarily related to human resources, employee benefits, legal and accounting fees, as well as other third-party costs. These amounts are recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
              (b) 
    The Subsidiary Registrants incur expenses related to certain indemnification coverages through Bison, Duke Energy s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. These expenses are recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
              (c) 
    Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress participate in a JDA which allows the collective dispatch of power plants between the service territories to reduce customer rates. Revenues from the sale of power under the JDA are recorded in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Expenses from the purchase of power under the JDA are recorded in Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
              (d) 
    In 2013 and 2012, Progress Energy Service Company (PESC), a consolidated subsidiary of Progress Energy, charged a proportionate share of corporate governance and other costs to consolidated affiliates of Duke Energy. Corporate governance and other shared costs were primarily related to human resources, employee benefits, legal and accounting fees, as well as other third-party costs. These charges were recorded as an offset to Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Effective January 1, 2014, PESC was contributed to Duke Energy Corporate Services (DECS), a consolidated subsidiary of Duke Energy, and these costs were no longer charged out of Progress Energy. Progress Energy recorded a non-cash after-tax equity transfer related to the contribution of PESC to DECS in its Consolidated Statements of Changes in Common Stockholder's Equity.  
     In addition to the amounts presented above, the Subsidiary Registrants record the impact on net income of other affiliate transactions, including rental of office space, participation in a money pool arrangement, other operational transactions and their proportionate share of certain charged expenses. See Note   6   for more information regarding money pool. The net impact of these transactions was not material for the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   for the Subsidiary Registrants.

   As discussed in Note   17  , certain trade receivables have been sold by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana to CRC, an affiliate formed by a subsidiary of Duke Energy. The proceeds obtained from the sales of receivables are largely cash but do include a subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the purchase price. 
  In January 2012, Duke Energy Ohio recorded a non-cash equity transfer of   $28 million   related to the sale of Vermillion to Duke Energy Indiana. Duke Energy Indiana recorded a non-cash after-tax equity transfer of   $26 million   for the purchase of Vermillion from Duke Energy Ohio. See Note   2   for further discussion. 
  Duke Energy Commercial Asset Management (DECAM) is a nonregulated, indirect subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio that owns generating plants included in the Disposal Group discussed in Note   2  . DECAM's business activities include the execution of commodity transactions, third-party vendor and supply contracts, and service contracts for certain of Duke Energy s nonregulated entities. The commodity contracts DECAM enters are accounted for as undesignated contracts or NPNS. Consequently, mark-to-market impacts of intercompany contracts with, and sales of power to, nonregulated entities are included in (Loss) Income from discontinued operations in Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. These amounts totaled net expense of   $24 million   and   $6 million   and net revenue of   $24 million  , for the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
  Because it is not a rated entity, DECAM receives credit support from Duke Energy or its nonregulated subsidiaries, not from the regulated utility operations of Duke Energy Ohio. DECAM meets its funding needs through an intercompany loan agreement from a subsidiary of Duke Energy. DECAM also has the ability to loan money to the subsidiary of Duke Energy. DECAM had an outstanding intercompany loan payable of   $459 million   and   $43 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively, These amounts are recorded in Notes payable to affiliated companies on Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  As discussed in Note   6  , in April 2014, Duke Energy issued   $1 billion   of senior unsecured notes. Proceeds from the issuances of approximately   $400 million   were loaned to DECAM, and such funds were ultimately used to redeem   $402 million   of tax-exempt bonds at Duke Energy Ohio. This transaction substantially completed the restructuring of Duke Energy Ohio s capital structure to reflect appropriate debt and equity ratios for its regulated operations. The restructuring was completed in the second quarter of 2014, and resulted in the transfer of all of Duke Energy Ohio s nonregulated generation assets, excluding Beckjord, out of its regulated public utility subsidiary and into DECAM. 
    14. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING 
  The Duke Energy Registrants use commodity and interest rate contracts to manage commodity price and interest rate risks. The primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against changes in the prices of electricity and natural gas. Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk associated with borrowings. 
  All derivative instruments not identified as NPNS are recorded at fair value as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral related to derivative instruments executed under master netting agreement is offset against the collateralized derivatives on the balance sheet. 
  Changes in the fair value of derivative agreements that either do not qualify for or have not been designated as hedges are reflected in current earnings or as regulatory assets or liabilities. 
  COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the impact of changes in the future prices of electricity, coal and natural gas. Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors including the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets, and delivery locations. 
  Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges 
  At   December 31, 2014  , there were no open commodity derivative instruments designated as hedges. 
  Undesignated Contracts 
  Undesignated contracts may include contracts not designated as a hedge, contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, derivatives that do not or no longer qualify for the NPNS scope exception, and de-designated hedge contracts. These contracts expire as late as   2018  . 
  Duke Energy Carolinas  undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward sales and purchases of electricity. Duke Energy Progress  and Duke Energy Florida s undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward purchases of natural gas. Duke Energy Ohio s undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward sales and purchases of electricity, coal, and natural gas. Duke Energy Indiana s undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward purchases and sales of electricity and financial transmission rights.

   Volumes 
  The tables below show information relating to volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives. Amounts disclosed represent the notional volumes of commodity contracts excluding NPNS. Amounts disclosed represent the absolute value of notional amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants have netted contractual amounts where offsetting purchase and sale contracts exist with identical delivery locations and times of delivery. Where all commodity positions are perfectly offset, no quantities are shown.    

(a) 
    Amounts at Duke Energy Ohio include intercompany positions that eliminate at Duke Energy. 
     INTEREST RATE RISK 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance or anticipated issuance of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Interest rate risk is managed by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with changes in interest rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury lock agreements, and other financial contracts. In anticipation of certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of forward starting interest rate swaps may be executed to lock in components of current market interest rates. These instruments are later terminated prior to or upon the issuance of the corresponding debt. Pretax gains or losses recognized from inception to termination of the hedges are amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt. 
  Duke Energy has a combination foreign exchange, pay fixed-receive floating interest rate swap to fix the U.S. dollar equivalent payments on a floating-rate Chilean debt issue. 
  The following tables show notional amounts for derivatives related to interest rate risk.

15. INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES 
  The Duke Energy Registrants classify their investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or available-for-sale. 
  TRADING SECURITIES 
  Investments in debt and equity securities held in grantor trusts associated with certain deferred compensation plans and certain other investments are classified as trading securities. The fair value of these investments was   $7 million   as of   December 31, 2014   and   $18 million   as of   December 31, 2013  . 
  AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES 
  All other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities. 
  Duke Energy s available-for-sale securities are primarily comprised of investments held in (i) the NDTF at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, (ii) grantor trusts at Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana related to OPEB plans, (iii) Duke Energy s captive insurance investment portfolio, and (iv) Duke Energy s foreign operations investment portfolio.

   Duke Energy holds corporate debt securities that were purchased using excess cash from its foreign operations. These investments are either classified as Cash and cash equivalents or Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on maturity date and are available for current operations of Duke Energy s foreign business. The fair value of these investments classified as Short-term investments was   $44 million   as of   December 31, 2013  . 
  Duke Energy classifies all other investments in debt and equity securities as long-term, unless otherwise noted.  
  Investment Trusts 
  The investments within the NDTF at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida and the Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana grantor trusts (Investment Trusts) are managed by independent investment managers with discretion to buy, sell, and invest pursuant to the objectives set forth by the trust agreements. The Duke Energy Registrants have limited oversight of the day-to-day management of these investments. As a result, the ability to hold investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants. Accordingly, all unrealized losses associated with debt and equity securities within the Investment Trusts are considered other-than-temporary impairments and are recognized immediately. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with investments within the Investment Trusts are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. As a result, there is no immediate impact on earnings of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  Other Available-for-Sale Securities 
  Unrealized gains and losses on all other available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income until realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the unrealized loss is included in earnings based on the criteria discussed below. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants analyze all investment holdings each reporting period to determine whether a decline in fair value should be considered other-than-temporary. Criteria used to evaluate whether an impairment associated with equity securities is other-than-temporary includes, but is not limited to, (i) the length of time over which the market value has been lower than the cost basis of the investment, (ii) the percentage decline compared to the cost of the investment, and (iii) management s intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value through a charge to earnings. 
  If the entity does not have an intent to sell a debt security and it is not more likely than not management will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its cost basis, the impairment write-down to fair value would be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, except for when it is determined a credit loss exists. In determining whether a credit loss exists, management considers, among other things, (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, (ii) changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset backed security, the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, (iii) consideration of underlying collateral and guarantees of amounts by government entities, (iv) ability of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and (v) any changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies. If a credit loss exists, the amount of impairment write-down to fair value is split between credit loss and other factors. The amount related to credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. There were no credit losses as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  . There were no other-than-temporary impairments for debt or equity securities as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  .

    16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Fair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. Fair value measurements use market data or assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs may be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize use of unobservable inputs. A midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint price between bid and ask prices) is permitted for use as a practical expedient. 
  Fair value measurements are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy: 
  Level 1     Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. An active market is one in which transactions for an asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information. 
  Level 2     A fair value measurement utilizing inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for an asset or liability. Inputs include (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, (iii) and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit spreads. A Level 2 measurement cannot have more than an insignificant portion of its valuation based on unobservable inputs. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives, such as over-the-counter forwards, swaps and options; certain marketable debt securities; and financial instruments traded in less than active markets. 
  Level 3     Any fair value measurement which includes unobservable inputs for more than an insignificant portion of the valuation. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value. Level 3 measurements may include longer-term instruments that extend into periods in which observable inputs are not available. 
  The fair value accounting guidance permits entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity method investments or the company s own debt, at fair value. The Duke Energy Registrants have not elected to record any of these items at fair value. 
  Transfers between levels represent assets or liabilities that were previously (i) categorized at a higher level for which the inputs to the estimate became less observable or (ii) classified at a lower level for which the inputs became more observable during the period. The Duke Energy Registrant s policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the period. There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  . Transfers out of Level 3 during the year ended   December 31, 2014   are the result of forward commodity prices becoming observable due to the passage of time. 
  Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows. 
  Investments in equity securities 
  The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. There was no after-hours market activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurements. Investments in equity securities that are Level 2 or 3 are typically ownership interests in commingled investment funds. 
  Investments in debt securities 
  Most investments in debt securities are valued using Level 2 measurements because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the market for a particular fixed income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3. 
  Commodity derivatives

  DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.   DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC. - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC. 
  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   Commodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. Other commodity derivatives are primarily fair valued using internally developed discounted cash flow models which incorporate forward price, adjustments for liquidity (bid-ask spread) and credit or non-performance risk (after reflecting credit enhancements such as collateral), and are discounted to present value. Pricing inputs are derived from published exchange transaction prices and other observable data sources. In the absence of an active market, the last available price may be used. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation, the commodity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments for gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustments for electricity sales contracts. Duke Energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estimate fair value of gas commodity contracts by a market participant price verification procedure. This procedure provides a comparison of internal forward commodity curves to market participant generated curves. 
  Interest rate derivatives 
  Most over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial models which utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional amounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties. 
  Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets and Assets Held for Sale 
  See Note   11   for a discussion of the valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets and Note   2   related to the assets and related liabilities of the Disposal Group classified as held for sale.

   OTHER FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
  The fair value and book value of long-term debt, including current maturities, is summarized in the following table. Estimates determined are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could have been settled in current markets. Fair value of long-term debt uses Level 2 measurements.   

  At both   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and commercial paper, and non-recourse notes payable of variable interest entities are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments and/or because the stated rates approximate market rates. 
    17. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
  A VIE is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than a simple analysis of voting control. The analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, the adequacy of the equity investment of an entity, and the relationship of voting power to the amount of equity invested in an entity. This analysis is performed either upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of an event requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entity s assets or activities. A qualitative analysis of control determines the party that consolidates a VIE. This assessment is based on (i) what party has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE that impact its economic performance, and (ii) what party has rights to receive benefits or is obligated to absorb losses that are significant to the VIE. The analysis of the party that consolidates a VIE is a continual reassessment.  
  No financial support was provided to any of the consolidated VIEs during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and 2012, or is expected to be provided in the future, that was not previously contractually required.

  The obligations of these VIEs are non-recourse to Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. These entities have no requirement to provide liquidity to, purchase assets of, or guarantee performance of these VIEs unless noted in the following paragraphs. 
  DERF / DEPR / DEFR 
  Duke Energy Receivables Finance Company, LLC (DERF), DEPR, and DEFR are bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. On a daily basis, DERF, DEPR, and DEFR buy certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and/or related services from their parent companies. DERF, DEPR, and DEFR are wholly owned limited liability companies with separate legal existence from their parents, and their assets are not generally available to creditors of their parent companies. DERF, DEPR, and DEFR borrow amounts under credit facilities to buy the receivables. Borrowing availability is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold, which is generally expected to be in excess of the credit facilities. The credit facilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt. The secured credit facilities were not structured to meet the criteria for sale accounting treatment under the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets.  
  The most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DERF, DEPR, and DEFR are the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Florida consolidate DERF, DEPR, and DEFR, respectively, as they make those decisions.

   The following table outlines amounts and expiration dates of the credit facilities.   

  CRC 
  On a revolving basis, CRC buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and/or related services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Receivables sold are securitized by CRC through a credit facility managed by two unrelated third parties. The proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana receive from the sale of receivables to CRC are typically   75 percent   cash and   25 percent   in the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note is a retained interest in the receivables sold. Cash collections from the receivables are the sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation. Depending on experience with collections, additional equity infusions to CRC may be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of   $3 million  . There were no infusions to CRC during the years ended   December 31, 2014   and   2013  . Borrowing availability is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold, which is generally expected to be in excess of the credit facility. The credit facility expires in   November 2016   and is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt. 
  CRC is considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, (ii) power to direct the most significant activities that impact economic performance of the entity are not performed by the equity holder, Cinergy, and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC are not funded by Cinergy, but by Duke Energy. The most significant activity of CRC relates to the decisions made with respect to the management of delinquent receivables. Duke Energy consolidates CRC as it makes these decisions. Neither Duke Energy Ohio nor Duke Energy Indiana consolidate CRC. 
  Renewables 
  Certain of Duke Energy s renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to long-term fixed price power purchase agreements. These fixed price agreements effectively transfer commodity price risk to the buyer of the power. Certain other of Duke Energy s renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. For certain VIEs, assets are restricted and cannot be pledged as collateral or sold to third parties without prior approval of debt holders. The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of these renewable energy facilities were decisions associated with siting, negotiating purchase power agreements, engineering, procurement and construction, and decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke Energy consolidates the entities as it makes all of these decisions. 
  NON-CONSOLIDATED VIEs 
  The tables below show VIEs not consolidated and how these entities impact the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

           (a) 
    Duke Energy Ohio recorded a pretax impairment charge of   $94 million   related to OVEC.  
       204

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

The Duke Energy Registrants are not aware of any situations where the maximum exposure to loss significantly exceeds the carrying values shown above except for the power purchase agreement with OVEC, which is discussed below, and various guarantees, some of which are reflected in the table above as Deferred credits and other liabilities. For more information on various guarantees, refer to Note   7  , "Guarantees and Indemnifications." 
  Renewables 
  Duke Energy has investments in various renewable energy project entities. Some of these entities are VIEs due to long-term fixed price power purchase agreements. These fixed price agreements effectively transfer commodity price risk to the buyer of the power. Duke Energy does not consolidate these VIEs because power to direct and control key activities is shared jointly by Duke Energy and other owners. 
  Other 
  At December 31, 2013, the most significant of the Other non-consolidated VIEs was Duke Energy Ohio s   9 percent   ownership interest in OVEC. Through its ownership interest in OVEC, Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement to buy power from OVEC s power plants through June 2040. The initial carrying value of this contract was recorded as an intangible asset when Duke Energy acquired Cinergy in April 2006. Proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC to its power purchase agreement counterparties are designed to be sufficient to meet its operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization and interest expense, as well as earn a return on equity. Accordingly, the value of this contract is subject to variability due to fluctuations in power prices and changes in OVEC s costs of business, including costs associated with its 2,256 MW of coal-fired generation capacity. Proposed environmental rulemaking could increase the costs of OVEC, which would be passed through to Duke Energy Ohio. In 2014, Duke Energy recorded a   $94 million   impairment related to OVEC. 
  CRC 
  See discussion under Consolidated VIEs for additional information related to CRC. 
  Amounts included in Receivables in the above table for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to CRC. These subordinated notes held by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are stated at fair value. Carrying values of retained interests are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between assets sold and interests retained based on relative fair value. The allocated bases of the subordinated notes are not materially different than their face value because (i) the receivables generally turnover in less than two months, (ii) credit losses are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration, and (iii) the equity in CRC is subordinate to all retained interests and thus would absorb losses first. The hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interests assuming both a   10 percent   and a   20 percent   unfavorable variation in credit losses or discount rates is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history. Interest accrues to Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana on the retained interests using the acceptable yield method. This method generally approximates the stated rate on the notes since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent. An impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interests and purchased beneficial interest whenever it is determined that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.

   Key assumptions used in estimating fair value are detailed in the following table.   

  The following table shows the gross and net receivables sold.   

  The following table shows sales and cash flows related to receivables sold.   

  Cash flows from the sales of receivables are reflected within Operating Activities on Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Collection fees received in connection with servicing transferred accounts receivable are included in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of money, is the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of   1.00 percent  . 
    18. COMMON STOCK 
  Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common shareholders, adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common shareholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as stock options, phantom shares and stock-based performance unit awards were exercised or settled. Duke Energy s participating securities are restricted stock units that are entitled to dividends declared on Duke Energy common shares during the restricted stock units  vesting period.

   On July 2, 2012, just prior to the close of the merger with Progress Energy, Duke Energy executed a one-for-three reverse stock split. All earnings per share amounts included in this 10-K are presented as if the one-for-three reverse stock split had been effective January 1, 2012. The following table presents Duke Energy s basic and diluted EPS calculations and reconciles the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding to the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.   

           (a) 
    Stock options and performance and unvested stock awards were not included in the dilutive securities calculation because either the option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares during those periods, or performance measures related to the awards had not yet been met. 
       19. SEVERANCE 
  In conjunction with the merger with Progress Energy, in November 2011 Duke Energy and Progress Energy offered a voluntary severance plan to certain eligible employees. Approximately   1,100   employees from Duke Energy and Progress Energy requested severance during the voluntary window, which closed on November 30, 2011. As this was a voluntary severance plan, all severance benefits offered under this plan are considered special termination benefits under U.S. GAAP. Special termination benefits are measured upon employee acceptance and recorded immediately absent any significant retention period. If a significant retention period exists, the cost of the special termination benefits are recorded ratably over the retention period. Most plan participants have separated from the company as of December 31, 2014. The amount of severance expense associated with this voluntary plan, and other severance expense for involuntary terminations related to the merger, was not material for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
  Amounts included in the table below represent direct and allocated severance and related expense recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants, and are in Operation, maintenance and other within Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.    

           (a) 
    Includes   $5 million   and   $14 million   of accelerated stock award expense and   $2 million   and   $19 million   of COBRA and health care reimbursement expenses for   2013   and   2012  , respectively.  
     In conjunction with the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3, severance benefits have been made available to certain eligible impacted unionized and non-unionized employees, to the extent that those employees do not find job opportunities at other locations. Approximately   600   employees worked at Crystal River Unit 3. For the year ended December 31,   2013  , Duke Energy Florida deferred   $26 million   of severance costs as a regulatory asset. Duke Energy Florida did not defer severance costs as a regulatory asset for the year ended December 31, 2014. Severance costs expected to be accrued over the remaining retention period for employees identified to have a significant retention period is not material. However, these employees maintain the ability to accept job opportunities at other Duke Energy locations, which would result in severance not being paid. If a significant amount of these individuals redeploy within Duke Energy, the final severance benefits paid under the plan may be less than what has been accrued to date. Refer to Note   4   for further discussion regarding Crystal River Unit 3. 
  During 2014, in conjunction with the disposition of the nonregulated Midwest Generation business, severance benefits have been made available to certain eligible non-unionized employees, to the extent those employees do not find other job opportunities. Approximately   50   employees are expected to receive benefits. Duke Energy Ohio recorded severance expense of   $6 million   and included in (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax in the Duke Energy Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended   December 31, 2014  . For further information related to the Midwest Generation Exit, see Note 2, "Acquisitions, Dispositions and Sales of Other Assets."

   Amounts included in the table below represent the severance liability for past and ongoing severance plans. Amounts for Subsidiary Registrants do not include allocated expense or associated cash payments. Amounts for Duke Energy Indiana are not material.   

  As part of Duke Energy Carolinas  2011 rate case, the NCUC approved the recovery of   $101 million   of previously recorded expenses related to a prior year Voluntary Opportunity Plan. This amount was recorded as a reduction to Operation, maintenance, and other within Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and recognized as a Regulatory asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2012. 
    20. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  Duke Energy s 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan) reserved   25 million   shares of common stock for awards to employees and outside directors. Duke Energy has historically issued new shares upon exercising or vesting of share-based awards. However, Duke Energy may use a combination of new share issuances and open market repurchases for share-based awards that are exercised or become vested in the future. Duke Energy has not determined with certainty the amount of such new share issuances or open market repurchases. 
  The 2010 Plan allows for a maximum of   6.25 million   shares of common stock to be issued under various stock-based awards other than options and stock appreciation rights. 
  In connection with the acquisition of Progress Energy in July 2012, Duke Energy assumed Progress Energy s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP). Stock-based awards granted under the Progress Energy EIP and held by Progress Energy employees were generally converted into outstanding Duke Energy stock-based compensation awards. The estimated fair value of these awards allocated to the purchase price was   $62 million  . Refer to Note   2   for further information regarding the merger transaction. 
  The following table summarizes the total expense recognized by each of the Duke Energy Registrants, net of tax, for stock-based compensation.   
   
  Pretax stock-based compensation costs, the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation expense, and stock-based compensation costs capitalized are included in the following table.

  The exercise price of each option granted cannot be less than the market price of Duke Energy s common stock on the date of grant and the maximum option term is   10 years  . The vesting periods range from immediate to three years. Options granted in 2013 and 2012 were expensed immediately; therefore, there is no future compensation cost associated with these options.  
  The following table summarizes additional information related to stock options exercised and granted.   

  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS 
  Restricted stock unit awards issued and outstanding generally vest over periods from immediate to   3 years  . Fair value amounts are based on the market price of Duke Energy's common stock at the grant date. The following table includes information related to restricted stock unit awards.   

  The following table summarizes information about restricted stock unit awards outstanding.   

  The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was   $52 million  ,   $50 million   and   $34 million  , respectively. At   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy had   $18 million   of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   one year, ten months  . 
  PERFORMANCE AWARDS 
  Stock-based awards issued and outstanding generally vest over three years if performance targets are met. 
  Certain performance awards granted in 2014, 2013 and 2012 contain market conditions based on the total shareholder return (TSR) of Duke Energy stock relative to a predefined peer group (relative TSR). These awards are valued using a path-dependent model that incorporates expected relative TSR into the fair value determination of Duke Energy s performance-based share awards. The model uses three-year historical volatilities and correlations for all companies in the predefined peer group, including Duke Energy, to simulate Duke Energy s relative TSR as of the end of the performance period. For each simulation, Duke Energy s relative TSR associated with the simulated stock price at the end of the performance period plus expected dividends within the period results in a value per share for the award portfolio. The average of these simulations is the expected portfolio value per share. Actual life to date results of Duke Energy s relative TSR for each grant is incorporated within the model.

   Other performance awards not containing market conditions were awarded in 2012. The performance goal for these awards is Duke Energy s return on equity over a three-year period. Awards are measured at grant date price. 
  The following table includes information related to performance awards.   

  The following table summarizes information about stock-based performance awards outstanding at the maximum level.   

  The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was   $27 million  ,   $42 million   and   $56 million  , respectively. At   December 31, 2014  , Duke Energy had   $21 million   of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   one year, nine months  . 
  The grant date fair value of performance awards granted in 2014 was determined based on a risk-fee interest rate of   0.7 percent  , which reflects the yield on three-year Treasury bonds as of the grant date, and an expected volatility of   13.5 percent   based on Duke Energy's historical volatility over three years using daily stock prices.  
    21. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  
  DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS 
  Duke Energy maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S. employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings based on age and/or years of service and interest credits. Certain employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula. Under these average earnings formulas, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to the sum of percentages of their (i) highest three-year or four-year average earnings, (ii) highest three-year or four-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation (maximum of   35 years  ), and/or (iii) highest three or four-year average earnings times years of participation in excess of   35 years  . Duke Energy also maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain executives. As of January 1, 2014, the qualified and non-qualified non-contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new and rehired non-union and certain unionized employees. 
  Duke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations. 
  Net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below represent the cost of the respective benefit plan for the periods presented. However, portions of the net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below have been capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. Amounts presented in the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for employees of Duke Energy s shared services affiliate that provide support to the Subsidiary Registrants. These allocated amounts are included in the governance and shared service costs discussed in Note   13  .

     Information for Plans with Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets   

  As of December 31, 2013, none of the qualified pension plans had an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets. 
  Assumptions Used for Pension Benefits Accounting 
  The discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following year s pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected. 
  The average remaining service period of active covered employees is   nine years   for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. 
  The following tables present the assumptions or range of assumptions used for pension benefit accounting.    

           (a) 
    For Progress Energy plans, the assumptions used in 2012 to determine net periodic pension costs reflect remeasurement as of July 1, 2012, due to the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy.

  Duke Energy provides, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. The health care benefits include medical, dental, and prescription drug coverage and are subject to certain limitations, such as deductibles and co-payments. 
  Duke Energy did not make any pre-funding contributions to its other post-retirement benefit plans during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   or   2012  .

     Assumptions Used for Other Post-Retirement Benefits Accounting 
  The discount rate used to determine the current year other post-retirement benefits obligation and following year s other post-retirement benefits expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.

  PLAN ASSETS 
  Description and Allocations 
  Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust 
  Assets for both the qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits are maintained in the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Approximately   98 percent   of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets were allocated to qualified pension plans and approximately   2 percent   were allocated to other post-retirement plans, as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  . The investment objective of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is to achieve reasonable returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

   The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected return. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge qualified pension plan liability. Hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments.  
  In 2013, Duke Energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. As the funded status of the qualified pension plans increases, the targeted allocation to return seeking assets will be reduced and the targeted allocation to fixed-income assets will be increased to better manage Duke Energy s qualified pension liability and reduced funded status volatility. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. 
  The Duke Energy Retirement Master Trust is authorized to engage in the lending of certain plan assets. Securities lending is an investment management enhancement that utilizes certain existing securities of the Duke Energy Retirement Master Trust to earn additional income. Securities lending involves the loaning of securities to approved parties. In return for the loaned securities, the Duke Energy Retirement Master Trust receives collateral in the form of cash as a safeguard against possible default of any borrower on the return of the loan under terms that permit the Duke Energy Retirement Master Trust to sell the securities. The Master Trust mitigates credit risk associated with securities lending arrangements by monitoring the fair value of the securities loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. The fair value of securities on loan was approximately   $383 million   and   $43 million   at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Securities lending income earned by the Master Trust was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
  Qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits for the Subsidiary Registrants are derived from the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust, as such, each are allocated their proportionate share of the assets discussed below. 
  The following table includes the target asset allocations by asset class at   December 31, 2014   and the actual asset allocations for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust.   

  VEBA I 
  Duke Energy also invests other post-retirement assets in the Duke Energy Corporation Employee Benefits Trust (VEBA I). The investment objective of VEBA I is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants. VEBA I is passively managed.  
  The following table presents target and actual asset allocations for VEBA I at   December 31, 2014  .   

  Fair Value Measurements 
  Duke Energy classifies recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements based on the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note   16  . 
  Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed above are as follows:

   Investments in equity securities 
  Investments in equity securities, other than those accounted for as equity and cost method investments, are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the reporting period. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. Prices have not been adjusted to reflect after-hours market activity. The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. When (i) the Duke Energy Registrants lack the ability to redeem investments valued on a net asset value per share basis in the near future or (ii) net asset value per share is not available at the measurement date, the fair value measurement of the investment is categorized as Level 3. 
  Investments in debt securities 
  Most debt investments are valued based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most debt valuations are Level 2 measurements. If the market for a particular fixed income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3. U.S. Treasury debt is typically Level 2. 
  Investments in short-term investment funds 
  Investments in short-term investment funds are valued at the net asset value of units held at year end. Investments in short-term investment funds with published prices are valued as Level 1. Investments in short-term investment funds with unpublished prices are valued as Level 2. 
  Investments in real estate limited partnerships 
  Investments in real estate limited partnerships are valued by the trustee at each valuation date (monthly). As part of the trustee s valuation process, properties are externally appraised generally on an annual basis, conducted by reputable, independent appraisal firms, and signed by appraisers that are members of the Appraisal Institute, with the professional designation MAI. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three valuation techniques that can be used to value investments in real estate assets: the market, income or cost approach. The appropriateness of each valuation technique depends on the type of asset or business being valued. In addition, the trustee may cause additional appraisals to be performed as warranted by specific asset or market conditions. Property valuations and the salient valuation-sensitive assumptions of each direct investment property are reviewed by the trustee quarterly and values are adjusted if there has been a significant change in circumstances related to the investment property since the last valuation. Value adjustments for interim capital expenditures are only recognized to the extent that the valuation process acknowledges a corresponding increase in fair value. An independent firm is hired to review and approve quarterly direct real estate valuations. Key inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value includes among others, rental revenue and expense amounts and related revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. Development investments are valued using cost incurred to date as a primary input until substantive progress is achieved in terms of mitigating construction and leasing risk at which point a discounted cash flow approach is more heavily weighted. Key inputs and assumptions in addition to those noted above used to determine the fair value of development investments include construction costs, and the status of construction completion and leasing. Investments in real estate limited partnerships are valued as Level 3. 
    
  Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust  
  The following tables provide the fair value measurement amounts for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust qualified pension and other post-retirement assets.   

           (a) 
    Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana were allocated approximately   28 percent  ,   31 percent  ,   15 percent  ,   16 percent  ,   5 percent   and   8 percent  , respectively, of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets at   December 31, 2014  . Accordingly, all Level 1, 2 and 3 amounts included in the table above are allocable to the Subsidiary Registrants using these percentages.

   EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS 
  Duke Energy sponsors, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, employee savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees. Most employees participate in a matching contribution formula where Duke Energy provides a matching contribution generally equal to   100 percent   of employee before-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions, and, as applicable, after-tax contributions, of up to   6 percent   of eligible pay per pay period. Dividends on Duke Energy shares held by the savings plans are charged to retained earnings when declared and shares held in the plans are considered outstanding in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. 
  As of January 1, 2014, for new and rehired non-union and certain unionized employees who are not eligible to participate in Duke Energy s defined benefit plans, an additional employer contribution of   4 percent   of eligible pay per pay period, which is subject to a three-year vesting schedule, is provided to the employee s savings plan account. 
  The following table includes pretax employer matching contributions made by Duke Energy and expensed by the Subsidiary Registrants.

    Includes a $57 million benefit as a result of the merger of two Chilean subsidiaries and a change in income tax rates in various countries primarily relating to Peru. 
     During the fourth quarter of 2014, Duke Energy declared a taxable dividend of foreign earnings in the form of notes payable that will result in the repatriation of approximately   $2.7 billion   of cash held and expected to be generated by International Energy over a period of up to   8 years  . As a result of the decision to repatriate all cumulative historical undistributed foreign earnings, during the fourth quarter of 2014, Duke Energy recorded U.S. income tax expense of approximately   $373 million  . Duke Energy s intention is to indefinitely reinvest prospective undistributed earnings generated by Duke Energy's foreign subsidiaries, and accordingly U.S. deferred taxes will not be provided for those earnings.

  DEFERRED TAXES 
  Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components   

           (a) 
    Primarily related to capital lease obligations and debt fair value adjustments. 
     On July 23, 2013, HB 998 was signed into law. HB 998 reduces the North Carolina corporate income tax rate from a statutory   6.9 percent   to   6.0 percent   in January 2014 with a further reduction to   5.0 percent   in January 2015. Duke Energy recorded a net reduction of approximately   $145 million   to its North Carolina deferred tax liability in the third quarter of 2013. The significant majority of this deferred tax liability reduction was offset by recording a regulatory liability pending NCUC determination of the disposition of the amounts related to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The impact of HB 998 did not have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy or Duke Energy Progress. 
  The following table presents the expiration of tax credits and NOL carryforwards.   

           (a) 
    A valuation allowance of   $79 million   has been recorded on the state Net Operating Loss carryforwards, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table. 
              (b) 
    A valuation allowance of   $105 million   has been recorded on the foreign Net Operating Loss carryforwards, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.

   ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE                 

None. 
    ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. 
  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   December 31, 2014  , and, based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   December 31, 2014   and have concluded no change has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. 
  Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f). The Duke Energy Registrants  internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Due to inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  management, including their Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2014   based on the framework in the Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of   December 31, 2014  . 
  Deloitte   Touche LLP, Duke Energy s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke Energy s internal control over financial reporting.

The failure of the Claiming Party to so notify the Responding Party shall not relieve the Responding Party of liability hereunder except to the extent that the defense of such Claim is prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. 
  (h)        If any proceeding is brought by a third party against a Claiming Party and the Claiming Party gives notice to the Responding Party pursuant to this   Section 10.6  , the Responding Party shall be entitled to participate in such proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of such proceeding, if (i) the Responding Party provides written notice to the Claiming Party that the Responding Party intends to undertake such defense, (ii) the Responding Party conducts the defense of the third-party Claim actively and diligently with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party and (iii) if the Responding Party is a party to the proceeding, the Responding Party or the Claiming Party has not determined in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate because of a conflict in interest.  The Claiming Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to employ separate counsel (who may be selected by the Claiming Party in its sole discretion) in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Claiming Party.  The Claiming Party shall fully cooperate with the Responding Party and its counsel in the defense or compromise of such Claim.  If the Responding Party assumes the defense of a proceeding, no compromise or settlement of such Claims may be effected by the Responding Party without the Claiming Party s consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other Claims that may be made against the Claiming Party and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Responding Party. 
  (i)        If (i) notice is given to the Responding Party of the commencement of any third-party legal proceeding and the Responding Party does not, within thirty (30) days after the Claiming Party s notice is given, give notice to the Claiming Party of its election to assume the defense of such legal proceeding, (ii) any of the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of   Section 10.6(b)   above become unsatisfied or (iii) a Claiming Party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a legal proceeding may adversely affect it other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification from the Responding Party under this Agreement, then the Claiming Party shall (upon notice to the Responding Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim;   provided  ,   however  ,     that the Responding Party shall reimburse the Claiming Party for the costs of defending against such third-party Claim (including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses) and shall remain otherwise responsible for any liability with respect to amounts arising from or related to such third-party Claim, in both cases to the extent it is ultimately determined that such Responding Party is liable with respect to such third-party Claim for a breach under this Agreement and the Claiming Party may not settle such Claim without the consent of the Responding Party not to be unreasonably withheld.  The Responding Party may elect to participate in such legal proceedings, negotiations or defense at any time at its own expense.

In furtherance of the foregoing: 
  (v)        each of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate as reasonably requested by Sellers or any Non-Company Affiliates and make readily available to and afford to Sellers, the Non-Company Affiliates and their respective Representatives reasonable access to their Representatives, properties and books and records, subject to appropriate and reasonable confidentiality agreements (  provided   that the terms of any such agreement do not restrict actions to be taken in connection with the defense of any Retained Seller Action), to the extent reasonably related to such Retained Seller Action.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to make available their Representatives for fact finding, consultation and interviews, and as witnesses to the extent that any such Person may reasonably be required in connection with any Retained Seller Action.  Access to such Persons shall be granted for reasonable periods of time during normal business hours or as otherwise mutually agreed.  The provision of access and other services pursuant to this   Section 10.7(a)(i)   shall be at no additional cost or expense of Sellers, other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expense; 
  (vi)        Sellers may, without consent of Buyer, any Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates, compromise or settle any Retained Seller Action or consent to entry of judgment with respect thereto that requires solely money damages paid by Sellers.  Any other disposition by Sellers of any Retained Seller Action shall be subject to the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and 
  (vii)        notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Sellers shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party against any attorneys  fees incurred by Buyer in connection with any Retained Seller Action unless Buyer reasonably shall have concluded (upon advice of its legal counsel) that, with respect to any Retained Seller Action, Buyer and Sellers may have different, conflicting or adverse legal positions or interests. 
  (e)        Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, cooperate with Sellers and the Non-Company Affiliates in having any Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate substituted as the named party, the costs of obtaining such substitution to be borne by Sellers or such Non-Company Affiliates.  Absent a substitution, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, cooperate and assist as is reasonably needed (to the extent requested) in satisfying any procedural requirements in connection with any Retained Seller Action, which is being defended by any Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate, including by filing papers on such Seller s or Non-Company Affiliate s behalf.  Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such substitution.  
  (f)        None of the Buyer, the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates shall intentionally take any action or omit to take any action for the purpose of interfering with or adversely affecting the rights and powers of any Seller or Non-Company Affiliate pursuant to this   Section 10.7  . 
    10.8.        Access to Information  . After the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer shall grant each other (or their respective designees), and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to grant to Sellers (or their respective designees), access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books and records relating to the Acquired Companies in their respective possession, and shall afford each such Party the right (at such Party s expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend any Claims between the Parties arising under, this Agreement.
