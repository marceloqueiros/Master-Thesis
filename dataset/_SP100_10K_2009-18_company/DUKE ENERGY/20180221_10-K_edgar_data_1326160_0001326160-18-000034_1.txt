CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
  This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on management s beliefs and assumptions and can often be identified by terms and phrases that include  anticipate,   believe,   intend,   estimate,   expect,   continue,   should,   could,   may,   plan,   project,   predict,   will,   potential,   forecast,   target,   guidance,   outlook  or other similar terminology. Various factors may cause actual results to be materially different than the suggested outcomes within forward-looking statements; accordingly, there is no assurance that such results will be realized. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
             
    State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements, including those related to climate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or market prices; 
                
    The extent and timing of costs and liabilities to comply with federal and state laws, regulations and legal requirements related to coal ash remediation, including amounts for required closure of certain ash impoundments, are uncertain and difficult to estimate; 
                
    The ability to recover eligible costs, including amounts associated with coal ash impoundment retirement obligations and costs related to significant weather events, and to earn an adequate return on investment through rate case proceedings and the regulatory process; 
                
    The costs of decommissioning Crystal River Unit 3 and other nuclear facilities could prove to be more extensive than amounts estimated and all costs may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process; 
                
    Costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; 
                
    Industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in service territories or customer bases resulting from sustained downturns of the economy and the economic health of our service territories or variations in customer usage patterns, including energy efficiency efforts and use of alternative energy sources, such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies; 
                
    Federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in customers leaving the electric distribution system, excess generation resources as well as stranded costs; 
                
    Advancements in technology; 
                
    Additional competition in electric and natural gas markets and continued industry consolidation; 
                
    The influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic, operational and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and tornadoes, including extreme weather associated with climate change; 
                
    The ability to successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to customers including direct or indirect effects to the company resulting from an incident that affects the U.S. electric grid or generating resources; 
                
    The ability to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure projects in our natural gas business;  
                
    Operational interruptions to our natural gas distribution and transmission activities; 
                
    The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply; 
                
    The impact on facilities and business from a terrorist attack, cybersecurity threats, data security breaches and other catastrophic events, such as fires, explosions, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences; 
                
    The inherent risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities, including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks, including the financial stability of third-party service providers; 
                
    The timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and interest rates and the ability to recover such costs through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets; 
                
    The results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations, compliance with debt covenants and conditions and general market and economic conditions; 
                
    Credit ratings of the Duke Energy Registrants may be different from what is expected; 
                
    Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed-income securities and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; 
                
    Construction and development risks associated with the completion of the Duke Energy Registrants  capital investment projects, including risks related to financing, obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to recover costs from customers in a timely manner, or at all; 
                
    Changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, including changes in rate designs and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks related to obligations created by the default of other participants;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

DUKE ENERGY                 

General 
  Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) was incorporated on May 3, 2005, and is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Duke Energy operates in the United States (U.S.) primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also subsidiary registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas); Progress Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy); Duke Energy Progress, LLC (Duke Energy Progress); Duke Energy Florida, LLC (Duke Energy Florida); Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio); Duke Energy Indiana, LLC (Duke Energy Indiana) and Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont). When discussing Duke Energy s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its separate subsidiary registrants (collectively referred to as the Subsidiary Registrants), which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  Piedmont, a North Carolina corporation, is an energy services company whose principal business is the distribution of natural gas to over 1 million residential, commercial, industrial and power generation customers in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, including customers served by municipalities who are Piedmont's sales for resale customers. In October 2016, Duke Energy completed the acquisition of Piedmont. Piedmont's earnings and cash flows are only included in Duke Energy's consolidated results subsequent to the acquisition date. See Note   2   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information regarding the acquisition.  
  In December 2016, Duke Energy completed an exit of the Latin American market to focus on its domestic regulated business, which was further bolstered by the acquisition of Piedmont. The sale of the International Energy business segment, excluding an equity method investment in National Methanol Company (NMC), was completed through two transactions including a sale of assets in Brazil to China Three Gorges (Luxembourg) Energy S. .r.l. (CTG) and a sale of Duke Energy's remaining Latin American assets in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina to ISQ Enerlam Aggregator, L.P. and Enerlam (UK) Holding Ltd. (I Squared) (collectively, the International Disposal Group). See Note   2   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information on the sale of International Energy.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants electronically file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxies and amendments to such reports. 
  The public may read and copy any materials the Duke Energy Registrants file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Additionally, information about the Duke Energy Registrants, including reports filed with the SEC, is available through Duke Energy s website at http://www.duke-energy.com. Such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC. 
   
  Business Segments 
  Duke Energy's segment structure includes three reportable operating segments (business segments); Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy s operations is presented as Other. Duke Energy's chief operating decision-maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note   3   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Business Segments.  The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy s business segments, as well as Other. 
  ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure provides retail electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately   7.6 million   customers within the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The service territory is approximately   95,000   square miles across six states with a total estimated population of   24 million   people. The operations include electricity sold wholesale to municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is also a joint owner in certain electric transmission projects. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has a   50 percent   ownership interest in Duke-American Transmission Co. (DATC), a partnership with American Transmission Company, formed to design, build and operate transmission infrastructure. DATC owns   72 percent   of the transmission service rights to Path 15, an 84-mile transmission line in central California. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure also has a   50 percent   ownership interest in Pioneer Transmission, LLC, which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North America. 
  
   9 

PART I 

The electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) and the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC). 
  The following table represents the distribution of billed sales by customer class for the year ended   December 31, 2017  .   

  The number of residential and general service customers within the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time. While economic conditions within the service territory continue to improve, sales growth has been hampered by continued adoption of energy efficiencies and self-generation. The continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances is expected to have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time. While residential sales increased in   2017   compared to   2016  , the growth rate was modest when compared to historical periods. 
  Seasonality and the Impact of Weather 
  Revenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Residential and general service customers are more impacted by weather than industrial customers. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions. 
  The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers  historic usage patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods. 
  Heating-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating-degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling-degree day. 
  Competition 
  Retail 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to transmit and distribute electricity and, except in Ohio, to generate electricity. Services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices.  
  Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including on-site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation, such as private solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites. 
  Duke Energy is not aware of any proposed legislation within any of its jurisdictions that would provide retail customers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry, including broadly subsidizing distributed generation such as private solar. 
  Although there is no pending legislation at this time, if the retail jurisdictions served by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure become subject to deregulation, the recovery of stranded costs could become a significant consideration. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power commitments from qualifying facilities (QFs). The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) established a new class of generating facilities as QFs, typically small power production facilities that generate power within a utility company s service territory for which the utility companies are legally obligated to purchase the energy at an avoided cost rate. Thus far, all states that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to recover a substantial portion of stranded costs. 
  
   10 

PART I 

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s largest stranded cost exposure is primarily related to Duke Energy Florida s purchased power commitments with QFs, under which it has future minimum expected capacity payments through 2043 of $  2.4 billion  . Duke Energy Florida was obligated to enter into these contracts under provisions of PURPA. Duke Energy Florida continues to seek ways to address the impact of escalating payments under these contracts. However, the FPSC allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from QFs. For additional information related to these purchased power commitments, see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.   
  In Ohio, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity and not on the cost of the underlying energy. 
  Wholesale 
  Duke Energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale transactions under primarily cost-based contracts approved by FERC. The principal factors in competing for these sales are price, availability of capacity and power and reliability of service. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs. 
  Increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. 
  Energy Capacity and Resources 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure owns approximately   49,506   megawatts (MW) of generation capacity. For additional information on owned generation facilities, see Item 2,  Properties.  
    
  Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to purchase power for its customers may include, but are not limited to, generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, demand growth and price. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply. 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements. 
  Potential Plant Retirements 
  The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. Recent IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their current estimated useful lives, primarily because these facilities do not have the requisite emission control equipment to meet United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations recently approved or proposed. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these assets are retired. For additional information related to potential plant retirements, see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters.  
  On October 23, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register the final Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule that regulates carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs). The CPP establishes CO   2    emission rates and mass cap goals that apply to existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs. Petitions challenging the rule were filed by several groups and on February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a stay of the final CPP rule, halting implementation of the CPP until legal challenges are resolved. States in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate have suspended work on the CPP in response to the stay. Oral arguments before 10 of the 11 judges on D.C. Circuit Court were heard on September 27, 2016. The court has not issued its opinion in the case.  
  On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing EPA to review the CPP and determine whether to suspend, revise or rescind the rule. On the same day, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a motion with the D.C. Circuit Court requesting that the court stay the litigation of the rule while it is reviewed by EPA. On April 28, 2017, the court issued an order to suspend the litigation for 60 days. On August 8, 2017, the court, on its own motion, extended the suspension of the litigation for an additional 60 days. On October 16, 2017, EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) to repeal the CPP based on a change to EPA s legal interpretation of the section of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on which the CPP was based. In the proposal, EPA indicates that it has not determined whether it will issue a rule to replace the CPP, and if it will do so, when and what form that rule will take. The comment period on EPA's NPR ends April 26, 2018. On December 28, 2017 EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in which it seeks public comment on various aspects of a potential CPP replacement rule. The comment period on the ANPRM ends February 26, 2018. If EPA decides to move forward with a CPP replacement rule, it will need to issue a formal proposal for public comment. Litigation of the CPP remains on hold in the D.C. Circuit and the February 2016 U.S. Supreme Court stay of the CPP remains in effect.

PART I 

Should the CPP be upheld, compliance could cause the industry to replace coal-fired generation with natural gas and renewables. Costs to operate coal-fired generation plants continue to grow due to increasing environmental compliance requirements, including ash management costs unrelated to CPP, which may result in the retirement of coal-fired generation plants earlier than the current end of useful lives. The Duke Energy Registrants could incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance and other costs for replacement generation as a result of this rule. Due to the uncertainties related to the implementation of the CPP, the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 
  Sources of Electricity 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure relies principally on coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended   December 31, 2017  .   

           (a) 
    Statistics related to all fuels reflect Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities.  
              (b) 
    Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped storage facilities during off-peak periods.  
     Coal 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range from   2018 to 2020   for Duke Energy Carolinas,   2018 to 2020   for Duke Energy Progress,   2018 to 2020   for Duke Energy Florida,   2018 to 2020   for Duke Energy Ohio and   2018 to 2025   for Duke Energy Indiana. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its hedging guidelines regarding projected future consumption. As a result of volatility in natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch within the generation fleet, coal inventories will continue to fluctuate. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure continues to actively manage its portfolio and has worked with suppliers to obtain increased flexibility in its coal contracts.  
  Coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in Colorado and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Kentucky is delivered by barge and is produced from mines along the Ohio River in Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is between   1.5 percent   and   2 percent   for Duke Energy Carolinas, between   1.5 percent   and   2 percent   for Duke Energy Progress, between   1 percent   and   3 percent   for Duke Energy Florida, between   3 percent   and   3.5 percent   for Duke Energy Ohio and between   2.5 percent   and   3 percent   for Duke Energy Indiana. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO   2   ) emission allowances, enable Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to satisfy current SO   2    emission limitations for its existing facilities. 
  Nuclear 
  The industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates and services to convert, enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies. 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure generally sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear contracts. 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100 percent of its uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services requirements through at least 2018 and cover fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2027. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services. 
  
   12 

PART I 

Natural Gas and Fuel Oil 
  Natural gas and fuel oil supply, transportation and storage for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s generation fleet is purchased under standard industry agreements from various suppliers, including Piedmont. Natural gas supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns being procured over time, with varied expiration dates. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future. 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has certain dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil. The cost of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry publications, plus any transportation and freight costs. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. For Duke Energy Florida, there is currently an agreed to moratorium on future hedging with the Florida Public Service Commission.  
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has firm interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place to support generation needed for load requirements. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure may purchase additional shorter-term natural gas transportation and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support generation needed for load requirements. The Electric Utilities and Infrastructure natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines. 
  Purchased Power 
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure purchases a portion of its capacity and system requirements through purchase obligations, leases and purchase capacity contracts. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it can obtain adequate purchased power capacity to meet future system load needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected. 
  The following table summarizes purchased power for the previous three years: 

(b)    These agreements include approximately 451 MW of firm capacity under contract by Duke Energy Florida with QFs. 
  Inventory 
  Generation of electricity is capital intensive. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of   December 31, 2017  , the inventory balance for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was approximately   $3.1 billion  . For additional information on inventory, see Note   1   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  
  Ash Basin Management 
  The North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) regulates the handling of coal ash within the state and requires closure of ash impoundments by no later than December 31, 2029, based on risk rankings, among other detailed requirements. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. These plans and all associated permits must be approved before any work can begin. 
  On April 17, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule to regulate the disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) from electric utilities as solid waste. The rule classifies CCR as nonhazardous under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The EPA CCR rule has certain requirements, which if not met could initiate impoundment closure and require closure completion within five years. The EPA CCR rule includes extension requirements, which if met could allow the extension of closure completion by up to 10 years. The RCRA and the Coal Ash Act finalized the legal framework related to coal ash management practices and ash basin closure.  
  Duke Energy has advanced the strategy and implementation for the remediation or closure of coal ash basins. In 2015, Duke Energy began activities at certain North Carolina sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act, including moving coal ash off-site for use in structural fill or to lined landfills. Additional modifications to operating coal plants are underway to comply with the Coal Ash Act and RCRA. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have included compliance costs associated with the EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act in their respective rate case filings. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress  wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to asset retirement obligations for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Notes   4  ,   5   and   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," "Commitments and Contingencies" and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively.

PART I 

Nuclear Matters 
  Duke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Plant (Crystal River Unit 3) permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately   $13.4 billion  . For additional information on nuclear insurance see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.  
  Duke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Duke Energy to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years. 
  The following table summarizes the fair value of nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) balances and cost study results for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. Decommissioning costs in the table below are stated in 2013 or 2014 dollars, depending the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.   

  (a)    Amounts for Progress Energy equal the sum of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. 
           (b) 
    Amounts include the Subsidiary Registrants' ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors. 
              (c) 
    Duke Energy Florida received reimbursements from the NDTF for costs related to ongoing decommissioning activity of Crystal River Unit 3. 
     The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC have allowed Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail and wholesale rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balances and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. For additional information, see Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations.  
  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) (NWPA) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The government has not yet developed a storage facility or disposal capacity, so Electric Utilities and Infrastructure will continue to store spent fuel on its reactor sites. 
  Under federal law, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE terminated the project to license and develop a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada in 2010, and is currently taking no action to fulfill its responsibilities to dispose of spent fuel.  
  Until the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. Under current regulatory guidelines, Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant (Harris) has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. Crystal River Unit 3 ceased operation in 2013 and was placed in a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018. As of January 2018, all spent fuel at Crystal River Unit 3 has been transferred from the spent fuel pool to dry storage at an on-site independent spent fuel storage installation where it will be stored until the DOE removes it. With certain modifications and approvals by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expand the on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel dry storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space of spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for the Brunswick Nuclear Plant (Brunswick), Catawba Nuclear Station (Catawba), McGuire Nuclear Station (McGuire), Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee) and Robinson Nuclear Plant (Robinson). 
  The nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction.  
  
   14 

PART I 

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current year of expiration of nuclear operating licenses for nuclear stations in operation. Nuclear operating licenses are potentially subject to extension.    

  The NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. For additional information on decommissioning activity, see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters." 
  On October 27, 2016, and December 15, 2016, the NRC issued combined operating licenses for Duke Energy Florida's proposed Levy Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (Levy) and Duke Energy Carolinas' William States Lee III Nuclear Station Units 1 and 2, respectively. On August 25, 2017, as part of Duke Energy Carolinas rate case filing, Duke Energy Carolinas requested NCUC approval to cancel the development of the Lee Nuclear Station project with the intent to maintain the combined operating licenses. On August 29, 2017, Duke Energy announced the complete abandonment of the Levy project with the intent to terminate the combined operating licenses. For additional information on these proposed nuclear plants, see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters." 
  Regulation 
  State 
  The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, PUCO, IURC and KPSC (collectively, the state electric utility commissions) approve rates for Duke Energy's retail electric service within their respective states. The state electric utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s generating facilities. Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity issued by the state electric utility commissions, as applicable, authorize Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to construct and operate its electric facilities and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state electric utility commission is required for the entities within Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity. 
  In addition to rates approved in base rate cases, each of the state electric utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost-recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent.  
  Fuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, renewable generation and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.

  Federal 
  The FERC approves Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s cost-based rates for electric sales to certain power and transmission wholesale customers. Regulations of FERC and the state electric utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Electric Utilities and Infrastructure. 
  Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO).   PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) are the Independent System Operators (ISO) and FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and control the day-to-day operations of bulk power systems through central dispatch. 
  Duke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control of their transmission facilities and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on a regionwide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO members at rates based on the costs of transmission service. 
  Environmental.   Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see  Environmental Matters  in this section. See  Other Matters  section of MD A for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy s operations. 
   
  GAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE  
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure conducts natural gas operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio. The natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, Tennessee Public Utility Commission (TPUC), Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and the FERC. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure serves residential, commercial, industrial and power generation natural gas customers. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has over   1.5 million   customers, including more than   1 million   customers located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and an additional   526,000   customers located within southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. In the Carolinas, Ohio and Kentucky, the service areas are comprised of numerous cities, towns and communities. In Tennessee, the service area is the metropolitan area of Nashville.  
  The number of residential, commercial and industrial customers within the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or decline for the foreseeable future, however decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability. While total industrial and general service sales increased in   2017   when compared to   2016  , the growth rate was modest when compared to historical periods. 
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure also owns, operates and has investments in various pipeline transmission and natural gas storage facilities.  
  
   16 

PART I 

Natural Gas for Retail Distribution 
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure is responsible for the distribution of natural gas to retail customers in its North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky service territories. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure s natural gas procurement strategy is to contract primarily with major and independent producers and marketers for natural gas supply. It also purchases a diverse portfolio of transportation and storage service from interstate pipelines. This strategy allows Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to assure reliable natural gas supply and transportation for its firm customers during peak winter conditions. When firm pipeline services or contracted natural gas supplies are temporarily not needed due to market demand fluctuations, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure may release these services and supplies in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or make wholesale secondary market sales. In   2017  , firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided   100 percent   of the natural gas supply for Piedmont and   100 percent   for Duke Energy Ohio. 
  Seasonality and the Impact of Weather 
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns due to peak natural gas sales occurring during the winter months. Residential customers are the most impacted by weather. There are certain regulatory mechanisms for the North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee service territories that normalize the margins collected from certain customer classes during the winter, providing for an adjustment either up or down. In North Carolina, rate design provides protection from both weather and other usage variations such as conservation. In South Carolina and Tennessee, revenues are adjusted solely based on weather during the periods of November through March and October through April, respectively. Rate design for the Ohio service territory also mitigates the impacts of weather on customer bills. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions. 
  Degree-day data are used to estimate energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures based on each day s average temperature. Heating-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. The methodology used to estimate the applicable impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions, such as wind chill. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods. 
  Competition 
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure s businesses operate as the sole supplier of natural gas within their retail service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive natural gas supply market for distribution service. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices.  
  In residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs.  
  Higher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business, adversely affecting our earnings.  
  Pipeline and Storage Investments 
  Duke Energy, through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, is a   47 percent   equity member of Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC (ACP) that plans to build and own the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP Pipeline), an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline, regulated by FERC. Prior to the Piedmont acquisition, Duke Energy owned a 40 percent equity ownership in ACP. The ACP pipeline is intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont, among others, will be customers of the ACP pipeline. The targeted in-service date of the pipeline is late 2019.  
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure also has a   7.5 percent   equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail). Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns a 515-mile natural gas pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to transport natural gas to Florida, regulated by FERC. The Sabal Trail phase one mainline was placed into service in July 2017 and traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. A request to place in-service a lateral line to the Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County Combined Cycle facility is pending with FERC. Current legal challenges to the Sabal Trail pipeline are ongoing, which may have an impact on continuing operations of the pipeline.  
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 24 percent equity ownership interest in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution), an interstate pipeline development company formed to develop, construct, own and operate a 124-mile natural gas pipeline and related facilities connecting shale natural gas supplies and gathering systems in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, to Iroquois Gas Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in New York, regulated by FERC. As a result of permitting delays and project uncertainty, Constitution is unable to approximate an in-service date. 
  
   17 

PART I 

As a result of the Piedmont acquisition, Duke Energy, through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, has a   21.49 percent   equity ownership interest in Cardinal Pipeline Company, LLC (Cardinal), an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a   45 percent   equity ownership in Pine Needle LNG Company, LLC (Pine Needle), an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a   50 percent   equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage Company, LLC (Hardy Storage), an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC. 
  KO Transmission Company (KO Transmission), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, is an interstate pipeline company engaged in the business of transporting natural gas and is subject to the rules and regulations of FERC. KO Transmission's 90-mile pipeline supplies natural gas to Duke Energy Ohio and interconnects with the Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. An approximately 70-mile portion of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities is co-owned by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation.  
  See Notes   4  ,   12   and   17   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates" and "Variable Interest Entities," respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's pipeline investments.  
  Inventory 
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of   December 31, 2017  , the inventory balance for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure was   $106 million  . For more information on inventory, see Note   1   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." 
  Regulation 
  State 
  The NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, TPUC and KPSC (collectively, the state gas utility commissions) approve rates for Duke Energy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. The state gas utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure s natural gas distribution facilities. Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity or Certificates of Environmental Compatibility and Public Necessity issued by the state gas utility commissions or other government agencies, as applicable, authorize Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state gas utility commission is required for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity. 
  In addition to amounts collected from customers though approved base rates, each of the state gas utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost-recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent.  
  Natural gas costs are eligible for recovery by Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have not been prudent. However, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. 
  The following table summarizes certain components underlying recently approved and effective base rates or rate stabilization filings in the last three years.   

           (a) 
    Under the rate stabilization adjustment mechanism, Piedmont resets rates in South Carolina based on updated costs and revenues on an annual basis.  
     Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has integrity management rider (IMR) mechanisms in North Carolina and Tennessee designed to separately track and recover certain costs associated with capital investments incurred to comply with federal pipeline safety and integrity programs, as well as additional state safety and integrity requirements in Tennessee. The following table summarizes information related to recently approved or pending IMR filings.

  COMMERCIAL RENEWABLES 
  Commercial Renewables primarily acquires, builds, develops and operates wind and solar renewable generation throughout the continental U.S. The portfolio includes nonregulated renewable energy and energy storage businesses.  
  Commercial Renewables' renewable energy includes utility-scale wind and solar generation assets, which total   2,907   MW across 14 states from 21 wind facilities and 63 solar facilities. Revenues are primarily generated by selling the power produced from renewable generation through long-term contracts to utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities and commercial and industrial customers. In most instances, these customers have obligations under state-mandated renewable energy portfolio standards or similar state or local renewable energy goals. Energy and renewable energy credits generated by wind and solar projects are generally sold at contractual prices. In addition, as eligible wind and solar projects are placed in service, Commercial Renewables recognizes either investment tax credits (ITCs) when the renewable solar or wind project achieves commercial availability or production tax credits (PTC) as power is generated by wind projects over 10 years. Renewable ITCs are recognized over the useful life of the asset as a reduction to depreciation expense with the benefit of the tax basis adjustment due to the ITC recognized in income in the year of commercial availability. 
  As part of its growth strategy, Commercial Renewables has expanded its investment portfolio through the addition of distributed solar companies and projects, energy storage systems and energy management solutions specifically tailored to commercial businesses. These investments include the 2015 acquisition of a controlling interest in REC Solar Corp., a California-based provider of solar installations for retail, manufacturing, agriculture, technology, government and nonprofit customers across the U.S. and Phoenix Energy Technologies Inc., a California-based provider of enterprise energy management and information software to commercial businesses. In 2017, Duke Energy acquired the remaining interest in REC Solar.  
  For additional information on Commercial Renewables' generation facilities, see Item 2,  Properties.  
  Regulation 
  Commercial Renewables is subject to regulation at the federal level, primarily from the FERC. Regulations of the FERC govern access to regulated market information by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated utilities. 
  Market Environment and Competition 
  The market price of commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services provided, drive competition in the wholesale energy business. Commercial Renewables' main competitors include other nonregulated generators and wholesale power providers. 
  Sources of Electricity 
  Commercial Renewables relies on wind and solar resources for its generation of electric energy.

PART I 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS                 

In addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Matters Impacting Future Results" for each registrant in Item 7, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy. 
  Business Strategy Risks 
  Duke Energy s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy. 
  Duke Energy s future results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. Duke Energy's strategy, including transforming the customer experience, modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy, expansion of natural gas infrastructure, modernizing the regulatory construct and engaging employees and stakeholders to accomplish these priorities, is subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control. As a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its strategy. 
  Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  regulated utility revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions, retail electric and natural gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants  future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants  future earnings could be negatively impacted. 
  If legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy Registrants  exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded, their future earnings could be negatively impacted. Federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in customers leaving the electric distribution system and an increase in customer net energy metering, which allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail amount. Over time, customer adoption of these technologies and increased energy efficiency could result in excess generation resources as well as stranded costs if Duke Energy is not able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation.  
  State regulators have approved various mechanisms to stabilize natural gas utility margins, including margin decoupling in North Carolina, rate stabilization in South Carolina and uncollectible natural gas cost recovery in all states. State regulators have approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms that, for example, allow for recovery of margin losses associated with negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline. If regulators decided to discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants' use of tariff mechanisms, it would negatively impact results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are prudent and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the Duke Energy Registrants seek to recover from customers, which would adversely impact earnings. 
  The rates that the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge are established by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings, which may limit their ability to recover costs and earn an appropriate return on investment.  
  The rates that the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated utility business are allowed to charge significantly influences the results of operations, financial position and liquidity of the Duke Energy Registrants. The regulation of the rates that the regulated utility businesses charge customers is determined, in large part, by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings. Negative decisions made by these regulators could have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations, financial position or liquidity and affect the ability of the Duke Energy Registrants to recover costs and an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investments being made. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of these rate case proceedings. 
  Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations or cash flows and their utility businesses. 
  Increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Retail competition and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have a significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  
   23 

PART I 

The Duke Energy Registrants  businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies, including taxes, that may change over time in ways that affect operations and costs. 
  Duke Energy is subject to regulations under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that result in material modifications of business models and objectives or affect returns on investment by restricting activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. 
  On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (the Tax Act) into law which, among other provisions, reduces the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and limits interest deductions outside of regulated utility operations effective January 1, 2018. The resulting revaluation of existing deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal corporate tax rate were recognized in Duke Energy s December 31, 2017, financial statements. Guidance issued by the SEC indicates that additional adjustments for items that were estimated may be recorded during 2018 if new information becomes available. The Tax Act also could be amended or subject to technical correction, which could change the financial impacts that were recorded at December 31, 2017, or are expected to be recorded in future periods. The FERC and state utility commissions will determine the regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Act. Duke Energy s future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the Tax Act, subsequent amendments or corrections, or the actions of the FERC, state utility commissions or credit rating agencies related to the Tax Act. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulation by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other federal agencies as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the future course of regulatory changes or the ultimate effect those changes will have on their businesses. However, changes in regulation can cause delays in or affect business planning and transactions and can substantially increase the Duke Energy Registrants  costs. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including CCRs, air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to regulatory cost recovery, the Duke Energy Registrants are at risk that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will have such an effect. 
  The EPA has recently enacted or proposed new federal regulations governing the management of cooling water intake structures, wastewater and CO   2    emissions. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants' operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change. 
  There is continued concern, both nationally and internationally, about climate change. The EPA may adopt and implement regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs. Increased regulation of GHG emissions could impose significant additional costs on the Duke Energy Registrants' operations, their suppliers and customers. Regulatory changes could also result in generation facilities to be retired early and result in stranded costs if Duke Energy is not able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation. At this time, the effect that climate change regulation may have in the future on Duke Energy's business, financial condition or results of operations is not able to be predicted.

PART I 

Operational Risks 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control. 
  Sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence operations. Declines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of economic downturns in the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas. Although the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could reduce the Duke Energy Registrants  revenues and margins, thereby diminishing results of operations. 
  Factors that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows: 
             
    weather conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes, as applicable, and periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner; 
                
    supply of and demand for energy commodities; 
                
    transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies that impact nonregulated energy operations; 
                
    availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or natural gas plants, and customer usage of energy-efficient equipment that reduces energy demand; 
                
    natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices; 
                
    ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, such as coal, natural gas and uranium; and 
                
    capacity and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants  markets. 
     Natural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  operating results. 
  Natural disasters (such as electromagnetic events or the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan) or other operational accidents within the company or industry (such as the San Bruno, California natural gas transmission pipeline failure) could have direct significant impacts on the Duke Energy Registrants as well as on key contractors and suppliers. Such events could indirectly impact the Duke Energy Registrants through changes to policies, laws and regulations whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  The reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with federal and state regulations, laws, and other legal requirements that govern the operations, assessments, storage, closure, remediation, disposal and monitoring relating to CCR, the high costs and new rate impacts associated with implementing these new CCR-related requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations. 
  As a result of electricity produced for decades at coal-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCR that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in other surface impoundments, all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, the potential exists for another CCR-related incident, such as the one that occurred during the 2014 Dan River Steam Station ash basin release, that could raise environmental or general public health concerns. Such a CCR-related incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants.  
  During 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments, structural fills and CCR piles, and establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be independently regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future. These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, increased operating and maintenance costs and/or result in closure of certain power generating facilities, which could affect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In addition, the timing for recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows. 
  
   25 

PART I 

The Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant asset retirement obligations related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of large amounts of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. At other sites, preliminary planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs. The Coal Ash Act requires CCR surface impoundments in North Carolina to be closed, with the closure method and timing based on a risk ranking classification determined by legislation or state regulators. Additionally, the RCRA required closure timing depends upon meeting or continuing to meet certain criteria. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers. 
  Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. 
  Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. 
  Advances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Furthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change. 
  Electric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal businesses. In most parts of the U.S., the demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Demand for natural gas peaks during the winter months. Further, extreme weather conditions such as heat waves, winter storms and severe weather associated with climate change could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period comparison less relevant. 
  Sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages, property damage, including downed transmission and distribution lines, and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market. The FERC s power transmission regulations require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered. 
  The different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants  wholesale power marketing business. 
  
   26 

PART I 

Duke Energy may be unable to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure development or maintenance projects, which may delay or prevent the Duke Energy Registrants from serving natural gas customers or expanding the natural gas business. 
  In order to serve current or new natural gas customers or expand the service to existing customers, the Duke Energy Registrants need to maintain, expand or upgrade distribution, transmission and/or storage infrastructure, including laying new pipeline and building compressor stations. Duke Energy Registrants have made significant investments in a number of pipeline development projects, which are being operated and constructed by third party joint venture partners. Various factors, such as the inability to obtain required approval from local, state and/or federal regulatory and governmental bodies, public opposition to projects, inability to obtain adequate financing, competition for labor and materials, construction delays, cost overruns and the inability to negotiate acceptable agreements relating to rights of way, construction or other material development components, may prevent or delay the completion of projects or increase costs. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be unable to adequately serve existing natural gas customers or support customer growth or could incur higher than anticipated costs, which could have a negative financial impact. 
  The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable service territories. Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to the Duke Energy Registrants' systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of their core markets. A significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyberattacks or other acts of war or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections, could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings. Moreover, if additional natural gas infrastructure, including, but not limited to, exploration and drilling rigs and platforms, processing and gathering systems, off-shore pipelines, interstate pipelines and storage, cannot be built at a pace that meets demand, then growth opportunities could be limited and earnings negatively impacted. 
  Fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants  operations as well as their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost-recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions. 
  Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the Duke Energy Registrants' ability to operate their facilities. Should counterparties fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. 
  Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants  hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, derivative collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily derivative position. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants  credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity. 
  Potential terrorist activities, or military or other actions, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses. 
  The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. Information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups. The potential for terrorism has subjected the Duke Energy Registrants  operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC s design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. 
  Cyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses.  
  Information security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. The utility industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the internet continues to increase through smart grid and other initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the internet and technology systems  inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy Registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattack. In the event of such an attack, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, property damaged, customer information stolen and other private information accessed, (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. 
  
   27 

PART I 

Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations. 
  Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected. 
  The costs of retiring Duke Energy Florida s Crystal River Unit 3 could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified. 
  Costs to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimates and, if not recoverable through the regulatory process, could adversely affect Duke Energy s, Progress Energy s and Duke Energy Florida s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s membership in an RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
  The rules governing the various regional power markets may change, which could affect Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s costs and/or revenues. To the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. While RTO transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral, various proposals and proceedings currently taking place by the FERC may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. In addition, RTOs have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. 
  As members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled.  
  Duke Energy s long-term strategy requires the construction of new projects, either wholly owned or partially owned, which involve a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of these construction projects, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled. 
  Nuclear Generation Risks 
  Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities. 
  Ownership interest in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. 
  Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down a unit depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  
   28 

PART I 

Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks 
  The Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term debt and equity markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants  control. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  businesses are significantly financed through issuances of debt and equity. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity may limit the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth. 
  Market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, unfavorable capital market conditions, market prices for electricity and natural gas, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energy s Master Credit Facility depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement. 
  Duke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the Master Credit Facility. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity. 
  Each of the Duke Energy Registrants  senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the future. 
  If the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited.  
  A downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants  liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Non-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to execute future borrowings. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. 
  Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding. 
  Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected. 
  
   29 

PART I 

Poor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants  liquidity and results of operations. 
  The costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants  proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
  Duke Energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations. 
  Because Duke Energy is a holding company with no operations or cash flows of its own, its ability to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock, is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Duke Energy, its subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Duke Energy with funds. In addition, Duke Energy may provide capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on Duke Energy s common stock.

PART II 

2017   Areas of Focus and Accomplishments 
  Duke Energy advanced a number of important strategic initiatives to transform its energy future with a focus on customers, employees, operations and growth. The company has responded to an environment of changing customer demands by investing in electric and natural gas infrastructure that customers value and that provide an opportunity for sustainable growth.  
  Portfolio Transition.   On October 3, 2016, Duke Energy completed the acquisition of Piedmont, a North Carolina corporation primarily engaged in regulated natural gas distribution to residential, commercial, industrial and power generation customers in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. In December 2016, Duke Energy completed the sale of its Latin American generation businesses in two separate transactions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information regarding these transactions. 
  With the acquisition of Piedmont and the sale of International Energy, Duke Energy completed a multiyear portfolio transition. The Piedmont acquisition reflects the growing importance of natural gas to the future of the energy infrastructure within the company's service territory and throughout the U.S. and establishes a strategic platform for future growth in natural gas infrastructure. The growth opportunities reflected in our 10-year strategy are expected to increase the earnings contributions from the natural gas business from 8 percent to 15 percent.  
  Operational Excellence  .   Duke Energy continues to focus on the safe and efficient operation of its generation fleet. During 2017, we delivered strong overall safety and environmental performance, with our key employee safety metric, total incident case rate, and our reportable environmental events both improving from last year. Our nuclear and fossil/hydro generation fleets demonstrated strong performance, exceeding their respective reliability targets. 
  Storm Response and System Restoration  .   Hurricane Irma, in October 2017, was one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the southern U.S. During Hurricane Irma, over 1.3 million customers in Florida were without power.   O  ur restoration efforts involved coordination and communication with more than 12,000 line and fieldworkers and our team restored power to 99 percent of customers within eight days. 
  Customer Satisfaction  .   Higher J.D. Power residential customer satisfaction scores in 2017 reflect progress in the company's efforts to meet customers  expectations. The work to improve customer satisfaction will continue, but all jurisdictions remain on track to make steady gains in the years ahead as Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through its Customer Connect Program. 
  Constructive Regulatory Outcomes  . One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in all of our jurisdictions within 10 years. Modernized constructs provide a number of benefits, including improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. We filed several base rate cases during 2017 to recover a range of strategic investments, such as customer service technologies, coal ash costs in the Carolinas, smart meters, natural gas and solar generation. We continue to pursue additional legislative and regulatory outcomes, both in Washington and across our service territories, that make sense for our customers and investors. 
  Cost Management and Efficiencies  .   Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity, including merger integration and continuous improvement efforts. These efficiencies will help in Duke Energy's objective to keep overall customer rates below the national average, while moderating customer bill increases over time. We are on track to exceed targeted Piedmont merger cost synergies without significant disruptions to the business or culture, integrating the Piedmont and Midwest natural gas operations, and moving to a shared services model. We continue to leverage new technology and data analytics to drive additional efficiencies across the business. 
  Dividend Growth  .   In 2017, Duke Energy continued to grow the dividend payment to shareholders by approximately 4 percent. 2017 represented the 91st consecutive year Duke Energy paid a cash dividend on its common stock. 
  Duke Energy Objectives   2018 and Beyond 
  Duke Energy will continue to deliver exceptional value to customers, be an integral part of the communities in which it does business, and provide attractive returns to investors. Duke Energy is committed to lead the way to cleaner, smarter energy solutions that customers value through a strategy focused on: 
             
    Transformation of the customer experience to meet changing customer expectations through enhanced convenience, control and choice in energy supply and usage. 
                
    Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather and to improve the system's reliability and flexibility, as well as to provide better information and services for customers. 
                
    Generation of cleaner energy through an increased amount of natural gas, renewables generation and the continued safe and reliable operation of nuclear plants. 
                
    Expansion of natural gas infrastructure, from midstream gas pipelines to local distribution systems. 
                
    Operational excellence through engagement with employees and being an industry leader in safety performance and efficient operations.  
                
    Stakeholder engagement to ensure the regulatory rules in the states in which Duke Energy operates benefit customers and allow Duke Energy to recover its significant investments in a timely manner while maintaining affordable rates. 
                
    Engagement with regulatory commissions to determine the regulatory treatment of the impact of the Tax Act. 
     
   40 

PART II 

Primary objectives toward the implementation of this strategy include: 
  Growth Initiatives.   Growth in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure business is expected to be supported by the investment of significant capital in the electric transmission and distribution grid, and in cleaner, more efficient generation. Duke Energy expects to invest approximately $30 billion in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure growth projects over the next five years (2018-2022), continuing its efforts to generate cleaner energy. Duke Energy intends to work constructively with regulators to evaluate the current regulatory construct and seek modernized recovery solutions, such as riders, rate decoupling and multiyear rate plans, that benefit both customers and shareholders. 
  Investment projects at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure currently underway that will support growth initiatives include: 
             
    Duke Energy Indiana's $1.4 billion grid modernization plan, which is aimed at improving reliability, including fewer outages and quicker restoration.  
                
    Significant investments in combined-cycle natural gas plants, including completing the $1.5 billion Citrus County plant in Florida, the $600 million W.S. Lee facility in South Carolina and the $900 million investment in the Western Carolinas Modernization Project. These investments will allow Duke Energy to replace older, less efficient coal units. 
                
    Duke Energy expects to continue to advance other cleaner energy sources within its regulated electric jurisdictions, including hydro, wind, solar and combined heat and power projects, increasing the flexibility of the system and allowing Duke Energy to continue lowering carbon emissions.  
                
    In North Carolina, HB 589 provides a timely cost recovery mechanism for any solar investments we are able to make through a competitive market process.  
                
    In Florida, as part of the comprehensive multi-year rate settlement, we committed to invest in approximately 700 MW of solar capacity over the next five years and will be authorized to recover the cost of that investment through a single issue base rate increase. We also advanced our strategic priority of energy grid investment, establishing a multiyear recovery method for $1 billion of grid investments. 
     Duke Energy expects to invest around $7 billion growing its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure business over the next five years. Growth in Gas Utilities and Infrastructure will be focused on the following: 
             
    With the acquisition of Piedmont, Duke Energy now operates natural gas distribution businesses across five states. The continued integration of Piedmont, as well as additional investments in the natural gas Local Distribution Company (LDC) system, will help maintain system integrity and expand natural gas distribution to new customers. 
                
    Duke Energy will continue to grow its midstream pipeline business, underpinned by investments in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail and Constitution pipeline projects. These highly contracted pipelines will bring much needed, low-cost natural gas supplies to the eastern U.S., spurring economic growth and helping Duke Energy to grow its customer base in the Southeast. 
     For Commercial Renewables, Duke Energy will continue to pursue long-term contracted wind and solar projects that meet its return criteria. 
  Cost Management.   Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity into the business, leveraging its scale through competitive procurement initiatives, deploying digital transformation and continuing to identify sustainable cost savings as an essential element in response to a transforming industry. 
  Execute on Coal Ash Management Strategy  . Duke Energy will continue the company's compliance strategy with the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Duke Energy will update ash management plans to comply with the appropriate regulations and expand excavation and other compliance work at additional sites once plans and permits are approved. 
  Results of Operations 
  Non-GAAP Measures 
  Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. These items represent income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy s performance across periods.  
  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Duke Energy Board of Directors (Board of Directors), employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) and Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively.  
  Special items included in the periods presented include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:  
             
    Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from strategic acquisitions. 
                
    Cost Savings Initiatives represent severance charges related to company-wide initiatives, excluding merger integration, to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and workforce optimization. 
     
   41 

PART II 

Regulatory Settlements in 2017 represent charges related to the Levy nuclear project in Florida and the Mayo Zero Liquid Discharge and Sutton combustion turbine projects in North Carolina. The 2015 amount represents charges related to the IGCC Settlement. 
                
    Commercial Renewables Impairments represent other-than-temporary, asset and goodwill impairments. 
                
    Impacts of the Tax Act represent estimated amounts recognized related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
                
    Ash Basin Settlement and Penalties represent charges related to Plea Agreements and settlement agreements with regulators and other governmental entities. 
     Adjusted earnings also include the operating results of the nonregulated Midwest generation business and Duke Energy Retail Sales (collectively, the Midwest Generation Disposal Group) and the International Disposal Group, which have been classified as discontinued operations. Management believes inclusion of the operating results of the Disposal Groups within adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS results in a better reflection of Duke Energy's financial performance during the period. 
  Duke Energy s adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner. 
  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported Amounts to Adjusted Amounts 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.   

           (a) 
    For 2016, includes a loss on sale of the International Disposal Group. Represents the GAAP reported Loss from Discontinued Operations, less the International Disposal Group operating results, which are included in adjusted earnings. 
              (b) 
    For 2015, includes the impact of a litigation reserve related to the Midwest Generation Disposal Group. Represents (i) GAAP reported Income from Discontinued Operations, less the International Disposal Group operating results and Midwest Generation Disposal Group operating results, which are included in adjusted earnings, and (ii) a state tax charge resulting from the completion of the sale of the Midwest Generation Disposal Group but not reported as discontinued operations. 
              (c) 
    The Tax Act reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. As the tax change was enacted in 2017, Duke Energy is required to remeasure its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower rate. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, where the reduction in the net accumulated deferred income tax liability is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability.  
     Year Ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016 
  Duke Energy s full-year 2017 GAAP Reported EPS was $4.36 compared to $3.11 for full-year 2016. In addition to the adjusted diluted EPS drivers discussed below, GAAP Reported EPS in 2017 was higher primarily due to a $0.14 benefit per share related to the Tax Act in 2017, lower costs to achieve the Piedmont merger and a loss on sale and impairments associated with the sale of the International Disposal Group in 2016, partially offset by charges of $0.14 related to regulatory settlements in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure. 
  As discussed, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted earnings. Duke Energy s full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS was $4.57 compared to $4.69 for full-year 2016. The decrease in adjusted diluted EPS was primarily due to: 
             
    Lower regulated electric revenues of $0.26 per share due to less favorable weather in the current year, including lost revenues related to Hurricane Irma; 
                
    The prior year operating results from the International Disposal Group, which was sold in December 2016. The 2016 operating results included a benefit from the valuation of deferred income taxes. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes," for additional information; 
                
    Higher financing costs, primarily due to the Piedmont acquisition; and 
     
   42 

PART II 

Higher depreciation and amortization expense at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure primarily due to higher depreciable base. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    Higher regulated electric revenues from increased pricing and riders driven by new rates in Duke Energy Progress South Carolina, base rate adjustments in Florida and energy efficiency rider revenues in North Carolina, as well as growth in weather-normal retail volumes; 
                
    Lower operations, maintenance and other expenses, net of amounts recoverable in rates, at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure resulting from ongoing cost efficiency efforts and lower year-to-date storm costs than the prior year; and 
                
    Additional earnings from incremental investments in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC (ACP) and Sabal Trail natural gas pipelines. 
     Year Ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015 
  Duke Energy s full-year 2016 GAAP Reported EPS was $3.11 compared to $4.05 for full-year 2015. GAAP Reported EPS was lower primarily due to a $0.93 loss on sale of the International business, which has been presented as discontinued operations. Duke Energy also recorded $0.40 of after-tax costs to achieve the Piedmont merger in 2016, including losses on interest rate swaps related to the acquisition financing. See Note 2, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information on the Piedmont and International transactions. 
  As discussed, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted earnings. Duke Energy s full-year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS was $4.69 compared to $4.54 for full-year 2015. The variance in adjusted diluted EPS was primarily due to: 
              
    Increased retail revenues from pricing and riders, including energy efficiency programs; 
                
    Strong operations and maintenance cost control at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure; and 
                
    Piedmont s earnings contribution subsequent to the acquisition in October 2016. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    Higher storm costs at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure due to significant 2016 storms; 
                
    Higher interest expense related to additional debt outstanding; and 
                
    Higher depreciation and amortization expense at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure primarily due to higher depreciable base. 
      
  Segment Results 
  The remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Duke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy s operations is presented as Other. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Business Segments,  for additional information on Duke Energy s segment structure. 
  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) 
  On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. Among other provisions, the Tax Act lowers the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, limits interest deductions outside of regulated utility operations, and eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated utilities, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act also could be amended or subject to technical correction, which could change the financial impacts that were recorded at December 31, 2017, or are expected to be recorded in future periods. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Income Taxes," for additional information on the Tax Act. The FERC and state utility commissions will determine the regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Act for the Subsidiary Registrants. Duke Energy's segments  future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the Tax Act, subsequent amendments or corrections, or the actions of the FERC, state utility commissions or credit rating agencies related to the Tax Act. Duke Energy is reviewing orders to address the rate treatment of the Tax Act by each state utility commission in which the Subsidiary Registrants operate. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information. Beginning in January 2018, the Subsidiary Registrants will defer the estimated ongoing impacts of the Tax Act that are expected to be returned to customers. See the Credit Ratings section below for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act on the Duke Energy Registrants' credit ratings.  
  
   43 

PART II 

As a result of the Tax Act, Duke Energy revalued its existing deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, to account for the estimated future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred tax amounts. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, where the net reduction in the net accumulated deferred income tax liability is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information on the Tax Act's impact to the regulatory asset and liability accounts. The following table shows the expense (benefit) recorded on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.

PART II 

Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016    
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results were impacted by the Tax Act, growth from investments, lower operations and maintenance expense and higher weather-normal retail sales volumes, partially offset by less favorable weather, impairment charges due to regulatory settlements, increased depreciation and amortization, higher interest expense and higher property and other taxes. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $292 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenue, due to less favorable weather in the current year; and 
                
    a $235 million decrease in fuel revenues driven by lower retail sales volumes, lower fuel prices included in rates and changes in the generation mix. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $364 million increase in rider revenues including increased revenues related to energy efficiency programs, Duke Energy Florida s nuclear asset securitization, Midwest transmission and distribution capital investments and Duke Energy Indiana s Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant, as well as an increase in retail pricing due to base rate adjustments for Duke Energy Florida s Osprey acquisition and Hines Chillers and the Duke Energy Progress South Carolina rate case; 
                
    an $86 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to customers; and 
                
    a $26 million increase in other revenues primarily due to favorable transmission revenues. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $160 million increase in impairment charges primarily due to the write-off of remaining unrecovered Levy Nuclear Project costs in the current year at Duke Energy Florida and the disallowance from rate base of certain projects at the Mayo and Sutton plants in the current year at Duke Energy Progress related to the partial settlement in the North Carolina rate case; 
        a $113 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to additional plant in service; and 
     a $58 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to higher property taxes. 
  Partially offset by: 
             
    a $216 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily due to lower retail sales and changes in the generation mix; and  
                
    a $96 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to lower plant outage, storm restoration and labor and benefits costs partially offset by higher operational costs that are recoverable in rates. 
     Interest Expense.   The variance was due to higher debt outstanding in the current year and Duke Energy Florida's Crystal River 3 (CR3) regulatory asset debt return ending in June 2016 upon securitization. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income and the impact of the Tax Act. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 were 29.7 percent and 35.5 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act. See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section above for additional information on the Tax Act. 
  Year Ended December 31,   2016  , as Compared to   2015    
  Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's higher earnings were primarily due to increased pricing and rider revenues, favorable weather, a prior year impairment charge associated with the 2015 Edwardsport IGCC settlement and an increase in wholesale power margins. These impacts were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense, higher interest expense and higher operations and maintenance expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $768 million decrease in fuel revenues driven by lower fuel prices included in rates. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $414 million increase in rider revenues including increased revenues related to energy efficiency programs, the additional ownership interest in generating assets acquired from NCEMPA in the third quarter of 2015 and increased revenues related to Duke Energy Indiana s clean coal equipment, and increased retail electric pricing primarily due to the expiration of the North Carolina cost of removal decrement rider;  
                
    a $101 million increase in retail sales, net of fuel revenue, due to favorable weather compared to the prior year; and 
                
    a $76 million increase in wholesale power revenues primarily due to additional volumes and capacity charges for customers served under long-term contracts, including the NCEMPA wholesale contract. 
     
   45 

PART II 

Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $713 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily due to lower natural gas and coal prices, and lower volumes of coal and oil, partially offset by higher volumes of natural gas; and 
                
    an $85 million decrease in pretax impairment charges in the prior year primarily due to the 2015 Edwardsport IGCC settlement. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $162 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to additional plant in service, including the additional ownership interest in generating assets acquired from NCEMPA, as well as the expiration of the North Carolina cost of removal decrement rider; and 
                
    a $154 million increase in operations and maintenance expense primarily due to higher environmental and operational costs that are recoverable in rates, increased employee benefit costs, and higher storm restoration costs, partially offset by lower costs due to effective cost control efforts. 
     Other Income and Expenses.   The variance was primarily driven by higher AFUDC equity. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was due to higher debt outstanding in the current year. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 were 35.5 percent and 36.2 percent, respectively. 
  Matters Impacting Future Electric Utilities and Infrastructure Results 
  An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash impoundments could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters  and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively, for additional information. 
  On May 18, 2016, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) issued proposed risk classifications for all coal ash surface impoundments in North Carolina. All ash impoundments not previously designated as high priority by the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) were designated as intermediate risk. Certain impoundments classified as intermediate risk, however, may be reassessed in the future as low risk pursuant to legislation enacted on July 14, 2016. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to the closure of North Carolina ash impoundments are based upon the mandated closure method or a probability weighting of potential closure methods for the impoundments that may be reassessed to low risk. As the final risk ranking classifications in North Carolina are delineated, final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved for each site, the closure work progresses and the closure method scope and remedial methods are determined, the complexity of work and the amount of coal combustion material could be different than originally estimated and, therefore, could materially impact Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's financial position. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations," for additional information. 
  Duke Energy is a party to multiple lawsuits and could be subject to fines and other penalties related to operations at certain North Carolina facilities with ash basins. The outcome of these lawsuits and potential fines and penalties could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information. 
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused historic flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages within the Duke Energy Progress service territory. Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) requesting an accounting order to defer incremental operation and maintenance and capital costs incurred in response to Hurricane Matthew and other significant 2016 storms. The NCUC will address this request in Duke Energy Progress' currently pending rate case. A final order from the NCUC that disallows the deferral and future recovery of all or a significant portion of the incremental storm restoration costs incurred could result in an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information. 
  Duke Energy has several rate cases pending. Duke Energy Kentucky filed an electric rate case with the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) on September 1, 2017, to recover costs of capital investments in generation, transmission and distribution systems and to recover other incremental expenses since its previous rate case. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed general rate cases with the NCUC on August 25, 2017, and June 1, 2017, respectively, to recover costs of complying with Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) regulations and the Coal Ash Act, as well as costs of capital investments in generation, transmission and distribution systems and any increase in expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. In March 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed an electric distribution base rate case application and supporting testimony with the Public Utility Commission of Ohio (PUCO). Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's earnings could be impacted adversely if these rate increases are delayed or denied by the KPSC, NCUC or PUCO. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information. 
  On August 29, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed a 2017 Second Revised and Restated Settlement Agreement (2017 Settlement) with the FPSC. On November 20, 2017, the FPSC issued an order to approve the 2017 Settlement. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information about the 2017 Settlement. In accordance with the 2017 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will not seek recovery of any costs associated with the ongoing Westinghouse contract litigation, which is currently being appealed. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information about the litigation. An unfavorable appeals ruling on that matter could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Within this Item 7, see the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above as well as Liquidity and Capital Resources below for risks associated with the Tax Act.

PART II 

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure 

(a) 
    Includes throughput subsequent to Duke Energy's acquisition of Piedmont on October 3, 2016. 
     Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016 
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's higher results were primarily due to the inclusion of Piedmont's earnings in the current year as a result of Duke Energy's acquisition of Piedmont on October 3, 2016, as well as additional equity earnings from investments in the ACP and Sabal Trail pipelines. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    an $884 million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of Piedmont's operating revenues beginning in October 2016; and 
                
    a $47 million increase in Piedmont's fourth quarter results due to colder weather, higher natural gas prices, Integrity Management Rider (IMR) rate adjustments, customer growth and new power generation customers. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $686 million increase in operating expenses due to the inclusion of Piedmont's operating expenses beginning in October 2016; and 
                
    a $34 million increase in Piedmont's fourth quarter results primarily due to higher natural gas costs passed through to customers due to the higher price per dekatherm of natural gas. 
     Other Income and Expenses.   The increase was driven primarily by higher equity earnings from pipeline investments. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was primarily due to the inclusion of Piedmont's interest expense beginning in October 2016. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income due to the inclusion of Piedmont's earnings beginning in October 2016, partially offset by prior period true-ups. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 were 26.7 percent and 37.2 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior period true-ups and the impact of the Tax Act. See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section above for additional information on the Tax Act. 
  Year Ended December 31,   2016  , as Compared to   2015    
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's higher results were primarily due to the inclusion of Piedmont's earnings subsequent to the merger on October 3, 2016, and higher equity earnings from pipeline investments. Piedmont's earnings included in Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's results were $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
     a $398 million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of Piedmont's operating revenues beginning in October 2016, 
     
   47 

PART II 

Partially offset by: 
             
    a $38 million decrease in fuel revenues driven by lower natural gas prices and decreased sales volumes for Midwest operations. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
     a $276 million increase in operating expenses due to the inclusion of Piedmont's operating expenses beginning in October 2016. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $38 million decrease in the cost of natural gas, primarily due to decreased volumes and lower natural gas prices for Midwest operations. 
     Other Income and Expenses.   The increase was driven primarily by higher equity earnings from pipeline investments. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was primarily due to the inclusion of Piedmont's interest expenses beginning in October 2016. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 were 37.2 percent and 37.6 percent, respectively. 
  Matters Impacting Future Gas Utilities and Infrastructure Results 
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 24 percent ownership interest in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution), a natural gas pipeline project slated to transport natural gas supplies to major northeastern markets. On April 22, 2016, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation denied Constitution s application for a necessary water quality certification for the New York portion of the Constitution pipeline. Constitution has stopped construction and discontinued capitalization of future development costs until the project's uncertainty is resolved. As a result of the permitting delays and project uncertainty, total anticipated contributions by Duke Energy can no longer be reasonably estimated. To the extent the legal and regulatory proceedings have unfavorable outcomes, or if Constitution concludes that the project is not viable or does not go forward, an impairment charge of up to the recorded investment in the project, net of salvage value and any cash and working capital returned, may be recorded. Due to the FERC s January 2018 ruling and the resulting increase in uncertainty, Duke Energy is evaluating the potential to recognize a pretax impairment charge on its investment in Constitution during the first quarter of 2018 of up to the current carrying amount of the investment, net of salvage value and any cash and working capital returned. With the project on hold, funding of project costs has ceased until resolution of legal actions. At December 31, 2017, Duke Energy's investment in Constitution was   $81 million  . See Note 4 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," and "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates," respectively, for additional information. 
  Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 47 percent ownership interest in ACP, which is building an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets. Affected states (West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina) have issued certain necessary permits; the project remains subject to other pending federal and state approvals, which will allow full construction activities to begin. In early 2018, the FERC issued series of Partial Notices to Proceed which authorized the project to begin limited construction-related activities along the pipeline route. The project has a targeted in-service date of late 2019. Due to delays in obtaining the required permits to commence construction and the conditions imposed upon the project by the permits, ACP's project manager estimates the project pipeline development costs have increased from a range of $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion to a range of $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion, excluding financing costs. Project construction activities, schedule and final costs are still subject to uncertainty due to potential additional permitting delays, construction productivity and other conditions and risks that could result in potential higher project costs and a potential delay in the targeted in-service date. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information. 
  Rapidly rising interest rates without timely or adequate updates to the regulated allowed return on equity or failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Piedmont merger, including cost savings and growth targets, could significantly impact the estimated fair value of reporting units in Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. In the event of a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting units, goodwill impairment charges could be recorded. The carrying value of goodwill within Gas Utilities and Infrastructure was approximately   $1,924 million   at   December 31, 2017  .

PART II 

Commercial Renewables   

  Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016 
  Commercial Renewables' higher earnings were primarily due to the Tax Act, partially offset by pretax impairment charges. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The decrease was primarily due to lower engineering, procurement and construction revenues from REC Solar, a California-based provider of solar installations acquired by Duke Energy in 2015. 
  Operating Expenses.   The increase was primarily due to $99 million in pretax impairment charges in the current year related to a wholly owned non-contracted wind project and other investments and higher expenses associated with new wind and solar projects, partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expense at REC Solar due to fewer projects under construction. See Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Property, Plant and Equipment  and "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," respectively, for additional information. 
  Other Income and Expenses.   The variance was primarily due to a $71 million pretax impairment charge in the prior year related to certain equity method investments. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.  
  Interest Expense.   The variance was primarily due to new project financings and less capitalized interest due to fewer projects under construction. 
  Income Tax Benefit.     The variance was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act and higher production tax credits (PTCs), partially offset by lower investment tax credits (ITCs). See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate. 
  Year Ended December 31,   2016  , as Compared to   2015    
  Commercial Renewables' lower earnings were primarily due to an impairment charge related to certain equity method investments in wind projects, partially offset by new wind and solar generation placed in service and improved wind production. The following is a detailed discussion of variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was primarily due to a $135 million increase due to growth of REC Solar and a $66 million increase from new wind and solar generation placed in service and improved wind production. 
  Operating Expenses.   The variance was primarily due to a $130 million increase in operating expenses due to growth of REC Solar and a $36 million increase in operating expenses due to new wind and solar generation placed in service. 
  Other Income and Expenses.   The variance was due to a $71 million pretax impairment charge related to certain equity method investments in wind projects. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates," for additional information. 
  Income Tax Benefit.     The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income and the impact of PTCs for the renewables portfolio.

PART II 

Matters Impacting Future Commercial Renewables Result  s 
  Changes or variability in assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the Commercial Renewables reporting units for goodwill testing purposes, including but not limited to legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rates and discount rates could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the Commercial Renewables reporting units. In the event of a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the Commercial Renewables reporting units, goodwill or other asset impairment charges could be recorded. The carrying value of goodwill within Commercial Renewables was approximately   $93 million   at December 31, 2017. 
  Persistently low market pricing for wind resources, primarily in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas West market and the future expiration of tax incentives including ITCs and PTCs could result in adverse impacts to the future results of Commercial Renewables. 
  Within this Item 7, see the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above as well as Liquidity and Capital Resources below for risks associated with the Tax Act. 
   
  Other   

  Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016    
  Other s higher net expense was driven by the Tax Act, partially offset by prior year losses on forward-starting interest rate swaps and other costs related to the Piedmont acquisition, decreased severance expenses, prior year donations to the Duke Energy Foundation and insurance proceeds resulting from settlement of the shareholder litigation related to the Progress Energy merger. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues  . The increase was primarily due to higher OVEC (Ohio Valley Electric Corporation) revenues and prior year customer credits related to Piedmont merger commitments  .   See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information. 
  Operating Expenses.   The decrease was primarily due to lower transaction and integration costs associated with the Piedmont acquisition, prior year severance expenses related to cost savings initiatives, donations to the Duke Energy Foundation in 2016 as well as prior year depreciation expense and other integration costs related to the Progress Energy merger. The Duke Energy Foundation is a nonprofit organization funded by Duke Energy shareholders that makes charitable contributions to selected nonprofits and government subdivisions. 
  Other Income and Expenses.   The increase was primarily driven by insurance proceeds resulting from settlement of the shareholder litigation related to the Progress Energy merger, higher earnings from the equity method investment in NMC and increased returns on investments that fund certain employee benefit obligations. 
  Interest Expense.   The decrease was primarily due to prior year losses on forward-starting interest rate swaps related to Piedmont pre-acquisition financing, partially offset by higher interest costs on $3.75 billion of debt issued in August 2016 to fund the acquisition. For additional information see Notes 2, 6 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," "Debt and Credit Facilities" and "Derivatives and Hedging," respectively. 
  Income Tax Benefit.   The variance was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act and a decrease in pretax loss. See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate. 
  
   50 

PART II 

Year Ended December 31,   2016  , as Compared to   2015    
  Other s higher net expense was driven by costs related to the Piedmont acquisition, higher charitable donations and higher interest expense related to the Piedmont acquisition financing. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 
  Operating Revenues  . The decrease was primarily due to customer credits recorded related to Piedmont merger commitments  .   See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information. 
  Operating Expenses.   The increase was primarily due to transaction and integration costs associated with the Piedmont acquisition and increased donations to the Duke Energy Foundation, partially offset by a decrease in severance accruals. 
  Other Income and Expenses.   The variance was primarily due to lower earnings from NMC, partially offset by higher returns on investments that support employee benefit obligations. 
  Interest Expense.   The increase was primarily due to Piedmont acquisition financing, including bridge facility costs and losses on forward-starting interest rate swaps. For additional information see Notes 2 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Derivatives and Hedging," respectively. 
  Income Tax Benefit.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax losses, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 were 41.2 percent and 47.5 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefit from legal entity restructuring recorded in 2015. 
  Matters Impacting Future Other Results  
  Included in Other is Duke Energy Ohio's 9 percent ownership interest in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC), which owns 2,256 MW of coal-fired generation capacity. As a counterparty to an inter-company power agreement (ICPA), Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement to receive entitlements to capacity and energy from OVEC s power plants through June 2040 commensurate with its power participation ratio, which is equivalent to Duke Energy Ohio's ownership interest. Costs, including fuel, operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization and interest expense, are allocated to counterparties to the ICPA, including Duke Energy Ohio, based on their power participation ratio. The value of the ICPA is subject to variability due to fluctuations in power prices and changes in OVEC s costs of business. Deterioration in the credit quality or bankruptcy of one or more parties to the ICPA could increase the costs of OVEC. In addition, certain proposed environmental rulemaking costs could result in future increased cost allocations. For information on Duke Energy's regulatory filings related to OVEC, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters.  
  The retired Beckjord generating station (Beckjord), a nonregulated facility retired during 2014, is not subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule related to the disposal of CCR from electric utilities. However, if costs are incurred as a result of environmental regulations or to mitigate risk associated with on-site storage of coal ash, the costs could have an adverse impact on Other's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Within this Item 7, see the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above as well as Liquidity and Capital Resources below for risks associated with the Tax Act. 
  (LOSS) INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX   

  Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016    
  The variance was primarily driven by the prior year loss on the disposal of Duke Energy's Latin American generation business and an impairment charge related to certain assets in Central America, partially offset by a tax benefit related to historic unremitted foreign earnings and immaterial out of period tax adjustments unrelated to the Disposal Groups. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information. 
  Year Ended December 31,   2016  , as Compared to   2015    
  The variance was primarily driven by the 2016 loss on the disposal of Duke Energy's Latin American generation business and an impairment charge related to certain assets in Central America, partially offset by a tax benefit related to historic unremitted foreign earnings and immaterial out of period tax adjustments unrelated to the Disposal Groups. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information.

PART II 

SUBSIDIARY REGISTRANTS 
  As a result of the Tax Act, the Subsidiary Registrants revalued their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as of December 31, 2017, to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred tax amounts. For the Subsidiary Registrants regulated operations, where the reduction is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" for additional information on the Tax Act's impact to the regulatory asset and liability accounts. The FERC and state utility commissions will determine the regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Act for the Subsidiary Registrants. The Subsidiary Registrants  future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the Tax Act, subsequent amendments or corrections, or the actions of the FERC, state utility commissions or credit rating agencies related to the Tax Act. The change in each Subsidiary Registrant's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act, unless noted below. The following table shows the expense (benefit) recorded on the Subsidiary Registrant's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the effective tax rate for each Subsidiary Registrant.      

           (a) 
    Except where noted below, amounts are included within   Income Tax Expense From Continuing Operations   or Income Tax Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
              (b) 
    See Notes 4 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Income Taxes," for information about the Tax Act's impact on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
              (c) 
    Amount primarily relates to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities that are excluded for ratemaking purposes related to abandoned assets and certain wholesale fixed rate contracts. 
              (d) 
    Amount primarily relates to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities of certain wholesale fixed rate contracts. 
              (e) 
    Amount primarily relates to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets that are excluded for ratemaking purposes related to a prior transfer of certain electric generating assets. 
              (f) 
    Amount primarily relates to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities that are excluded for ratemaking purposes related to impaired assets.  
              (g) 
    Includes a $16 million expense recorded within   Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates   on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
              (h)

DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS 
  Introduction 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Carolinas is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 
  Results of Operations   

  The following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Carolinas. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized.   

  Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016    
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $179 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to less favorable weather in the current year.  
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $74 million increase in rider revenues and retail pricing primarily related to energy efficiency programs;  
                
    a $41 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers, net of fuel revenues;  
                
    a $30 million increase in fuel revenues primarily due to changes in generation mix partially offset by lower retail sales; and 
                
    a $7 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing and fuel, primarily due to additional volumes for customers served under long-term contracts. 
     
   53 

PART II 

Operating Expenses.     The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $145 million decrease in operations, maintenance and other expense primarily due to lower expenses at generating plants, lower costs associated with merger commitments related to the Piedmont acquisition in 2016, lower severance expenses, and lower employee benefit costs, partially offset by higher energy efficiency program costs. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $25 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily due to changes in generation mix, partially offset by lower retail sales; and 
                
    a $15 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to additional plant in service, partially offset by lower amortization of certain regulatory assets. 
     Other Income and Expenses.     The variance was primarily due to a decrease in recognition of post in-service equity returns for projects that had been completed prior to being reflected in customer rates. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income and the impact of the Tax Act, offset by the impact of research credits and the manufacturing deduction. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash impoundments could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Carolinas' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters  and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively, for additional information. 
  On May 18, 2016, the NCDEQ issued proposed risk classifications for all coal ash surface impoundments in North Carolina. All ash impoundments not previously designated as high priority by the Coal Ash Act were designated as intermediate risk. Certain impoundments classified as intermediate risk, however, may be reassessed in the future as low risk pursuant to legislation enacted on July 14, 2016. Duke Energy Carolinas' estimated AROs related to the closure of North Carolina ash impoundments are based upon the mandated closure method or a probability weighting of potential closure methods for the impoundments that may be reassessed to low risk. As the final risk ranking classifications in North Carolina are delineated, final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved for each site, the closure work progresses, and the closure method scope and remedial action methods are determined, the complexity of work and the amount of coal combustion material could be different than originally estimated and, therefore, could materially impact Duke Energy Carolinas' financial position. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations," for additional information. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas is a party to multiple lawsuits and subject to fines and other penalties related to operations at certain North Carolina facilities with ash basins. The outcome of these lawsuits, fines and penalties could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Carolinas  financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas filed a general rate case on August 25, 2017, to recover costs of complying with CCR regulations and the Coal Ash Act, as well as costs of capital investments in generation, transmission and distribution systems and any increase in expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. Duke Energy Carolinas' earnings could be adversely impacted if the rate increase is delayed or denied by the NCUC.

  Results of Operations   

  Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016    
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $231 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower retail sales and changes in generation mix at Duke Energy Progress; and 
                
    an $87 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to less favorable weather in the current year  . 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $108 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to Duke Energy Florida s base rate adjustment for the Osprey Acquisition and the completion of the Hines Energy Complex Chiller Uprate Project, as well as the Duke Energy Progress South Carolina rate case; 
                
    a $76 million increase in rider revenues related to energy efficiency programs at Duke Energy Progress, as well as nuclear asset securitization beginning in July 2016 and extended uprate project revenues beginning in 2017 at Duke Energy Florida; and 
                
    a $51 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers. 
     Operating Expenses.     The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $227 million decrease in fuel expense and purchased power primarily due to lower retail sales and changes in generation mix at Duke Energy Progress; and 
                
    a $166 million decrease in operations, maintenance and other expense primarily due to lower plant outage, storm restoration and labor costs.  
     
   55 

PART II 

Partially offset by: 
             
    a $149 million increase in impairment charges primarily due to the write-off of remaining unrecovered Levy Nuclear Project costs in the current year at Duke Energy Florida and the disallowance from rate base of certain projects at the Mayo and Sutton plants in the current year at Duke Energy Progress related to the partial settlement in the North Carolina rate case; and 
                
    a $72 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to additional plant in service, as well as nuclear regulatory asset amortization at Duke Energy Florida. 
     Interest Expense.   The variance was due to higher debt outstanding, as well as interest charges on North Carolina fuel over collections at Duke Energy Progress and lower debt returns driven by the CR3 regulatory asset debt return ending in June 2016 upon securitization at Duke Energy Florida. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash impoundments could have an adverse impact on Progress Energy s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The outcome of these lawsuits, fines and penalties could have an adverse impact on Progress Energy s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information. 
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused historic flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages within the Duke Energy Progress service territory. Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) requesting an accounting order to defer incremental operation and maintenance and capital costs incurred in response to Hurricane Matthew and other significant 2016 storms. The NCUC will address this request in Duke Energy Progress' currently pending rate case. A final order from the NCUC that disallows the deferral and future recovery of all or a significant portion of the incremental storm restoration costs incurred could result in an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information. 
  Duke Energy Progress filed a general rate case with the NCUC on June 1, 2017. Duke Energy Progress will seek to recover costs of complying with CCR regulations and the Coal Ash Act, as well as costs of capital investments in generation, transmission and distribution systems and any increase in expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. Progress Energy's earnings could be adversely impacted if the rate increase is delayed or denied by the NCUC. 
  On August 29, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed the 2017 Settlement with the FPSC. On November 20, 2017, the FPSC issued an order to approve the 2017 Settlement. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information about the 2017 Settlement. In accordance with the 2017 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will not seek recovery of any costs associated with the ongoing Westinghouse contract litigation, which is currently being appealed. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies  for additional information about the litigation. An unfavorable appeals ruling on that matter could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information. 
  Duke Energy Progress filed a general rate case with the NCUC on June 1, 2017. Duke Energy Progress will seek to recover costs of complying with CCR regulations and the Coal Ash Act, as well as costs of capital investments in generation, transmission and distribution systems and any increase in expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. Duke Energy Progress' earnings could be adversely impacted if the rate increase is delayed or denied by the NCUC. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information.

  Introduction 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Florida is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 
  Results of Operations   

  The following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Florida. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Wholesale power sales include both billed and unbilled sales. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized.   

  Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016    
  Operating Revenues.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $70 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to the base rate adjustment for the Osprey acquisition and the completion of the Hines Energy Complex Chiller Uprate Project;  
                
    a $45 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers in the current year; and 
                
    a $36 million increase in rider revenues primarily due to nuclear asset securitization beginning in July 2016 and extended power uprate project revenues beginning in 2017. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $50 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to less favorable weather in the current year, including lost revenues related to Hurricane Irma; and 
                
    a $34 million decrease in wholesale power revenues primarily due to contracts that expired in the prior year. 
     
   59 

PART II 

Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $132 million increase in impairment charges primarily due to the write-off of remaining unrecovered Levy Nuclear Project costs in the current year; and 
                
    a $51 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to nuclear regulatory asset amortization, as well as additional plant in service. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $47 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense primarily due to lower planned outage costs, lower severance expenses and lower employee benefit costs, partially offset by higher storm restoration costs in the current year. 
     Other Income and Expenses.   The variance was primarily driven by higher AFUDC equity. 
  Interest Expense.   The variance was primarily due to higher debt outstanding and lower debt returns driven by the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset debt return ending in June 2016 upon securitization. 
  Income Tax Expense.     The variance was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act and lower pretax earnings. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  On August 29, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed the 2017 Settlement with the FPSC. On November 20, 2017, the FPSC issued an order to approve the 2017 Settlement. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information about the 2017 Settlement. In accordance with the 2017 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will not seek recovery of any costs associated with the ongoing Westinghouse contract litigation, which is currently being appealed. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies  for additional information about the litigation. An unfavorable appeals ruling on that matter could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

  Basis of Presentation 
  The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Ohio is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 
  Results of Operations   

  The following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales of electricity, dekatherms of natural gas delivered and average number of electric and natural gas customers for Duke Energy Ohio. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized.   

  Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016    
  Operating Revenues  .   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $69 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower electric fuel costs and a decrease in electric and natural gas sales volumes; and 
                
    a $16 million decrease in electric retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to less favorable weather in the current year. 
     
   61 

PART II 

Partially offset by: 
             
    a $38 million increase in rider revenues primarily due to growth in energy efficiency programs and a rate increase for the distribution capital investment rider, partially offset by a decrease in the percentage of income payment plan rider due to a rate decrease; 
                
    a $10 million increase in PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) transmission revenues; 
                
    a $9 million increase in other revenues related to OVEC; and 
                
    a $6 million increase in non-native sales for resale. 
     Operating Expenses  . The variance was driven by: 
             
    a $66 million decrease in fuel expense, primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower electric fuel costs. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $28 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service and a true-up related to SmartGrid assets in the prior year; 
                
    a $20 million increase in property and other taxes due to higher property taxes; and  
                
    a $12 million increase in operations, maintenance and other expense primarily due to higher energy efficiency program costs and higher transmission and distribution operations costs; partially offset by lower fossil/hydro operations costs due to timing of outage schedules. 
     Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate. 
  Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax.   The variance was primarily driven by a prior year income tax benefit resulting from immaterial out of period deferred tax liability adjustments related to the Midwest Generation Disposal Group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," for additional information. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Ohio's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters  and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively, for additional information. 
  Duke Energy Ohio s nonregulated Beckjord station, a facility retired during 2014, is not subject to the EPA rule related to the disposal of CCR from electric utilities. However, if costs are incurred as a result of environmental regulations or to mitigate risk associated with on-site storage of coal ash at the facility, the costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Ohio's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Duke Energy Ohio has a 9 percent ownership interest in OVEC, which owns 2,256 MW of coal-fired generation capacity. As a counterparty to an ICPA, Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement to receive entitlements to capacity and energy from OVEC s power plants through June 2040 commensurate with its power participation ratio, which is equivalent to Duke Energy Ohio s ownership interest. Costs, including fuel, operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization and interest expense, are allocated to counterparties to the ICPA, including Duke Energy Ohio, based on their power participation ratio. The value of the ICPA is subject to variability due to fluctuations in power prices and changes in OVEC s costs of business. Deterioration in the credit quality or bankruptcy of one or more parties to the ICPA could increase the costs of OVEC. In addition, certain proposed environmental rulemaking costs could result in future increased cost allocations.  
  On March 2, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed an electric distribution base rate application with the PUCO to address recovery of electric distribution system capital investments and any increase in expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. The application also includes requests to continue certain current riders and establish new riders related to LED Outdoor Lighting Service and regulatory mandates. Duke Energy Ohio's earnings could be adversely impacted if the rate case and requested riders are delayed or denied by the PUCO. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information. 
  On September 1, 2017, Duke Energy Kentucky filed a base rate case with the KPSC to recover costs of capital investments in generation, transmission and distribution systems and to recover other incremental expenses since its last rate case filed in 2006. The application also includes request to establish new riders. Duke Energy Kentucky s earnings could be adversely impacted if the rate increase is delayed or denied by the KPSC.

  Basis of Presentation 
  The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Indiana is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 
  Results of Operations   

  The following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Indiana. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized.   

  Year Ended December 31,   2017  , as Compared to   2016    
  Operating Revenues.     The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $67 million increase in rate rider revenues primarily related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, the Transmission, Distribution and Storage System Improvement Charge (TDSIC) and energy efficiency programs; and 
                
    a $48 million increase in fuel revenues primarily due to higher purchased power costs passed through to customers and higher financial transmission rights (FTR) revenues. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $13 million decrease in retail sales due to less favorable weather in the current year; and 
                
    a $13 million decrease in wholesale power revenues, net of fuel, primarily due to a decrease in demand rates and contracts that expired in the current year. 
     Operating Expenses.   The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $57 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power expenses, primarily due to higher purchased power volumes, partially offset by favorable fuel prices; 
                
    an $18 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to higher franchise taxes; 
     
   63 

PART II 

a $10 million increase in operations, maintenance and other expense primarily due to growth in energy efficiency programs and higher transmission costs; and 
                
    a $10 million increase in impairments and other charges primarily due to the impairment of certain metering equipment not recoverable in customer rates. 
      Partially offset by: 
             
    a $38 million decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the recognition of certain asset retirement obligations in 2016 that were subsequently deferred in 2017, partially offset by new IGCC rates that result in a lower deferral amount and higher depreciation due to additional plant in service.  
     Other Income and Expense.   The variance was driven primarily by higher AFUDC equity. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act and an increase in pretax income. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  On April 17, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. Duke Energy Indiana has interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. Duke Energy Indiana's interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to potential legal challenges and further regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Indiana's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information. 
  In August 2016, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a settlement agreement between Duke Energy Indiana and multiple parties that resolves all disputes, claims and issues from the IURC proceedings related to post-commercial operating performance and recovery of ongoing operating and capital costs at the Edwardsport IGCC generating facility. The settlement agreement imposed a cost cap for retail recoverable operations and maintenance costs through 2017. An inability to manage future operating costs may result in unfavorable orders that could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Indiana's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

PIEDMONT 
     Introduction 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the year ended December 31, 2017, Piedmont's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2016, and the Form 10-QT as of December 31, 2016, for the transition period from November 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The unaudited results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, was derived from data previously reported in the reports noted above. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The results of operations and variance discussion for Piedmont is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 
  Results of Operations   

  The following table shows the percent changes in dekatherms delivered and average number of customers. The percentages for all throughput deliveries represent billed and unbilled sales. Amounts are not weather-normalized.   

  Piedmont's throughput was 468,259,777 dekatherms and 495,122,794 dekatherms for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Due to the margin decoupling mechanism in North Carolina and weather normalization adjustment (WNA) mechanisms in South Carolina and Tennessee, changes in throughput deliveries do not have a material impact on Piedmont's revenues or earnings. The margin decoupling mechanism adjusts for variations in residential and commercial use per customer, including those due to weather and conservation. The WNA mechanisms mostly offset the impact of weather on bills rendered, but do not ensure full recovery of approved margin during periods when winter weather is significantly warmer or colder than normal.

PART II 

Year Ended December 31, 2017, as Compared to 2016  
  Operating Revenues.     The variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $74 million increase due to higher natural gas costs passed through to customers primarily due to higher natural gas prices; 
                
    a $34 million increase in revenues to residential and commercial customers, net of natural gas costs passed through to customers, primarily due to Integrity Management Rider (IMR) rate adjustments and customer growth. Increase is also due to new power generation customers, and is partially offset by wholesale marketing revenue; and 
                
    a $10 million increase in revenues due to merger-related bill credits applied to customer bills in 2016.  
     Operating Expenses.     The variance was driven by: 
             
    a $73 million increase in costs of natural gas primarily due to higher natural gas costs passed through to customers due to the higher price per dekatherm of natural gas; 
                
    a $15 million increase in depreciation expense     and property and franchise taxes due to additional plant in service; and 
                
    a $7 million increase due to an impairment of software resulting from planned accounting system and process integration in 2018. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $38 million decrease in operations, maintenance and other related to acquisition and integration expenses recorded in the prior year from costs paid to outside parties, primarily financial and legal advisory, severance expenses, retention costs and acceleration of incentive plans, and an accrual for our commitment of charitable contributions and community support. 
     Other Income and Expense.   The variance was driven by: 
             
    a $132 million decrease in gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliates recorded in the prior year due to Piedmont s sale of its 15 percent ownership interest in SouthStar Energy Services, LLC (SouthStar) on October 3, 2016; and 
                
    a $32 million decrease in equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to equity earnings from the investment in SouthStar in the prior year and the impacts of the Tax Act in the current year. 
     Income Tax Expense.   The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income and the impact of the Tax Act. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate. 
  Matters Impacting Future Results 
  Within this Item 7, see the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above as well as Liquidity and Capital Resources below for risks associated with the Tax Act. 
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  Preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations, cash flows or the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations.  
  Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. 
  For further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." 
  Regulated Operations Accounting 
  Substantially all of Duke Energy s regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred.  
  Management continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy s jurisdictions, litigation of rate orders, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, levels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. For further information on regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters.  
  
   66 

PART II 

As required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost, such as closure costs for ash impoundments, qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for a more in-depth discussion of Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. 
  Regulated operations accounting rules also require recognition of a disallowance (also called "impairment") loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed or an abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. For example, if a cost cap is set for a plant still under construction, the amount of the disallowance is a result of a judgment as to the ultimate cost of the plant. Other disallowances can require judgments on allowed future rate recovery. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for a discussion of disallowances recorded. 
  When it becomes probable that regulated assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value that may be retained as a regulatory asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an impairment charge, if any, could be partially or fully offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable. The impairment for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows. 
  For further information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters." 
  Goodwill Impairment Assessments 
  Duke Energy allocates goodwill to reporting units, which are either the Business Segments listed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements or one level below based on how the Business Segment is managed. Duke Energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value. Duke Energy performs its annual impairment test as of August 31. 
  Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management's judgment, including determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation, utility sector market performance and transactions, forecasted earnings base, projected operating and capital cash flows for Duke Energy s business and the fair value of debt. 
  Estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on Duke Energy s internal business plan, and adjusted as appropriate for Duke Energy s views of market participant assumptions. Duke Energy s internal business plan reflects management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third-party sources, projected commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations. The business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of returns on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to significant future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service, the renewal of certain contracts and the future of renewable tax credits. Management also makes assumptions regarding operation, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. In estimating cash flows, Duke Energy incorporates expected growth rates, regulatory and economic stability, the ability to renew contracts and other factors, into its revenue and expense forecasts. 
  One of the most significant assumptions that Duke Energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the   2017   impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31,   2017  , for each of Duke Energy s reporting units ranged from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent. The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges. 
  One of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31. 
  In December 2016, Duke Energy disposed of its International operations and no longer has goodwill associated with the International operations. For further information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Acquisitions and Dispositions.  
  Duke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity. 
  As of August 31,   2017  , all of the reporting units  estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity, except for the Commercial Renewables reporting units. The goodwill at the Energy Management Solutions reporting unit of Commercial Renewables was evaluated for recoverability in 2017, and Duke Energy recorded impairment charges of $29 million. 
  
   67 

PART II 

The Commercial Renewables reporting units are impacted by a multitude of factors including, legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rate assumptions and discount rates. As of August 31, 2017, the Renewables reporting unit s estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by less than 10 percent. Management continues to monitor these assumptions for any indicators that the fair value of the reporting unit could be below the carrying value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate  . 
  For further information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets." 
  Asset Retirement Obligations 
  AROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Substantially all AROs are related to regulated operations. When recording an ARO, the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. For operating plants, the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. For retired plants, the present value of the liability is recorded as a regulatory asset unless determined not to be recoverable. 
  The present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the ARO for regulated operations through a combination of regulated revenues and earnings on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF). As a result, accretion expense and depreciation of the associated ARO asset are netted and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. 
  Obligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. Duke Energy Florida assumes Crystal River Unit 3 will be placed into a safe storage configuration until eventual dismantlement is completed by 2074. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility. 
  Obligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans, if known, or probability weightings of the potential closure methods if the closure plans are under development and multiple closure options are being considered and evaluated on a site-by-site basis. 
  For further information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations." 
  Long-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated Operations, and Equity Method Investments 
  Property, plant and equipment, excluding plant held for sale, is stated at the lower of carrying value (historical cost less accumulated depreciation and previously recorded impairments) or fair value, if impaired. Duke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value. 
  Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.  
  When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.  
  Investments in affiliates that are not controlled by Duke Energy, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.  Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value.  It the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.  
  For further information, see Notes 10 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Property, Plant and Equipment" and  Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates,  respectively.  
  Revenue Recognition  
  Revenues on sales of electricity and natural gas are recognized when service is provided or the product is delivered. As retail meters are read, invoices are prepared and the invoice amount is generally recognized as "billed" revenue. Operating revenues also include "unbilled" electric and natural gas revenues for the amount of service provided or product delivered after the last meter reading prior to the end of the accounting period. Unbilled retail revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt-hour (kWh), per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) or per dekatherm (dth) for all customer classes to the number of estimated kWh, Mcf or dth delivered but not yet billed.  
  For wholesale customers, the invoice amount is generally recognized as  billed  revenue. Although meters are read as of the end of the month, invoices have typically not been prepared. An estimate of the wholesale invoice is included in the reported amount of  unbilled  revenue.  
  
   68 

PART II 

The amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors that impact the change in the unbilled revenue receivable balance, including seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer mix, timing of rendering customer bills, meter readings schedules and the average price in effect for customer classes.  
  Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits 
  The calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payments. Additionally, the health care cost trend rate assumption is critical to Duke Energy s estimate of other post-retirement benefits. 
  Duke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amounts that are in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period. Prior service cost or credit, which represents an increase or decrease in a plan's pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period. 
  Duke Energy maintains and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. Most participants in the qualified plans earn benefits calculated using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage, which varies with age and years of service, of current eligible earnings and current interest credits. Certain plan participants earn benefits that use a final average earnings formula. Certain executives are participants in non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. These qualified and non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new participants. 
  Duke Energy provides some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans.  
  Assets for Duke Energy s qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits (401(h) accounts) are maintained in the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust (Master Trust). Duke Energy also invests other post-retirement assets in Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association trusts. The investment objective is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants.  
  As of   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability. Hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments.  
  In 2013, Duke Energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for the Master Trust. As the funded status of the pension plans increase, the targeted allocation to fixed-income assets may be increased to better manage Duke Energy's pension liability and reduce funded status volatility. The asset allocation for the Master Trust is 63 percent fixed-income assets and 37 percent return-seeking assets. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate. 
  Duke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 3.6 percent as of   December 31, 2017  . Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected. 
  Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy s pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy s   2017   pretax pension expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25 percent change in rates were to occur.   

69 

PART II 

Duke Energy s other post-retirement plan uses a health care trend rate covering both pre- and post-age 65 retired plan participants, which is comprised of a medical care trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in medical costs, and a prescription drug trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug costs. As of   December 31, 2017  , the health care trend rate was 7 percent, trending down to 4.75 percent by 2024. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy s   2017   pretax other post-retirement expense and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 1 percentage point change in the health care trend rate were to occur. These plans are closed to new hires.    

  For further information, see Note   21   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,    Employee Benefit Plans  .  
  Income Taxes 
  Duke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state returns. The Subsidiary Registrants entered into a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. ITCs associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties. 
  Accumulated deferred income taxes are valued using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. In the event of a change in tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured as of the enactment date of the new rate. To the extent that the change in the value of the deferred tax represents an obligation to customers, the impact of the remeasurement is deferred to a regulatory liability. Remaining impacts are recorded in income from continuing operations. Other impacts of the Tax Act have been recorded on a provisional basis, see Note 22,  Income Taxes,  for additional information. If Duke Energy's estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is not reflective of actual outcomes, is modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal then Duke Energy's results of operations could be impacted. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Duke Energy s projected primary sources and uses for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.   

           (a) 
    Excludes capital leases. Duke Energy projects a reduction in short-term debt in 2020. 
              (b) 
    Subject to approval by the Board of Directors. 
               (d) 
    2018 equity issuances to be achieved through a public offering and through issuances under the Equity Distribution Agreement and the Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP). See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Common Stock" for additional information. 
     
   70 

PART II 

Among other provisions, the Tax Act lowers the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. For Duke Energy s regulated operations, the reduction in federal income taxes is expected to result in lower regulated customer rates. However, due to its existing NOL (Net operating loss) position and other tax credits, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash tax payer through at least 2022. As a result, any reduction in customer rates could cause a material reduction in consolidated cash flows from operations in the short-term. Over time, the reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Act will increase Duke Energy s regulated rate base investments and customer rates. See the Credit Ratings section below for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act on the Duke Energy Registrants' credit ratings. Impacts of Tax Act to Duke Energy s cash flows and credit metrics are subject to the regulatory actions of its state commissions and the FERC, which are currently pending. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information.  
  In order to strengthen its balance sheet and credit metrics and bolster cash flows, Duke Energy plans to issue $2 billion of common stock equity during 2018, including its previous plan to issue $350 million annually through its DRIP beginning in 2018, as well as reduce its capital expenditures during 2018-2022 by approximately $1 billion. 
  The Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Debt and Credit Facilities,  for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement. 
  Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy s current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses. 
  Credit Facilities and Registration Statements 
  See Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants.  
   
  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
  Duke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors. Duke Energy s projected capital and investment expenditures for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.   

DEBT MATURITIES 
  See Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further information regarding significant components of Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
   
  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS 
  In   2017  , Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 91st consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
  Duke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 70 percent and 75 percent, based upon adjusted diluted EPS. In   2016   and   2017  , Duke Energy increased the dividend by approximately 4 percent annually. Through 2022, the annual dividend growth rate is expected to be between approximately 4 to 6 percent.  
  
   71 

PART II 

Dividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries 
  As discussed in Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  Duke Energy s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which, in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At   December 31, 2017  , the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend is less than 25 percent of Duke Energy s net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations. 
   
  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
  Cash flows from operations of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy s operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations. 
  Duke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  for additional information). 
  At   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $358 million  . 
   
  DEBT ISSUANCES 
  Depending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt. 
  See to Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further information regarding significant debt issuances.  
  Duke Energy s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below.    

  Duke Energy s fixed charges coverage ratio, calculated using Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidelines, was   2.9   times for   2017  ,   2.7   times for   2016   and   3.1   times for   2015  . 
  Restrictive Debt Covenants 
  Duke Energy s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65 percent for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70 percent for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of   December 31, 2017  , each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.

(a) 
    In January 2018, Moody's revised the ratings outlook for Duke Energy Corporation and Piedmont from stable to negative, principally due to risk of deterioration in credit metrics resulting from the Tax Act. See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section above for additional information on the Tax Act. 
     Credit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold. The Duke Energy Registrants  credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies  assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted. 
   
  Cash Flow Information 
  The following table summarizes Duke Energy s cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years.

PART II 

OPERATING CASH FLOWS 
  The following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy s operating cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years.   

  For the year ended   December 31, 2017  , compared to   2016  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $1,325 million decrease in working capital due to weather, payment of merger transaction and integration related costs and increased property tax payments in 2017. 
     Offset by: 
             
    a $969 million increase in net income after non-cash adjustments primarily due to the inclusion of Piedmont's earnings for a full year, favorable pricing and weather-normal retail volumes driven by the residential class in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure Segment combined with continued strong cost control; 
                
    a $136 million decrease in contributions to qualified pension plans; and 
                
    a $37 million decrease in payments to AROs. 
     For the year ended   December 31, 2016  , compared to   2015  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $388 million increase in cash flows from working capital primarily due to the sale of the International business; and 
                
    a $147 million decrease in contributions to qualified pension plans. 
     Offset by: 
             
    a $262 million increase in payments for AROs; and 
                
    a $156 million decrease in net income after non-cash adjustments due to higher storm costs offset by favorable weather, increased rider revenues, higher wholesale margins and strong cost control. 
      
  INVESTING CASH FLOWS

  The primary use of cash related to investing activities is capital, investment and acquisition expenditures, detailed by reportable business segment in the following table.   

74 

PART II 

For the year ended   December 31, 2017  , compared to   2016  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $5,017 million decrease in capital, investment and acquisition expenditures mainly due to the Piedmont acquisition in the prior year. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $1,418 million decrease in net proceeds from sales of discontinued operations due to the prior year sale of the International business. 
     For the year ended   December 31, 2016  , compared to   2015  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $4,852 million increase in capital, investment and acquisition expenditures mainly due to the Piedmont acquisition; and  
                
    a $1,550 million decrease in net proceeds from sales of discontinued operations mainly due to the variance in proceeds between the 2015 sale of the Midwest generation business and the 2016 sale of the International business. 
     FINANCING CASH FLOWS 
  The following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy s financing cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years.   

  For the year ended   December 31, 2017  , compared to   2016  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $2,722 million net decrease in proceeds from issuances of long-term debt driven principally by the prior year $3,750 million of senior unsecured notes used to fund a portion of the Piedmont acquisition, offset primarily by $900 million of first mortgage bonds issued by Duke Energy Florida in the current year to fund capital expenditures for ongoing construction and capital maintenance and for general corporate purposes; 
                
    a $731 million decrease in proceeds from stock issuances used to fund a portion of the Piedmont acquisition in 2016; and 
                
    a $118 million current year increase in dividends paid. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $1,085 million decrease in net borrowings from notes payable and commercial paper primarily due to the use of proceeds from $1,294 million nuclear asset-recovery bonds issued at Duke Energy Florida in 2016 to pay down outstanding commercial paper. 
     For the year ended   December 31, 2016  , compared to   2015  , the variance was driven primarily by: 
             
    a $7,389 million increase in proceeds from net issuances of long-term debt mainly due to the issuances of $3,750 million of senior unsecured notes used to fund a portion of the Piedmont acquisition, $1,294 million of nuclear asset-recovery bonds and other issuances primarily used to fund capital expenditures, pay down outstanding commercial paper and repay debt maturities; 
                 
    a $714 million increase in proceeds resulting from the issuance of common stock to fund the acquisition of Piedmont. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    a $2,692 million increase in cash outflows for the net payments of notes payable and commercial paper primarily through the use of proceeds from $1,294 million nuclear asset-recovery bonds issued at Duke Energy Florida, further increased by the use of short-term debt in 2015 to repay long-term debt maturities at Duke Energy Florida in advance of the 2016 proceeds from the nuclear asset-recovery bonds. 
      
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. 
  
   75 

PART II 

Most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital) through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007, spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp, having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. 
  Duke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. 
  See Note   7   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Guarantees and Indemnifications,  for further details of the guarantee arrangements. 
  Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
  Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above, normal operating lease arrangements and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Notes   5  ,   7   and   17   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  "Guarantees and Indemnifications" and "  Variable Interest Entities  ," respectively. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  Duke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes Duke Energy s contractual cash obligations as of   December 31, 2017  .   

           (a) 
    See Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Debt and Credit Facilities.  
              (b) 
    Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using   December 31, 2017  , interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments. 
              (c) 
    See Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.  Amounts in the table above include the interest component of capital leases based on the interest rates stated in the lease agreements and exclude certain related executory costs. Amounts exclude contingent lease obligations. 
              (d) 
    Current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term debt, and purchase obligations reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been excluded from the above table. 
              (e) 
    Includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS). For contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at   December 31, 2017  , or the best projections of the index. For certain of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting arrangements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. 
              (f) 
    Amounts exclude obligations under the OVEC purchase power agreement. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Variable Interest Entities," for additional information. 
              (g) 
    Includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering, procurement and construction costs for new generation plants, wind and solar facilities, plant refurbishments, maintenance and day-to-day contract work and commitments to buy certain products. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. 
              (h) 
    Related to future annual funding obligations to NDTF through nuclear power stations' relicensing dates. See Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations." 
              (i) 
    Unrecognized tax benefits of   $25 million   are not reflected in this table as Duke Energy cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note   22   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Income Taxes." 
     
   76 

PART II 

(j) 
    The table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance claims (see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies ) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing and amount of cash payments that will be required. Additionally, the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including nuclear insurance (see Note   5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies ), funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (see Note   21   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Employee Benefit Plans"), AROs, including ash management expenditures (see Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations") and regulatory liabilities (see Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters ) because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are Deferred Income Taxes and ITCs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year.  
      
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Risk Management Policies 
  The Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy includes strategy, operational, project execution and financial or transaction related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.  
  Duke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits. 
  The following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please review Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  and  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets. Duke Energy s exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost-based regulation of its regulated operations as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations. 
  Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note   14   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Derivatives and Hedging.  
  The inputs and methodologies used to determine the fair value of contracts are validated by an internal group separate from Duke Energy s deal origination function. While Duke Energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in its pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition. 
  Hedging Strategies 
  Duke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers. 
  The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy s commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings. 
  Duke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract s fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring. 
  Generation Portfolio Risks  
  The Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their generation portfolios, which include generation assets, fuel and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units.  
  
   77 

PART II 

For the Electric Utilities segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers.  
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes   1  ,   6  ,   14   and   16   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,   Debt and Credit Facilities,   Derivatives and Hedging,  and  Fair Value Measurements.  
  At   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy had   $687 million   notional amount of floating-to-fixed swaps outstanding,   $500 million   notional amount of fixed-to-floating swaps outstanding and   $400 million   forward-starting swaps outstanding. Duke Energy had   $6.1 billion   of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at   December 31, 2017  . The impact of a 100 basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately   $61 million   at   December 31, 2017  . This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of   December 31, 2017  . 
  See Note   14  , "Derivatives and Hedging," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the forward-starting interest rate swaps related to the Piedmont acquisition. 
  Credit Risk 
  Credit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits.  
  To reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants  internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash or letters of credit from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note   14   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Derivatives and Hedging,  for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants  principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are regional transmission organizations, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from such entities throughout these regions. These concentrations of receivables may affect the Duke Energy Registrants  overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants  credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non-performance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk. 
  Credit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants  service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction, at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through Cinergy Receivables Company LLC (CRC), a Duke Energy consolidated variable interest entity. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note   17   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Variable Interest Entities.   
  Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. Duke Energy Carolinas  cumulative payments began to exceed the self-insurance retention in 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries indemnification and medical cost claim payments is   $797 million   in excess of the self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were   $489 million   and   $587 million   at   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , respectively. These amounts are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating. 
  
   78 

PART II 

The Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note   7   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Guarantees and Indemnifications,  for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.  
  Based on the Duke Energy Registrants  policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.  
  Marketable Securities Price Risk 
  As described further in Note   15   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,  Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 
  Pension Plan Assets 
  Duke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Employee Benefit Plans,  for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets. 
  A significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy s results of operations in those periods. 
  Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds 
  As required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of   December 31, 2017  , these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes.  
  Accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations,  for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note   15   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,  for additional information regarding NDTF assets.

PART II 

Environmental Regulations 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  The following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  Coal Combustion Residuals 
  In April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments that are no longer receiving CCR but contain liquid located at stations currently generating electricity (regardless of fuel source). The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. Various industry and environmental parties have appealed EPA's CCR rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court). On April 18, 2016, EPA filed a motion with the federal court to settle five issues raised in litigation. On June 14, 2016, the court approved the motion with respect to all of those issues. Duke Energy does not expect a material impact from the settlement or that it will result in additional ARO adjustments. On September 13, 2017, EPA responded to a petition by the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group that the agency would reconsider certain provisions of the final rule, and asked the D.C. Circuit Court to suspend the litigation. The D.C. Circuit Court denied EPA s petition to suspend the litigation and oral argument was held on November 20, 2017. The court has not issued an order in the matter. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of the litigation.  
  In a November 15, 2017, status report filed with the D.C. Circuit Court, EPA listed the provisions it intends to reconsider, including provisions that warrant revision due to passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which allows for implementation of the CCR rule through state or federal permit programs. EPA has indicated it will issue a proposed rule in early 2018 that includes provisions from the June 2016 settlement with petitioners and additional provisions under reconsideration. The reconsideration would not repeal the CCR rule; rather, it would modify some requirements to align with the implementation of the rule through permit programs. At this time, Duke Energy does not expect a reconsideration rulemaking to have a material impact on its coal ash basin closure plans or compliance requirements under the CCR rule.  
  In addition to the requirements of the federal CCR regulation, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be independently regulated by most states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations. For more information, see Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations."  
  Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 
  AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act requires Duke Energy to undertake dam improvement projects and to provide access to a permanent alternative drinking water source to certain residents within a half-mile of coal ash basin compliance boundaries and to certain other potentially impacted residents. The legislation requires excavation of the Sutton, Riverbend and Dan River basins by August 1, 2019, and Asheville basins by August 1, 2022. Excavation at these sites may include a combination of transfer of coal ash to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use. Basins at the H.F. Lee, Cape Fear and Weatherspoon sites are required to be closed through excavation no later than August 1, 2028. Excavation at these sites can include conversion of the basin to a lined industrial landfill, transfer of ash to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use. The remaining basins are required to be closed no later than December 31, 2024, through conversion to a lined industrial landfill, transfer to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use, unless certain dam improvement projects and alternative drinking water source projects are completed by October 15, 2018. Upon satisfactory completion of these projects, the closure deadline would be extended to December 31, 2029, and could include closure through the combination of a cap system and a groundwater monitoring system.  
  Additionally, the Coal Ash Act requires the installation and operation of three large-scale coal ash beneficiation projects to produce reprocessed ash for use in the concrete industry. Duke Energy selected the Buck, H.F. Lee and Cape Fear plants for these projects. Closure at these sites is required to be completed no later than December 31, 2029.  
  The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Consistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy has submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective plans to NCDEQ and will submit to NCDEQ site-specific coal ash impoundment closure plans in advance of closure. These plans and all associated permits must be approved by NCDEQ before closure work can begin. 
  For further information on AROs, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations.

PART II 

Clean Water Act 316(b) 
  EPA published the final 316(b) cooling water intake structure rule on August 15, 2014, with an effective date of October 14, 2014. The rule applies to 26 of the electric generating facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own and operate. The rule allows for several options to demonstrate compliance and provides flexibility to the state environmental permitting agencies to make determinations on controls, if any, that will be required for cooling water intake structures. Any required intake structure modifications and/or retrofits are expected to be installed in the 2019 to 2023 time frame. Petitions challenging the rule have been filed by several groups. Oral argument was held on September 14, 2017. It is unknown when the courts will rule on the petitions. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 
  Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines 
  On January 4, 2016, the final Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) rule became effective. The rule establishes new requirements for wastewater streams associated with steam electric power generation and includes more stringent controls for any new coal plants that may be built in the future. As originally written, affected facilities were required to comply between 2018 and 2023, depending on the timing of Clean Water Act (CWA) discharge permits. Most of the steam electric generating facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own are affected sources. The Duke Energy Registrants are well-positioned to meet the majority of the requirements of the rule due to current efforts to convert to dry ash handling. Petitions challenging the rule have been filed by several groups. On March 16, 2015, Duke Energy Indiana filed its own legal challenge to the rule with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals specific to the ELG rule focused on the limits imposed on IGCC facilities (gasification wastewater). All challenges to the rule were consolidated in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 22, 2017, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted EPA s Motion to Govern Further Proceedings, thereby severing and suspending the claims related to flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water and gasification wastewater. Claims regarding gasification wastewater were stayed, pending the issuance of the variance to Duke Energy Indiana. The litigation will continue as to claims related to other waste streams.  
  On August 7, 2017, EPA issued a public notice regarding its proposed decision to grant a variance to Duke Energy Indiana for mercury and total dissolved solids for gasification wastewater at its Edwardsport facility. The public comment period has ended, but EPA has not finalized its decision. Separate from the litigation, EPA finalized a rule on September 18, 2017, postponing the earliest applicability date for bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater from 2018 to 2020 and retaining the end applicability date of 2023. Also, as part of the rule, EPA reiterated its intent to review the limitation guidelines for bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater and potentially to conduct a new rulemaking to revise those guidelines.  
  The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 
  Estimated Cost and Impacts of Rulemakings 
  Duke Energy will incur capital expenditures to comply with the environmental regulations and rules discussed above. The following table provides five-year estimated costs, excluding AFUDC, of new control equipment that may need to be installed on existing power plants primarily to comply with the Coal Ash Act requirements for conversion to dry disposal of bottom ash and fly ash, CWA 316(b) and ELGs through December 31, 2022. The table excludes ash basin closure costs recorded in Asset retirement obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information related to AROs, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    

  The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance and other expenses, in addition to costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements, as a result of these regulations. Actual compliance costs incurred may be materially different from these estimates due to reasons such as the timing and requirements of EPA regulations and the resolution of legal challenges to the rules. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek rate recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with regulated operations to comply with these regulations.

PART II 

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 
  On December 3, 2015, EPA proposed a rule to lower the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Phase 2 state ozone season nitrogen oxide (NO  X  ) emission budgets for 23 eastern states, including North Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. EPA also proposed to eliminate the CSAPR Phase 2 ozone season state NO  X   budgets for Florida and South Carolina. On September 7, 2016, EPA finalized a CSAPR Update Rule that reduces the CSAPR Phase 2 state ozone season NO  X   emission budgets for 22 eastern states, including Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. In the final CSAPR Update Rule, EPA removed Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina from the ozone season NOx program. Beginning in 2017, Duke Energy Registrants in these states will not be subject to any CSAPR ozone season NOx emission limitations. For the states that remain in the program, the reduced state ozone season NOx emission budgets took effect on May 1, 2017. In Kentucky and Indiana, where Duke Energy Registrants own and operate coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) subject to the final rule requirements, near-term responses include changing unit dispatch to run certain generating units less frequently and/or purchasing NOx allowances from the trading market. Longer term, upgrading the performance of existing NOx controls is an option. The Indiana Utility Group and the Indiana Energy Association jointly filed a petition for reconsideration asking that EPA correct errors it made in calculating the Indiana budget and increase the budget accordingly. EPA has yet to act on the petition. Numerous parties have filed petitions with the D.C. Circuit Court challenging various aspects of the CSAPR Update Rule. Final briefs in the case are due April 9, 2018. The date for oral argument has not been established. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.  
  Carbon Pollution Standards for New, Modified and Reconstructed Power Plants 
  On October 23, 2015, EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register establishing carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) emissions limits for new, modified and reconstructed power plants. The requirements for new plants apply to plants that commenced construction after January 8, 2014. EPA set an emissions standard for coal units of 1,400 pounds of CO   2    per gross MWh, which would require the application of partial carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology for a coal unit to be able to meet the limit. Utility-scale CCS is not currently a demonstrated and commercially available technology for coal-fired EGUs, and therefore the final standard effectively prevents the development of new coal-fired generation. EPA set a final standard of 1,000 pounds of CO  2   per gross MWh for new natural gas combined-cycle units. 
  On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing EPA to review the rule and determine whether to suspend, revise or rescind it. On the same day, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a motion with the D.C. Circuit Court requesting that the court stay the litigation of the rule while it is reviewed by EPA. Subsequent to the DOJ motion, the D.C. Circuit Court canceled oral argument in the case. On August 10, 2017, the court ordered that the litigation be suspended indefinitely. The rule remains in effect pending the outcome of litigation and EPA s review. EPA has not announced a schedule for completing its review. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, but do not expect the impacts of the current final standards will be material to Duke Energy's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
  Clean Power Plan  
  On October 23, 2015, EPA published in the Federal Register the final Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule that regulates CO   2    emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs. The CPP established CO   2    emission rates and mass cap goals that apply to existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs. Petitions challenging the rule were filed by several groups and on February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a stay of the final CPP rule, halting implementation of the rule until legal challenges are resolved. States in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate have suspended work on the CPP in response to the stay. Oral arguments before 10 of the 11 judges on D.C. Circuit Court were heard on September 27, 2016. The court has not issued its opinion in the case.  
  On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing EPA to review the CPP and determine whether to suspend, revise or rescind the rule. On the same day, the DOJ filed a motion with the D.C. Circuit Court requesting that the court stay the litigation of the rule while it is reviewed by EPA. On April 28, 2017, the court issued an order to suspend the litigation for 60 days. On August 8, 2017, the court, on its own motion, extended the suspension of the litigation for an additional 60 days. On October 16, 2017, EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) to repeal the CPP based on a change to EPA s legal interpretation of the section of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on which the CPP was based. In the proposal, EPA indicates that it has not determined whether it will issue a rule to replace the CPP, and if it will do so, when and what form that rule will take. The comment period on EPA's NPR ends April 26, 2018. On December 28, 2017, EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in which it seeks public comment on various aspects of a potential CPP replacement rule. The comment period on the ANPRM ends February 26, 2018. If EPA decides to move forward with a CPP replacement rule, it will need to issue a formal proposal for public comment. Litigation of the CPP remains on hold in the D.C. Circuit Court and the February 2016 U.S. Supreme Court stay of the CPP remains in effect. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.  
  Global Climate Change 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions consist primarily of CO   2    and result primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. In 2017, the Duke Energy Registrants  power plants emitted approximately 105 million tons of CO   2   . Future levels of CO   2    emissions will be influenced by variables that include fuel prices, compliance with new or existing regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand and the technologies deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet the customer demand. 
  
   82 

PART II 

The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO   2    emissions over time. Actions have included the retirement of 47 coal-fired EGUs with a combined generating capacity of 5,425 MW. Much of that capacity has been replaced with state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated. Duke Energy also has made investments to expand its portfolio of wind and solar projects, increase energy efficiency offerings and invest in its zero-CO   2    emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO   2    emissions. Between 2005 and 2017, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO   2    emissions from their electricity generation by more than 31 percent, which lowers the exposure to any future mandatory CO   2    emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement. Duke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently-available and commercially-demonstrated technology to reduce CO   2    emissions, including energy efficiency, wind, solar, storage, nuclear and carbon sequestration. Duke Energy will adjust to evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability that customers expect. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO   2    limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants  operations impossible. The Duke Energy Registrants have historically planned and prepared for extreme weather events, such as ice storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, high winds and droughts they occasionally experience. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants annually, biannually or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking  integrated resource plans  (IRPs). These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the company s thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction. 
  For a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price on CO   2    emissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential regulation of CO   2    emissions. Incorporating a price on CO   2    emissions in the IRP allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One of the challenges with using a CO   2    price, especially in the absence of a clear and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants typically use a range of potential CO   2    prices to reflect a range of potential policy outcomes. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems. The Duke Energy Registrants  electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on-site to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity.  
  North Carolina Legislation 
  In July 2017, the North Carolina General Assembly passed House Bill 589 and it was subsequently enacted into law by the governor. The law includes, among other things, overall reform of the application of Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) for new solar projects in the state, a requirement for the utility to procure approximately 2,600 MW of renewable energy through a competitive bidding process and recovery of costs related to the competitive bidding process through the fuel clause and a competitive procurement rider. The law stipulated certain deadlines for Duke Energy to file for NCUC approval of programs required under the law. Duke Energy has made some regulatory filings since the passage of the law and will continue to implement the requirements of House Bill 589.  
  Nuclear Matters 
  Following the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan, in March 2011, the NRC formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system. Subsequently, the NRC targeted a set of improvements designed to enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of NRC programs. Pursuant to the findings of the task force, in March 2012, the NRC issued three regulatory orders requiring safety enhancements related to mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at a plant, ensuring reliable hardened containment vents and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation. Duke Energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancements ordered by the NRC and has completed actions on two of the three NRC orders, as required. The remaining order is focused only on enhancements to boiling water reactor designs which, for Duke Energy, is unique to Brunswick Steam Electric Plant. Actions associated with this third order will be completed by March 2019. With the NRC s continuing review of this matter, Duke Energy cannot predict to what extent the NRC will impose additional licensing and safety-related requirements or the costs of complying with such requirements. Upon receipt of additional guidance from the NRC and a collaborative industry review, Duke Energy will be able to determine an implementation plan and associated costs. See Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  for further discussion of applicable risk factors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. 
  Opinion on the Financial Statements 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
  Basis for Opinion 
  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.

Index to Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements 
  The notes to the consolidated financial statements are a combined presentation. The following table indicates the registrants to which the notes apply.   

  Tables within the notes may not sum across due to (i) Progress Energy's consolidation of Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and other subsidiaries that are not registrants and (ii) subsidiaries that are not registrants but included in the consolidated Duke Energy balances. 
   
  1  . SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Nature of Operations and Basis of Consolidation 
  Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Duke Energy operates in the United States (U.S.) primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also subsidiary registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas); Progress Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy); Duke Energy Progress, LLC (Duke Energy Progress); Duke Energy Florida, LLC (Duke Energy Florida); Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio); Duke Energy Indiana, LLC (Duke Energy Indiana) and Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont). When discussing Duke Energy s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its seven separate subsidiary registrants (collectively referred to as the Subsidiary Registrants), which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants. 
  In October 2016, Duke Energy completed the acquisition of Piedmont. Duke Energy's consolidated financial statements include Piedmont's results of operations and cash flows activity subsequent to the acquisition date. Effective November 1, 2016, Piedmont's fiscal year-end was changed from October 31 to December 31, the year-end of Duke Energy. A transition report was filed on Form 10-Q (Form 10-QT) as of December 31, 2016, for the transition period from November 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. See Note   2   for additional information regarding the acquisition. 
  In December 2016, Duke Energy completed an exit of the Latin American market to focus on its domestic regulated business, which was further bolstered by the acquisition of Piedmont. The sale of the International Energy business segment, excluding an equity method investment in National Methanol Company (NMC), was completed through two transactions including a sale of assets in Brazil to China Three Gorges (Luxembourg) Energy S. .r.l. (CTG) and a sale of Duke Energy's remaining Latin American assets in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina to ISQ Enerlam Aggregator, L.P. and Enerlam (UK) Holding Ltd. (I Squared) (collectively, the International Disposal Group). See Note   2   for additional information on the sale of International Energy. 
  The information in these combined notes relates to each of the Duke Energy Registrants as noted in the Index to Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. However, none of the Subsidiary Registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself. 
  These Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of the Duke Energy Registrants and subsidiaries where the respective Duke Energy Registrants have control. These Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Duke Energy Registrants  proportionate share of certain jointly owned generation and transmission facilities. Substantially all of the Subsidiary Registrants' operations qualify for regulatory accounting.

Amounts Attributable to Controlling Interests 
  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Loss From Discontinued Operations, net of tax on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statement of Operations is entirely attributable to controlling interest. The following table presents Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation for continuing operations and discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015.   

  Significant Accounting Policies 
  Use of Estimates 
  In preparing financial statements that conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S., the Duke Energy Registrants must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Regulatory Accounting 
  The majority of the Duke Energy Registrants  operations are subject to price regulation for the sale of electricity and natural gas by state utility commissions or FERC. When prices are set on the basis of specific costs of the regulated operations and an effective franchise is in place such that sufficient natural gas or electric services can be sold to recover those costs, the Duke Energy Registrants apply regulatory accounting. Regulatory accounting changes the timing of the recognition of costs or revenues relative to a company that does not apply regulatory accounting. As a result, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related cost in the ratemaking process. See Note   4   for further information. 
  Regulatory accounting rules also require recognition of a disallowance (also called "impairment") loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. These disallowances can require judgments on allowed future rate recovery. 
  When it becomes probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value that may be retained as a regulatory asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an impairment charge could be partially or fully offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable. The impairment for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows. 
  Regulated Fuel and Purchased Gas Adjustment Clauses 
  The Duke Energy Registrants utilize cost-tracking mechanisms, commonly referred to as fuel adjustment clauses or purchased gas adjustment clauses (PGA). These clauses allow for the recovery of fuel and fuel-related costs, portions of purchased power, natural gas costs and hedging costs through surcharges on customer rates. The difference between the costs incurred and the surcharge revenues is recorded either as an adjustment to Operating Revenues, Operating Expenses   Fuel used in electric generation or Operating Expenses   Cost of natural gas on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with an off-setting impact on regulatory assets or liabilities. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents.  
  Restricted Cash 
  The Duke Energy Registrants have restricted cash related primarily to collateral assets, escrow deposits and variable interest entities (VIEs). Restricted cash balances are reflected in Other within Current Assets and in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , Duke Energy had restricted cash totaling   $147 million   and   $137 million  , respectively.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Inventory 
  Inventory is used for operations and is recorded primarily using the average cost method. Inventory related to regulated operations is valued at historical cost. Inventory related to nonregulated operations is valued at the lower of cost or market. Materials and supplies are recorded as inventory when purchased and subsequently charged to expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment when installed. Inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, is written-down to the lower of cost or market value. Once inventory has been written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. Provisions for inventory write-offs were not material at   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  . The components of inventory are presented in the tables below.   

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities 
  The Duke Energy Registrants classify investments into two categories   trading and available-for-sale. Both categories are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. For certain investments of regulated operations, such as substantially all of the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds (NDTF), realized and unrealized gains and losses (including any other-than-temporary impairments (OTTIs)) on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. Otherwise, unrealized gains and losses are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), unless other-than-temporarily impaired. OTTIs for equity securities and the credit loss portion of debt securities of nonregulated operations are included in earnings. Investments in debt and equity securities are classified as either current or noncurrent based on management s intent and ability to sell these securities, taking into consideration current market liquidity. See Note   15   for further information. 
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill 
  Effective with Piedmont's change in fiscal year end to December 31, as discussed above, Piedmont changed the date of its annual impairment testing of goodwill from October 31 to August 31 to align with the other Duke Energy Registrants. 
  Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont perform annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31 each year at the reporting unit level, which is determined to be an operating segment or one level below. Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont update these tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
  Intangible Assets 
  Intangible assets are included in Other in Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, intangible assets are amortized using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or on a straight-line basis if that pattern is not readily determinable. Amortization of intangibles is reflected in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and if impaired, the carrying value is accordingly reduced. 
  Emission allowances permit the holder of the allowance to emit certain gaseous byproducts of fossil fuel combustion, including sulfur dioxide (SO   2   ) and nitrogen oxide (NO   X   ). Allowances are issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at zero cost and may also be bought and sold via third-party transactions. Allowances allocated to or acquired by the Duke Energy Registrants are held primarily for consumption. Carrying amounts for emission allowances are based on the cost to acquire the allowances or, in the case of a business combination, on the fair value assigned in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired business. Emission allowances are expensed to Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Renewable energy certificates are used to measure compliance with renewable energy standards and are held primarily for consumption. See Note   11   for further information. 
  Long-Lived Asset Impairments 
  The Duke Energy Registrants evaluate long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when a long-lived asset s carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The estimated cash flows may be based on alternative expected outcomes that are probability weighted. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on these estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is written-down to its then-current estimated fair value and an impairment charge is recognized. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants assess fair value of long-lived assets using various methods, including recent comparable third-party sales, internally developed discounted cash flow analysis and analysis from outside advisors. Triggering events to reassess cash flows may include, but are not limited to, significant changes in commodity prices, the condition of an asset or management s interest in selling the asset. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of depreciated historical cost net of any disallowances or fair value, if impaired. The Duke Energy Registrants capitalize all construction-related direct labor and material costs, as well as indirect construction costs such as general engineering, taxes and financing costs. See  Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized  for information on capitalized financing costs. Costs of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are also capitalized. The cost of repairs, replacements and major maintenance projects, which do not extend the useful life or increase the expected output of the asset, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is generally computed over the estimated useful life of the asset using the composite straight-line method. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update composite rates and are approved by state utility commissions and/or the FERC when required. The composite weighted average depreciation rates, excluding nuclear fuel, are included in the table that follows.   

   In general, when the Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, plant and equipment, the original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable the asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the net amount is classified as Generation facilities to be retired, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset is no longer operating, the net amount is classified in Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets if deemed recoverable (see discussion of long-lived asset impairments above). When it becomes probable an asset will be abandoned, the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation is reclassified to Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for amounts recoverable in rates. The carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are allowed to recover the remaining net book value and a return equal to at least the incremental borrowing rate. If not, an impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate. 
  When the Duke Energy Registrants sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed from Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body. 
  See Note   10   for further information. 
  Nuclear Fuel 
  Nuclear fuel is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, except for Duke Energy Florida. Nuclear fuel amounts at Duke Energy Florida were reclassified to Regulatory assets pursuant to the Revised and Restated Stipulation and Settlement Agreement approved in November 2013 among Duke Energy Florida, the Florida Office of Public Counsel (Florida OPC) and other customer advocates (the 2013 Settlement).

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Nuclear fuel in the front-end fuel processing phase is considered work in progress and not amortized until placed in service. Amortization of nuclear fuel is included within Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization is recorded using the units-of-production method. 
  Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized 
  For regulated operations, the debt and equity costs of financing the construction of property, plant and equipment are reflected as AFUDC and capitalized as a component of the cost of property, plant and equipment. AFUDC equity is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as non-cash income in Other income and expenses, net. AFUDC debt is reported as a non-cash offset to Interest Expense. After construction is completed, the Duke Energy Registrants are permitted to recover these costs through their inclusion in rate base and the corresponding subsequent depreciation or amortization of those regulated assets. 
  AFUDC equity, a permanent difference for income taxes, reduces the effective tax rate (ETR) when capitalized and increases the ETR when depreciated or amortized. See Note   22   for additional information. 
  For nonregulated operations, interest is capitalized during the construction phase with an offsetting non-cash credit to Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Asset Retirement Obligations 
  Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Substantially all AROs are related to regulated operations. When recording an ARO, the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. For operating plants, the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. For retired plants, the present value of the liability is recorded as a regulatory asset unless determined not to be recoverable. 
  The present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the ARO for regulated operations through a combination of regulated revenues and earnings on the NDTF. As a result, amounts recovered in regulated revenues, earnings on the NDTF, accretion expense and depreciation of the associated asset are netted and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. 
  Obligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. Duke Energy Florida assumes Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Plant (Crystal River Unit 3) will be placed into a safe storage configuration until eventual dismantlement is completed by 2074. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility. 
  Obligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans, if known, or probability weightings of the potential closure methods if the closure plans are under development and multiple closure options are being considered and evaluated on a site-by-site basis. See Note   9   for additional information. 
  Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenue 
  Revenues on sales of electricity and natural gas are recognized when service is provided or the product is delivered. Unbilled revenues are recognized by applying customer billing rates to the estimated volumes of energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer mix, average price in effect for customer classes, timing of rendering customer bills and meter reading schedules, and the impact of weather normalization or margin decoupling mechanisms. 
  Unbilled revenues are included within Receivables and Receivables of VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as shown in the following table.

Additionally, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell, on a revolving basis, nearly all of their retail accounts receivable, including receivables for unbilled revenues, to an affiliate, Cinergy Receivables Company LLC (CRC) and account for the transfers of receivables as sales. Accordingly, the receivables sold are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note   17   for further information. These receivables for unbilled revenues are shown in the table below.   

  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  Allowances for doubtful accounts are presented in the following table.   

  (a)    Piedmont's allowance for doubtful accounts was   $2 million   as of October 31, 2016, and 2015. 
  Derivatives and Hedging 
  Derivative and non-derivative instruments may be used in connection with commodity price and interest rate activities, including swaps, futures, forwards and options. All derivative instruments, except those that qualify for the normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS) exception, are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Qualifying derivative instruments may be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Other derivative instruments (undesignated contracts) either have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a fair value hedge is offset in net income by changes in the hedged item. For activity subject to regulatory accounting, gains and losses on derivative contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities and not as other comprehensive income or current period income. As a result, changes in fair value of these derivatives have no immediate earnings impact. 
  Formal documentation, including transaction type and risk management strategy, is maintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and at least every three months thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if it is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. 
  See Note   14   for further information. 
  Captive Insurance Reserves 
  Duke Energy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on an indemnity basis, to the Subsidiary Registrants as well as certain third parties, on a limited basis, for financial losses, primarily related to property, workers  compensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR), as well as estimated provisions for known claims. IBNR reserve estimates are primarily based upon historical loss experience, industry data and other actuarial assumptions. Reserve estimates are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from experience. 
  Duke Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization is deemed probable.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount and Expense 
  Premiums, discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt are amortized over the term of the debt issue. The gain or loss on extinguishment associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations in the regulated operations is amortized. Amortization expense is recorded as Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and is reflected as Depreciation, amortization and accretion within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Premiums, discounts and expenses are presented as an adjustment to the carrying value of the debt amount and included in Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented. 
  Loss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities 
  Contingent losses are recorded when it is probable a loss has occurred and can be reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred. 
  Environmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental remediation or other liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental expenditures related to past operations that do not generate current or future revenues are expensed. Environmental expenditures related to operations that generate current or future revenues are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Certain environmental expenditures receive regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded as regulatory assets. 
  See Notes   4   and   5   for further information. 
  Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 
  Duke Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in the respective qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans and the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of benefit costs. See Note   21   for further information, including significant accounting policies associated with these plans. 
  Severance and Special Termination Benefits 
  Duke Energy has severance plans under which, in general, the longer a terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of severance benefits. A liability for involuntary severance is recorded once an involuntary severance plan is committed to by management if involuntary severances are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For involuntary severance benefits incremental to its ongoing severance plan benefits, the fair value of the obligation is expensed at the communication date if there are no future service requirements or over the required future service period. From time to time, Duke Energy offers special termination benefits under voluntary severance programs. Special termination benefits are recorded immediately upon employee acceptance absent a significant retention period. Otherwise, the cost is recorded over the remaining service period. Employee acceptance of voluntary severance benefits is determined by management based on the facts and circumstances of the benefits being offered. See Note   19   for further information. 
  Guarantees 
  If necessary, liabilities are recognized at the time of issuance or material modification of a guarantee for the estimated fair value of the obligation it assumes. Fair value is estimated using a probability-weighted approach. The obligation is reduced over the term of the guarantee or related contract in a systematic and rational method as risk is reduced. Any additional contingent loss for guarantee contracts subsequent to the initial recognition of a liability is accounted for and recognized at the time a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Note   7   for further information. 
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  Stock-based compensation represents costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees and Duke Energy Board of Directors (Board of Directors) members. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures at the date of issuance. The recognition period for these costs begins at either the applicable service inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite service period. Compensation cost is recognized as expense or capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. See Note   20   for further information. 
  Income Taxes 
  Duke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and foreign jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants are parties to a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. Investment tax credits (ITCs) associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties. 
  Accumulated deferred income taxes are valued using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. In the event of a change in tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured as of the enactment date of the new rate. To the extent that the change in the value of the deferred tax represents an obligation to customers, the impact of the remeasurement is deferred to a regulatory liability. Remaining impacts are recorded in income from continuing operations. Other impacts of the Tax Act have been recorded on a provisional basis, see Note 22,  Income Taxes,  for additional information. If Duke Energy's estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is not reflective of actual outcomes, is modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal then Duke Energy's results of operations could be impacted.

Tax-related interest and penalties are recorded in Interest Expense and Other Income and Expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  See Note   22   for further information. 
  Accounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits 
  When Duke Energy receives ITCs on wind or solar facilities, it reduces the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the amount of the ITC and, therefore, the ITC benefit is ultimately recognized in the statement of operations through reduced depreciation expense. Additionally, certain tax credits and government grants result in an initial tax depreciable base in excess of the book carrying value by an amount equal to one half of the ITC. Deferred tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period that the basis difference is created. 
  Excise Taxes 
  Certain excise taxes levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis. Otherwise, the taxes are accounted for net. Excise taxes accounted for on a gross basis within both Operating Revenues and Property and other taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows.   

   Dividend Restrictions and Unappropriated Retained Earnings 
  Duke Energy does not have any legal, regulatory or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders. However, as further described in Note   4  , due to conditions established by regulators in conjunction with merger transaction approvals, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont have restrictions on paying dividends or otherwise advancing funds to Duke Energy. At   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , an insignificant amount of Duke Energy s consolidated Retained earnings balance represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments. 
  New Accounting Standards 
  The new accounting standards adopted for 2017 and 2016 had no material impact on the presentation or results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Duke Energy Registrants. The following accounting standards were adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants during 2017. 
  Stock-Based Compensation and Income Taxes.   In first quarter 2017, Duke Energy adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance, which revised the accounting for stock-based compensation and the associated income taxes. The adopted guidance changed certain aspects of accounting for stock-based payment awards to employees including the accounting for income taxes and classification on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The primary impact to Duke Energy as a result of implementing this guidance was a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for tax benefits not previously recognized and additional income tax expense for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017. See the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for further information. 
  Goodwill Impairment.   In January 2017, the FASB issued revised guidance for the subsequent measurement of goodwill. Under the guidance, a company will recognize an impairment to goodwill for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Duke Energy early adopted this guidance for the 2017 annual goodwill impairment test. 
  The following new accounting standards have been issued, but have not yet been adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants, as of   December 31, 2017  . 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . In May 2014, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Duke Energy has identified material revenue streams, which served as the basis for accounting analysis and documentation of the impact of this guidance on revenue recognition. The accounting analysis included reviewing representative contracts and tariffs for each material revenue stream. Most of Duke Energy s revenue will be in scope of the new guidance. The majority of our sales, including energy provided to residential customers, are from tariff offerings that provide natural gas or electricity without a defined contractual term ("at-will"). For such arrangements, revenue from contracts with customers will be equivalent to the electricity or natural gas supplied and billed in that period (including estimated billings). As such, there will not be a significant shift in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for such sales.  
  Also included in the accounting analysis was the evaluation of certain long-term revenue streams including electric wholesale contracts and renewables power purchase agreements (PPAs). For such arrangements, Duke Energy does not expect material changes to the pattern of revenue recognition on the registrants. In addition, Duke Energy has monitored the activities of the power and utilities industry revenue recognition task force including draft accounting positions released in October 2017 and the impact, if any, on Duke Energy s specific contracts and conclusions. Potential revisions to processes, policies and controls, primarily related to evaluating supplemental disclosures required as a result of adopting this guidance, will be evaluated and implemented as necessary. Some revenue arrangements, such as alternative revenue programs and certain PPAs accounted for as leases, are excluded from the scope of the new revenue recognition guidance and, therefore, will be accounted for and evaluated for separate presentation and disclosure under other relevant accounting guidance. 
  Duke Energy intends to use the modified retrospective method of adoption effective January 1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method of adoption, prior year reported results are not restated and a cumulative-effect adjustment, if applicable, is recorded to retained earnings at January 1, 2018, as if the standard had always been in effect. In addition, disclosures, if applicable, include a comparison to what would have been reported for 2018 under the previous revenue recognition rules to assist financial statement users in understanding how revenue recognition has changed as a result of this standard and to facilitate comparability with prior year reported results, which are not restated under the modified retrospective approach as described above. Duke Energy will utilize certain practical expedients including applying this guidance to open contracts at the date of adoption and recognizing revenues for certain contracts under the invoice practical expedient, which allows revenue recognition to be consistent with invoiced amounts (including estimated billings) provided certain criteria are met, including consideration of whether the invoiced amounts reasonably represent the value provided to customers. While the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on either the timing or amount of revenues recognized in Duke Energy's financial statements, Duke Energy anticipates additional disclosures around the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Duke Energy continues to evaluate what information will be most useful for users of the financial statements, including information already provided in disclosures outside of the financial statement footnotes. These additional disclosures are expected to include the disaggregation of revenues by customer class.  
  Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement.   In January 2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes in the fair value of all equity securities will be required to be recorded in net income. Current GAAP allows some changes in fair value for available-for-sale equity securities to be recorded in AOCI. Additional disclosures will be required to present separately the financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset. An entity's equity investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting are not included within the scope of the new guidance. 
  For Duke Energy, the revised accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018, by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. This guidance is expected to have minimal impact on the Duke Energy Registrant's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as changes in the fair value of most of the Duke Energy Registrants' available-for-sale equity securities are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities pursuant to accounting guidance for regulated operations. 
  Leases.   In February 2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for leases. The core principle of this guidance is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. 
  For Duke Energy, this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019. The guidance is applied using a modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, Duke Energy expects to elect the practical expedients, which would require no reassessment of whether existing contracts are or contain leases as well as no reassessment of lease classification for existing leases. Additionally, we expect to adopt the optional transition practical expedient allowing the entity not to reassess the accounting for land easements that currently exist at the adoption of the lease standard on January 1, 2019. Duke Energy is currently evaluating the financial statement impact of adopting this standard and is continuing to monitor industry implementation issues, including easements, pole attachments and renewable PPAs. Other than an expected increase in assets and liabilities, the ultimate impact of the new standard has not yet been determined. Significant system enhancements, including additional processes and controls, will be required to facilitate the identification, tracking and reporting of potential leases based upon requirements of the new lease standard. Duke Energy has begun the implementation of a third-party software tool to help with the adoption and ongoing accounting under the new standard.  
  Statement of Cash Flows.   In November 2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance to reduce diversity in practice for the presentation and classification of restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. Under the updated guidance, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents will be included within beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. 
  For Duke Energy, this guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. The guidance will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Upon adoption by Duke Energy, the revised guidance will result in a change to the amount of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash explained when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to adoption, the Duke Energy Registrants reflect changes in restricted cash within Cash Flows from Investing Activities and within Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As a result of this change, our Cash and cash equivalents balance on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as of December 31, 2017 will change by   $147 million  .

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Retirement Benefits.   In March 2017, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for the presentation of net periodic costs related to benefit plans. Current GAAP permits the aggregation of all the components of net periodic costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and does not require the disclosure of the location of net periodic costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under the amended guidance, the service cost component of net periodic costs must be included within Operating Income within the same line as other compensation expenses. All other components of net periodic costs must be outside of Operating Income. In addition, the updated guidance permits only the service cost component of net periodic costs to be capitalized to Inventory or Property, Plant and Equipment. This represents a change from current GAAP, which permits all components of net periodic costs to be capitalized. These amendments should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the various components of net periodic costs and prospectively for the change in eligible costs to be capitalized. The guidance allows for a practical expedient that permits a company to use amounts disclosed in prior-period financial statements as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. 
  For Duke Energy, this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. Duke Energy currently presents the total non-capitalized net periodic costs within Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The adoption of this guidance will result in a retrospective change to reclassify the presentation of the non-service cost (benefit) components of net periodic costs to Other income and expenses. Duke Energy intends to utilize the practical expedient for retrospective presentation. The change in net periodic costs eligible for capitalization is applicable prospectively. Since Duke Energy s service cost component is expected to be greater than the total net periodic costs, the change will result in increased capitalization of net periodic costs, higher Operation, maintenance and other and higher Other income and expenses. The resulting impact to Duke Energy is expected to be an immaterial increase in Net Income resulting from the limitation of eligible capitalization of net periodic costs to the service cost component, which is larger than the total net periodic costs.  
   
  2  . ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  
  ACQUISITIONS 
  The Duke Energy Registrants consolidate assets and liabilities from acquisitions as of the purchase date and include earnings from acquisitions in consolidated earnings after the purchase date. 
  2016 Acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas 
  On October 3, 2016, Duke Energy acquired all outstanding common stock of Piedmont for a total cash purchase price of   $5.0 billion   and assumed Piedmont's existing long-term debt, which had a fair value of approximately   $2.0 billion   at the time of the acquisition. The acquisition provides a foundation for Duke Energy to establish a broader, long-term strategic natural gas infrastructure platform to complement its existing natural gas pipeline investments and regulated natural gas business in the Midwest. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Piedmont became a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. 
  Purchase Price Allocation 
  The purchase price allocation of the Piedmont acquisition is as follows:   

  The fair value of Piedmont's assets and liabilities was determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows and market prices of long-term debt. 
  The majority of Piedmont s operations are subject to the rate-setting authority of the NCUC, the PSCSC and the TPUC and are accounted for pursuant to accounting guidance for regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost recovery provisions currently in place for Piedmont s regulated operations provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base. Thus, the fair value of Piedmont's assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximates the pre-acquisition carrying values and does not reflect any net valuation adjustments. 
  The significant assets and liabilities for which valuation adjustments were reflected within the purchase price allocation include the acquired equity method investments and long-term debt. The difference between the fair value and the pre-merger carrying values of long-term debt for regulated operations was recorded as a regulatory asset.  
  The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Piedmont's assets and liabilities on the acquisition date was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill reflects the value paid by Duke Energy primarily for establishing a broader, long-term strategic natural gas infrastructure growth platform, an improved risk profile and expected synergies resulting from the combined entities.

Under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, Duke Energy elected not to apply push down accounting to the stand-alone Piedmont financial statements. 
  Accounting Charges Related to the Acquisition 
  Duke Energy incurred pretax non-recurring transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of   $103 million  ,   $439 million   and   $9 million   for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amounts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2017 were primarily system integration costs of   $71 million   related to combining the various operational and financial systems of Duke Energy and Piedmont, including a one-time software impairment resulting from planned accounting system and process integration. A   $7 million   charge was recorded within Impairment Charges, with the remaining   $64 million   recorded within Operation, maintenance and other.  
  Amounts recorded in 2016 include: 
             
    Interest expense of   $234 million   related to the acquisition financing, including realized losses on forward-starting interest rate swaps of   $190 million  . See Note   14   for additional information on the swaps. 
                
    Charges of   $104 million   related to commitments made in conjunction with the transaction, including charitable contributions and a one-time bill credit to Piedmont customers.   $10 million   was recorded as a reduction in Operating Revenues, with the remaining   $94 million   recorded within Operation, maintenance and other. 
                
    Other transaction and integration costs of   $101 million   recorded to Operation, maintenance and other, including professional fees and severance.

DISPOSITIONS 
  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, was immaterial. The following table summarizes the (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax recorded on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015:   

           (a) 
    Relates to previously sold businesses not related to the Disposal Groups. The amount for 2016 represents an income tax benefit resulting from immaterial out of period deferred tax liability adjustments. The amount for 2015 includes indemnifications provided for certain legal, tax and environmental matters and foreign currency translation adjustments.  
     2016 Sale of International Energy 
  In February 2016, Duke Energy announced it had initiated a process to divest its International Energy businesses, excluding the equity method investment in NMC (the International Disposal Group), and in October 2016, announced it had entered into two separate purchase and sale agreements to execute the divestiture. Both sales closed in December of 2016, resulting in available cash proceeds of   $1.9 billion  , excluding transaction costs. Proceeds were primarily used to reduce Duke Energy holding company (the parent) debt. Existing favorable tax attributes result in no immediate U.S. federal-level cash tax impacts. Details of each transaction are as follows: 
             
    On December 20, 2016, Duke Energy closed on the sale of its ownership interests in businesses in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and Peru to I Squared Capital. The assets sold included approximately   2,230   MW of hydroelectric and natural gas generation capacity, transmission infrastructure and natural gas processing facilities. I Squared Capital purchased the businesses for an enterprise value of   $1.2 billion  .  
                
    On December 29, 2016, Duke Energy closed on the sale of its Brazilian business, which included approximately   2,090   MW of hydroelectric generation capacity, to CTG for an enterprise value of   $1.2 billion  . With the closing of the CTG deal, Duke Energy finalized its exit from the Latin American market. 
     Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations 
  As a result of the transactions, the International Disposal Group was classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense directly associated with the International Disposal Group was allocated to discontinued operations. No interest from corporate level debt was allocated to discontinued operations.

(a) 
    Upon meeting the criteria for assets held for sale, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 depreciation expense was ceased. 
              (b) 
    In conjunction with the advancements of marketing efforts during 2016, Duke Energy performed recoverability tests of the long-lived asset groups of International Energy. As a result, Duke Energy determined the carrying value of certain assets in Central America was not fully recoverable and recorded a pretax impairment charge of   $194 million  . The charge represents the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the assets, which was based on a Level 3 Fair Value measurement that was primarily determined from the income approach using discounted cash flows but also considered market information obtained in 2016. 
              (c) 
    The pretax loss on disposal includes the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses of   $620 million   as of the disposal date. See the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for additional information. 
               (e) 
    2016 amount includes   $126 million   of income tax expense on the disposal, which primarily reflects in-country taxes incurred as a result of the sale. The after-tax loss on disposal was   $640 million  . 
              (f) 
    2016 amount includes an income tax benefit of   $95 million  . See Note   22  , "Income Taxes," for additional information. 
     Duke Energy has elected not to separately disclose discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table summarizes Duke Energy's cash flows from discontinued operations related to the International Disposal Group.   

  Other Sale Related Matters 
  During 2017, Duke Energy provided certain transition services to CTG and I Squared Capital. Cash flows related to providing the transition services were not material as of December 31, 2017. All transition services related to the International Disposal Group ended in 2017. Additionally, Duke Energy will reimburse CTG and I Squared Capital for all tax obligations arising from the period preceding consummation on the transactions, totaling approximately   $78 million  . Duke Energy has not recorded any other liabilities, contingent liabilities or indemnifications related to the International Disposal Group.  
  2015 Midwest Generation Exit 
  Duke Energy, through indirect subsidiaries, completed the sale of the Midwest Generation Disposal Group to a subsidiary of Dynegy on April 2, 2015, for approximately   $2.8 billion   in cash. The nonregulated Midwest generation business included generation facilities with approximately   5,900   MW of owned capacity located in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois. On April 1, 2015, prior to the sale, Duke Energy Ohio distributed its indirect ownership interest in the nonregulated Midwest generation business to a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation.  
  Duke Energy utilized a revolving credit agreement (RCA) to support the operations of the nonregulated Midwest generation business. Duke Energy Ohio had a power purchase agreement with the Midwest Generation Disposal Group for a portion of its standard service offer (SSO) supply requirement. The agreement and the SSO expired in May 2015.  
  The results of operations of the Midwest Generation Disposal Group prior to the date of sale are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest expense associated with the RCA was allocated to discontinued operations. No other interest expense related to corporate level debt was allocated to discontinued operations. Certain immaterial costs that were eliminated as a result of the sale remained in continuing operations. The following table summarizes the Midwest Generation Disposal Group activity recorded within discontinued operations.   

           (a) 
    The Loss on disposal includes impairments recorded to adjust the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated fair value of the business, based on the selling price to Dynegy less cost to sell. 
              (b) 
    2015 amounts include the impact of an   $81 million   charge for the settlement agreement reached in a lawsuit related to the Midwest Generation Disposal Group. Refer to Note 5 for further information about the lawsuit. 
              (c) 
    2016 amounts result from immaterial out of period deferred tax liability adjustments.

All Registrants 
  Tax Act Impacts 
  On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law, which, among other provisions, reduces the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the Tax Act, the Subsidiary Registrants revalued their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as of December 31, 2017, to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred tax amounts. For the Subsidiary Registrants regulated operations, where the reduction is expected to be accounted for and applied to customers  rates in future commission proceedings, including rate proceedings, the net remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. Each of the Subsidiary Registrant's regulatory commissions is reviewing the Tax Act to determine the potential impacts on customer rates. Beginning in January 2018, the Subsidiary Registrants will defer the estimated ongoing impacts of the Tax Act that are expected to be returned to customers. See Note   22   for additional information. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
  Ash Basin Closure Costs Deferral 
  On December 30, 2016, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a joint petition with the NCUC seeking an accounting order authorizing deferral of certain costs incurred in connection with federal and state environmental remediation requirements related to the permanent closure of ash basins and other ash storage units at coal-fired generating facilities that have provided or are providing generation to customers located in North Carolina. Initial comments were received in March 2017, and reply comments were filed on April 19, 2017. The NCUC has consolidated Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress  coal ash deferral requests into their respective general rate case dockets for decision. See "2017 North Carolina Rate Case" sections below for additional discussion. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

     2017 North Carolina Rate Case 
  On August 25, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately   $647 million  , which represents an approximate   13.6 percent   increase in annual base revenues. The rate increase is driven by capital investments subsequent to the previous base rate case, including grid improvement projects, AMI, investments in customer service technologies, costs of complying with coal combustion residuals (CCR) regulations and the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) and recovery of costs related to licensing and development of the William States Lee III Nuclear Station (Lee Nuclear Station) discussed below. On January 23, 2018, the North Carolina Public Staff filed testimony recommending an overall rate decrease of approximately   $290 million  . An evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on February 27, 2018, and a decision and revised customer rates are expected by mid-2018. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  FERC Formula Rate Matter 
  On July 31, 2017, Piedmont Municipal Power Agency (PMPA) filed a complaint with FERC against Duke Energy Carolinas alleging that Duke Energy Carolinas misapplied the formula rate under the purchase power agreement (PPA) between the parties by including regulatory amortization in its rates without FERC approval. Duke Energy Carolinas disagreed with PMPA as it believed it was properly applying its FERC filed rate. On February 15, 2018, FERC issued an order ruling in favor of PMPA and ordered Duke Energy Carolinas to refund to PMPA all amounts improperly collected under the PPA. Resolution of this matter is not expected to be material. 
  Lincoln County Combustion Turbine  
  On December 7, 2017, the NCUC issued an order approving a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) for Duke Energy Carolinas' proposed 402-megawatt (MW) simple cycle, advanced combustion turbine natural gas-fueled electric generating unit at its existing Lincoln County site. The CPCN also includes construction of related transmission and natural gas pipeline interconnection facilities. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2018 with an extended commissioning and validation period from 2020-2024 and an estimated commercial operation date in 2024. As a condition of the approval, Duke Energy Carolinas will not seek recovery of costs associated with the project until it is placed into commercial operation.  
  Advanced Metering Infrastructure Deferral 
  On July 12, 2016, the PSCSC issued an accounting order for Duke Energy Carolinas to defer the financial effects of depreciation expense incurred for the installation of AMI meters, the carrying costs on the investment at its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the carrying costs on the deferred costs at its WACC not to exceed   $45 million  . The decision also allows Duke Energy Carolinas to continue to depreciate the non-AMI meters to be replaced. Current retail rates will not change as a result of the decision and the ability of interested parties to challenge the reasonableness of expenditures in subsequent proceedings is not limited.  
  William States Lee Combined Cycle Facility 
  On April 9, 2014, the PSCSC granted Duke Energy Carolinas and North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC) a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity (CECPCN) for the construction and operation of a 750-MW combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating plant at Duke Energy Carolinas' existing William States Lee Generating Station in Anderson, South Carolina. Duke Energy Carolinas began construction in July 2015 and estimates a cost to build of   $600 million   for its share of the facility, including allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). The project is expected to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2018. NCEMC will own approximately   13 percent   of the project. On July 3, 2014, the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League (SCCL) and Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) jointly filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeals of South Carolina (S.C. Court of Appeals) seeking the court's review of the PSCSC's decision, claiming the PSCSC did not properly consider a request related to a proposed solar facility prior to granting approval of the CECPCN. The S.C. Court of Appeals affirmed the PSCSC's decision on February 10, 2016, and on March 24, 2016, denied a request for rehearing filed by SCCL and SACE. On April 21, 2016, SCCL and SACE petitioned the South Carolina Supreme Court for review of the S.C. Court of Appeals decision. On March 24, 2017, the South Carolina Supreme Court denied the request for review, thus concluding the matter.  
  Lee Nuclear Station 
  In December 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas applied to the NRC for combined operating licenses (COLs) for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors for the proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station to be located at a site in Cherokee County, South Carolina. The NCUC and PSCSC concurred with the prudency of Duke Energy Carolinas incurring certain project development and preconstruction costs through several separately issued orders, although full cost recovery is not guaranteed. In December 2016, the NRC issued a COL for each reactor. Duke Energy Carolinas is not required to build the nuclear reactors as result of the COLs being issued.

2017 North Carolina Rate Case 
  On June 1, 2017, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately   $477 million  , which represented an approximate   14.9 percent   increase in annual base revenues. Subsequent to the filing, Duke Energy Progress adjusted the requested amount to   $420 million  , representing an approximate   13 percent   increase. The rate increase is driven by capital investments subsequent to the previous base rate case, costs of complying with CCR regulations and the Coal Ash Act, costs relating to storm recovery, investments in customer service technologies and recovery of costs associated with renewable purchased power. On November 22, 2017, Duke Energy Progress and the North Carolina Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement resolving certain portions of the proceeding, pending NCUC approval. Terms of the settlement include a return on equity of   9.9 percent   and a capital structure of   52 percent   equity and   48 percent   debt. As a result of the settlement, in 2017 Duke Energy Progress recorded pretax charges totaling approximately   $25 million   to Impairment charges and Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Income Statements, principally related to disallowances from rate base of certain projects at the Mayo and Sutton plants. The settlement does not include agreement on portions of the rate case relating to recovery of deferred storm recovery costs and coal ash basin deferred costs, which will be decided by the NCUC separately. Taking into consideration the settled portions and Duke Energy Progress  requested recovery of the non-settled portions, the requested rate increase is reduced to approximately   $300 million  . An evidentiary hearing ended December 7, 2017, and a decision and revised customer rates are expected in the first quarter of 2018. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  Storm Cost Deferral Filings 
  On December 16, 2016, Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the NCUC requesting an accounting order to defer certain costs incurred in connection with response to Hurricane Matthew and other significant storms in 2016. The final estimate of incremental operation and maintenance and capital costs of   $116 million   was filed with the NCUC in September 2017. On March 15, 2017, the NCUC Public Staff filed comments supporting deferral of a portion of Duke Energy Progress  requested amount. Duke Energy Progress filed reply comments on April 12, 2017. On July 10, 2017, the NCUC consolidated Duke Energy Progress' storm deferral request into the Duke Energy Progress rate case docket for decision. See "2017 North Carolina Rate Case" for additional discussion. As of December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Progress has approximately   $77 million   included in Regulatory assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  On December 16, 2016, Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the PSCSC requesting an accounting order to defer certain costs incurred related to repairs and restoration of service following Hurricane Matthew. The final estimate of incremental operation and maintenance and capital costs was approximately   $74 million  . In January 2017, the PSCSC approved the deferral request and issued an accounting order. As of December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Progress has approximately   $73 million   included in Regulatory assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  South Carolina Rate Case 
  In December 2016, the PSCSC approved a rate case settlement agreement among the ORS (Office of Regulatory Staff), intervenors and Duke Energy Progress. Terms of the settlement agreement included an approximate   $56 million   increase in revenues over a two-year period. An increase of approximately   $38 million   in revenues was effective January 1, 2017, and an additional increase of approximately   $18.5 million   in revenues was effective January 1, 2018. Duke Energy Progress amortized approximately   $18.5 million   from the cost of removal reserve in 2017. Other settlement terms included a rate of return on equity of   10.1 percent  , recovery of coal ash costs incurred from January 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016, over a   15   year period and ongoing deferral of allocated ash basin closure costs from July 1, 2016, until the next base rate case. The settlement also provides that Duke Energy Progress will not seek an increase in rates in South Carolina to occur prior to 2019, with limited exceptions.  
  Western Carolinas Modernization Plan 
  On November 4, 2015, Duke Energy Progress announced a Western Carolinas Modernization Plan, which included retirement of the existing Asheville coal-fired plant, the construction of two 280     MW combined-cycle natural gas plants having dual fuel capability, with the option to build a third natural gas simple cycle unit in 2023 based upon the outcome of initiatives to reduce the region's power demand. The plan also included upgrades to existing transmission lines and substations, installation of solar generation and a pilot battery storage project. These investments will be made within the next seven years. Duke Energy Progress is also working with the local natural gas distribution company to upgrade an existing natural gas pipeline to serve the natural gas plant. 
  On March 28, 2016, the NCUC issued an order approving a CPCN for the new combined-cycle natural gas plants, but denying the CPCN for the contingent simple cycle unit without prejudice to Duke Energy Progress to refile for approval in the future. On March 28, 2017, Duke Energy Progress filed an annual progress report for the construction of the combined-cycle plants with the NCUC, with an estimated cost of   $893 million  . Site preparation activities for the combined-cycle plants are underway and construction of these plants began in 2017, with an expected in-service date in late 2019. Duke Energy Progress plans to file for future approvals related to the proposed solar generation and pilot battery storage project.  
  The carrying value of the   376  -MW Asheville coal-fired plant, including associated ash basin closure costs, of   $385 million   and   $492 million   are included in Generation facilities to be retired, net on Duke Energy Progress' Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , respectively.

Storm Restoration Cost Recovery 
  In September 2017, Duke Energy Florida s service territory suffered significant damage from Hurricane Irma, resulting in approximately   1.3 million   customers experiencing outages. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Duke Energy Florida also incurred preparation costs related to Hurricane Nate. On December 28, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC to recover incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricanes Irma and Nate and to replenish the storm reserve. The estimated recovery amount is approximately   $513 million   to be recovered over a three-year period beginning in March 2018, subject to true up, which includes reestablishment of a   $132 million   storm reserve. At December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Florida's Consolidated Balance Sheets included approximately   $376 million   of recoverable costs under the FPSC's storm rule in Regulatory assets within Other Noncurrent Assets related to storm recovery. On February 6, 2018, the FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida's motion to approve a stipulation that would apply tax savings resulting from the Tax Act toward storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge.  
  2017 Second Revised and Restated Settlement Agreement 
  On November 20, 2017, the FPSC issued an order to approve the 2017 Second Revised and Restated Settlement Agreement (2017 Settlement) filed by Duke Energy Florida. The 2017 Settlement replaces and supplants the 2013 Settlement. The 2017 Settlement extends the base rate case stay-out provision from the 2013 Settlement through the end of 2021 unless actual or projected return on equity falls below   9.5 percent  ; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed a multiyear increase to its base rates of   $67 million   per year in 2019, 2020 and 2021, as well as base rate increases for solar generation. In addition to carrying forward the provisions contained in the 2013 Settlement related to the Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units discussed below and future generation needs in Florida, the 2017 Settlement contains provisions related to future investments in solar and renewable energy technology, future investments in AMI technology as well as recovery of existing meters, impacts of the Tax Act, an electric vehicle charging station pilot program and the termination of the proposed Levy Nuclear Project discussed below. As part of the 2017 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will not move forward with building the Levy nuclear plant and recorded a pretax impairment charge of approximately   $135 million   in 2017 to write off all unrecovered Levy Nuclear Project costs, including the COL. As a result of the 2017 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida transferred   $75 million   to a regulatory asset for the net book value of existing meter technology, which will be recovered over a   15  -year period. 
  The 2017 Settlement includes provisions to recover 2017 under-recovered fuel costs of approximately   $196 million   over a   24  -month period beginning in January 2018. On September 1, 2017, Duke Energy Florida submitted Alternate 2018 Fuel and Capacity clause projection filings consistent with the terms of the 2017 Settlement. The updated capacity filing reflects the removal of all Levy costs. The FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida's 2018 Alternate projection filings on October 25, 2017. 
  Hines Chiller Uprate Project 
  On February 2, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition seeking approval to include in base rates the revenue requirement for a Chiller Uprate Project (Uprate Project) at the Hines Energy Complex. The Uprate Project was placed into service in March 2017 at a cost of approximately   $150 million  . The annual retail revenue requirement is approximately   $19 million  . On March 28, 2017, the FPSC issued an order approving the revenue requirement, which was included in base rates for the first billing cycle of April 2017. 
  Citrus County Combined Cycle Facility 
  On October 2, 2014, the FPSC granted Duke Energy Florida a Determination of Need for the construction of a 1,640-MW combined-cycle natural gas plant in Citrus County, Florida. On May 5, 2015, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection approved Duke Energy Florida's Site Certification Application. The project has received all required permits and approvals and construction began in October 2015. The facility is expected to be commercially available in 2018 at an estimated cost of   $1.5 billion  , including AFUDC. The plant will receive natural gas from the Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail) pipeline discussed below.  
  Purchase of Osprey Energy Center 
  Duke Energy Florida received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice (DOJ) related to alleged violation of the waiting period for the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 related to the purchase of the Osprey Energy Center, LLC, which was completed in January 2017. The DOJ alleged Duke Energy Florida assumed operational control of the Osprey Plant before the waiting period expiration on February 27, 2015. On January 17, 2017, Duke Energy Florida entered into a stipulation agreement to settle with the DOJ for   $600,000   without admission of liability. On January 18, 2017, the DOJ filed a complaint and the stipulation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was approved by the court. A final order dismissing the case was entered in April 2017.  
  Crystal River Unit 3 
  In December 2014, the FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida's decision to construct an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) for the retired Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear plant and approved Duke Energy Florida's request to defer amortization of the ISFSI pending resolution of litigation against the federal government as a result of the Department of Energy's breach of its obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel. The return rate is based on the currently approved AFUDC rate with a return on equity of   7.35 percent  , or 70 percent of the currently approved   10.5 percent  . The return rate is subject to change if the return on equity changes in the future. In September 2016, the FPSC approved an amendment to the 2013 Settlement authorizing recovery of the ISFSI through the Capacity Cost Recovery Clause. Through   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy Florida has deferred approximately   $113 million   for recovery associated with building the ISFSI. See Note   5   for additional information on spent nuclear fuel litigation.  
  The regulatory asset associated with the original Crystal River Unit 3 power uprate project will continue to be recovered through the NCRC over an estimated   seven  -year period that began in 2013 with a remaining uncollected balance of   $87 million   at   December 31, 2017  .

Crystal River Unit 3 Regulatory Asset 
  On September 15, 2015, the FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida's motion for approval of a settlement agreement with intervenors to reduce the value of the projected Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset to be recovered to   $1.283 billion   as of December 31, 2015. An impairment charge of   $15 million   was recognized in 2015 to adjust the regulatory asset balance. In November 2015, the FPSC issued a financing order approving Duke Energy Florida s request to issue nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance its unrecovered regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3 through a wholly owned special purpose entity. Nuclear asset-recovery bonds replace the base rate recovery methodology authorized by the 2013 Settlement and result in a lower rate impact to customers with a recovery period of approximately   20 years  . 
  Pursuant to provisions in Florida Statutes and the FPSC financing order, in 2016, Duke Energy Florida formed Duke Energy Florida Project Finance, LLC (DEFPF), a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary for the purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds. In June 2016, DEFPF issued   $1,294 million   aggregate principal amount of senior secured bonds (nuclear asset-recovery bonds) to finance the recovery of Duke Energy Florida's Crystal River 3 regulatory asset. 
  In connection with this financing, net proceeds to DEFPF of approximately   $1,287 million  , after underwriting costs, were used to acquire nuclear asset-recovery property from Duke Energy Florida and to pay transaction related expenses. The nuclear asset-recovery property includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge, to be collected on a per kilowatt-hour basis, from all Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid in full. Duke Energy Florida began collecting the nuclear asset-recovery charge on behalf of DEFPF in customer rates in July 2016. 
  See Note   17   for additional information.  
  Levy Nuclear Project 
  On July 28, 2008, Duke Energy Florida applied to the NRC for COLs for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at Levy (Levy Nuclear Project). In 2008, the FPSC granted Duke Energy Florida s petition for an affirmative Determination of Need and related orders requesting cost recovery under Florida s nuclear cost-recovery rule, together with the associated facilities, including transmission lines and substation facilities. In October 2016, the NRC issued COLs for the proposed Levy Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2. Duke Energy Florida is not required to build the nuclear reactors as a result of the COLs being issued. 
  On January 28, 2014, Duke Energy Florida terminated the Levy engineering, procurement and construction agreement (EPC). Duke Energy Florida may be required to pay for work performed under the EPC. Duke Energy Florida recorded an exit obligation in 2014 for the termination of the EPC. This liability was recorded within Other in Other Noncurrent Liabilities with an offset primarily to Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Florida is allowed to recover reasonable and prudent EPC cancellation costs from its retail customers. On May 1, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed a request with the FPSC to recover approximately   $82 million   of Levy Nuclear Project costs from retail customers in 2018. As part of the 2017 Settlement discussed above, Duke Energy Florida is no longer seeking recovery of costs related to the Levy Nuclear Project and the ongoing Westinghouse litigation discussed in Note   5  . All remaining Levy Nuclear Project issues have been resolved.  
  Crystal River 1 and 2 Coal Units 
  Duke Energy Florida has evaluated Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units for retirement in order to comply with certain environmental regulations. Based on this evaluation, those units are expected to be retired by the end of 2018. Once those units are retired Duke Energy Florida will continue recovery of existing annual depreciation expense through the end of 2020. Beginning in 2021, Duke Energy Florida will be allowed to recover any remaining net book value of the assets from retail customers through the Capacity Cost Recovery Clause.

On September 26, 2017, the PUCO staff filed a report recommending a revenue decrease between approximately   $18 million   and   $29 million   and a return on equity between   9.22 percent   and   10.24 percent  . On February 15, 2018, the procedural schedule was suspended to facilitate ongoing settlement discussions. Duke Energy Ohio expects rates will go into effect the second quarter of 2018. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  
  Natural Gas Pipeline Extension 
  Duke Energy Ohio is proposing to install a new natural gas pipeline in its Ohio service territory to increase system reliability and enable the retirement of older infrastructure. On January 20, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed an amended application with the Ohio Power Siting Board for approval of one of two proposed routes. A public hearing was held on June 15, 2017, and an adjudicatory hearing was scheduled to begin September 11, 2017. On August 24, 2017, an administrative law judge (ALJ) granted a request made by Duke Energy Ohio to delay the procedural schedule while it works through various issues related to the pipeline route. If approved, construction of the pipeline extension is expected to be completed before the 2020/2021 winter season. The proposed project involves the installation of a natural gas line and is estimated to cost approximately   $110 million  , excluding AFUDC.  
  Advanced Metering Infrastructure 
  On April 25, 2016, Duke Energy Kentucky filed with the KPSC an application for approval of a CPCN for the construction of advanced metering infrastructure. Duke Energy Kentucky estimates the   $49 million   project will take two years to complete. Duke Energy Kentucky also requested approval to establish a regulatory asset for the remaining book value of existing meter equipment and inventory to be replaced. Duke Energy Kentucky and the Kentucky attorney general entered into a stipulation to settle matters related to the application. On May 25, 2017, the KPSC issued an order to approve the stipulation with certain modifications. On June 1, 2017, Duke Energy Kentucky filed its acceptance of the modifications. The deployment of AMI meters began in third quarter 2017 and is expected to be completed in early 2019. Duke Energy Ohio has approximately   $6 million   included in Regulatory assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at   December 31, 2017  , for the book value of existing meter equipment.

Accelerated Natural Gas Service Line Replacement Rider 
  On January 20, 2015, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for approval of an accelerated natural gas service line replacement program (ASRP). Under the ASRP, Duke Energy Ohio proposed to replace certain natural gas service lines on an accelerated basis over a 10-year period. Duke Energy Ohio also proposed to complete preliminary survey and investigation work related to natural gas service lines that are customer owned and for which it does not have valid records and, further, to relocate interior natural gas meters to suitable exterior locations where such relocation can be accomplished. Duke Energy Ohio's projected total capital and operations and maintenance expenditures under the ASRP were approximately   $240 million  . The filing also sought approval of a rider mechanism (Rider ASRP) to recover related expenditures. Duke Energy Ohio proposed to update Rider ASRP on an annual basis. Intervenors opposed the ASRP, primarily because they believe the program is neither required nor necessary under federal pipeline regulation. On October 26, 2016, the PUCO issued an order denying the proposed ASRP. Duke Energy Ohio's application for rehearing of the PUCO decision was denied on May 17, 2017.  
  Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery 
  On March 28, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for recovery of program costs, lost distribution revenue and performance incentives related to its energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs. These programs are undertaken to comply with environmental mandates set forth in Ohio law. The PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohio s application but found that Duke Energy Ohio was not permitted to use banked energy savings from previous years in order to calculate the amount of allowed incentive. This conclusion represented a change to the cost recovery mechanism that had been agreed upon by intervenors and approved by the PUCO in previous cases. The PUCO granted the applications for rehearing filed by Duke Energy Ohio and an intervenor. On January 6, 2016, Duke Energy Ohio and the PUCO Staff entered into a stipulation, pending the PUCO's approval, to resolve issues related to performance incentives and the PUCO Staff audit of 2013 costs, among other issues. In December 2015, based upon the stipulation, Duke Energy Ohio re-established approximately   $20 million   of the revenues that had been previously reversed. On October 26, 2016, the PUCO issued an order approving the stipulation without modification. In December 2016, the PUCO granted the intervenors request for rehearing for the purpose of further review. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  
  On June 15, 2016, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for approval of a three-year energy efficiency and peak demand reduction portfolio of programs. A stipulation and modified stipulation were filed on December 22, 2016, and January 27, 2017, respectively. Under the terms of the stipulations, which included support for deferral authority of all costs and a cap on shared savings incentives, Duke Energy Ohio offered its energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs throughout 2017. On February 3, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed for deferral authority of its costs incurred in 2017 in respect of its proposed energy efficiency and peak demand reduction portfolio. On September 27, 2017, the PUCO issued an order approving a modified stipulation. The modifications impose an annual cap of approximately   $38 million   on program costs and shared savings incentives combined, but allowed for Duke Energy Ohio to file for a waiver of costs in excess of the cap in 2017. The PUCO approved the waiver request up to a total cost of   $56 million  . On November 21, 2017, the PUCO granted Duke Energy Ohio's and intervenor's applications for rehearing of the September 27, 2017, order. On January 10, 2018, the PUCO denied the Ohio Consumers' Counsel s application for rehearing of the PUCO order granting Duke Energy Ohio's waiver request. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  2014 Electric Security Plan 
  In April 2015, the PUCO modified and approved Duke Energy Ohio's proposed electric security plan (ESP), with a three-year term and an effective date of June 1, 2015. The PUCO approved a competitive procurement process for SSO load, a distribution capital investment rider and a tracking mechanism for incremental distribution expenses caused by major storms. The PUCO also approved a placeholder tariff for a price stabilization rider, but denied Duke Energy Ohio's specific request to include Duke Energy Ohio's entitlement to generation from OVEC in the rider at this time; however, the order allows Duke Energy Ohio to submit additional information to request recovery in the future. On May 4, 2015, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for rehearing requesting the PUCO to modify or amend certain aspects of the order. On May 28, 2015, the PUCO granted all applications for rehearing filed in the case for future consideration. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of the appeals in this matter. 
  2012 Natural Gas Rate Case/MGP Cost Recovery 
  On November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an order approving a settlement of Duke Energy Ohio s natural gas base rate case and authorizing the recovery of costs incurred between 2008 and 2012 for environmental investigation and remediation of two former MGP sites. The PUCO order also authorized Duke Energy Ohio to continue deferring MGP environmental investigation and remediation costs incurred subsequent to 2012 and to submit annual filings to adjust the MGP rider for future costs. Intervening parties appealed this decision to the Ohio Supreme Court and on June 29, 2017, the Ohio Supreme Court issued its decision affirming the PUCO order. Appellants filed a request for reconsideration, which was denied on September 27, 2017. This matter is now final. 
  The PUCO order also contained deadlines for completing the MGP environmental investigation and remediation costs at the MGP sites. For the property known as the East End site, the PUCO order established a deadline of December 31, 2016, which was subsequently extended to December 31, 2019. In January 2017, intervening parties filed for rehearing of the PUCO's decision. On February 8, 2017, the PUCO denied the rehearing request. As of   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy Ohio had approximately,   $35 million   included in Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for future remediation costs expected to be incurred at the East End site. 
  Regional Transmission Organization Realignment 
  Duke Energy Ohio, including Duke Energy Kentucky, transferred control of its transmission assets from MISO to PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM), effective December 31, 2011. The PUCO approved a settlement related to Duke Energy Ohio s recovery of certain costs of the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) realignment via a non-bypassable rider. Duke Energy Ohio is allowed to recover all MISO Transmission Expansion Planning (MTEP) costs, including but not limited to Multi Value Project (MVP) costs, directly or indirectly charged to Ohio customers. Duke Energy Ohio also agreed to vigorously defend against any charges for MVP projects from MISO. The KPSC also approved a request to effect the RTO realignment, subject to a commitment not to seek double recovery in a future rate case of the transmission expansion fees that may be charged by MISO and PJM in the same period or overlapping periods.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of Duke Energy Ohio s recorded liability for its exit obligation and share of MTEP costs, excluding MVP, recorded within Other in Current liabilities and Other in Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The retail portions of MTEP costs billed by MISO are recovered by Duke Energy Ohio through a non-bypassable rider. As of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  ,   $50 million   and   $71 million   are recorded in Regulatory assets on Duke Energy Ohio's Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.   

  MVP.   MISO approved   17   MVP proposals prior to Duke Energy Ohio s exit from MISO on December 31, 2011. Construction of these projects is expected to continue through 2020. Costs of these projects, including operating and maintenance costs, property and income taxes, depreciation and an allowed return, are allocated and billed to MISO transmission owners. 
  On December 29, 2011, MISO filed a tariff with the FERC providing for the allocation of MVP costs to a withdrawing owner based on monthly energy usage. The FERC set for hearing (i) whether MISO s proposed cost allocation methodology to transmission owners who withdrew from MISO prior to January 1, 2012, is consistent with the tariff at the time of their withdrawal from MISO and, (ii) if not, what the amount of and methodology for calculating any MVP cost responsibility should be. In 2012, MISO estimated Duke Energy Ohio s MVP obligation over the period from 2012 to 2071 at   $2.7 billion  , on an undiscounted basis. On July 16, 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued an initial decision. Under this initial decision, Duke Energy Ohio would be liable for MVP costs. Duke Energy Ohio filed exceptions to the initial decision, requesting FERC to overturn the ALJ s decision. 
  On October 29, 2015, the FERC issued an order reversing the ALJ's decision. The FERC ruled the cost allocation methodology is not consistent with the MISO tariff and that Duke Energy Ohio has no liability for MVP costs after its withdrawal from MISO. On May 19, 2016, the FERC denied the request for rehearing filed by MISO and the MISO Transmission Owners. On July 15, 2016, the MISO Transmission Owners filed a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On June 21, 2017, a three-judge panel affirmed FERC's 2015 decision holding that Duke Energy Ohio has no liability for the cost of the MVP projects constructed after Duke Energy Ohio's withdrawal from MISO. MISO did not file further petitions for review and this matter is now final.

     Coal Combustion Residual Plan 
  On March 17, 2016, Duke Energy Indiana filed with the IURC a request for approval of its first group of federally mandated CCR rule compliance projects (Phase I CCR Compliance Projects) to comply with the EPA's CCR rule. The projects in this Phase I filing are CCR compliance projects, including the conversion of Cayuga and Gibson stations to dry bottom ash handling and related water treatment. Duke Energy Indiana requested timely recovery of approximately   $380 million   in retail capital costs, including AFUDC, and recovery of incremental operating and maintenance costs under a federal mandate tracker that provides for timely recovery of   80 percent   of such costs and deferral with carrying costs of   20 percent   of such costs for recovery in a subsequent retail base rate case. On January 24, 2017, Duke Energy Indiana and various intervenors filed a settlement agreement with the IURC. Terms of the settlement include recovery of   60 percent   of the estimated CCR compliance construction project capital costs through existing rider mechanisms and deferral of   40 percent   of these costs until Duke Energy Indiana's next general retail rate case. The deferred costs will earn a return based on Duke Energy Indiana's long-term debt rate of   4.73 percent   until costs are included in retail rates, at which time the deferred costs will earn a full return. Costs are to be capped at   $365 million  , plus actual AFUDC. Costs above the cap would be considered for recovery in the next rate case. Terms of the settlement agreement also require Duke Energy Indiana to perform certain reporting and groundwater monitoring. On May 24, 2017, the IURC approved the settlement agreement.

Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Plant 
  Costs for the Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Plant are recovered from retail electric customers via a tracking mechanism (IGCC rider) with updates filed by Duke Energy Indiana. The IGCC Plant was placed into commercial operation in June 2013. 
  On August 24, 2016, the IURC approved a settlement (IGCC Settlement) among Duke Energy Indiana and several intervenors to resolve disputes related to five IGCC riders (the 11th through 15th) and a subdocket to Duke Energy Indiana's fuel adjustment clause. The IGCC settlement resulted in customers not being billed for previously incurred plant operating costs of   $87.5 million   and payments and commitments from Duke Energy Indiana of   $5.5 million   for attorneys  fees and consumer programs funding. Duke Energy Indiana recognized pretax impairment and related charges of   $93 million   in 2015. Additionally, under the IGCC settlement, the recovery of operating and maintenance expenses and ongoing maintenance capital at the plant were subject to certain caps during the years of 2016 and 2017. The IGCC settlement also included a commitment to either retire or stop burning coal by December 31, 2022, at the Gallagher Station. Pursuant to the IGCC settlement, the in-service date used for accounting and ratemaking will remain as June 2013. Remaining deferred costs will be recovered over   eight years   beginning in 2016 and not earn a carrying cost. As of   December 31, 2017  , deferred costs related to the project are approximately   $152 million   and are included in Regulatory assets in Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on Duke Energy Indiana's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the IGCC settlement, future IGCC riders will be filed annually with the next filing scheduled for first quarter 2018. 
  The ninth semi-annual IGCC rider order was appealed by various intervenors and the matter was remanded to the IURC for further proceedings and additional findings on a tax in-service issue. On February 2, 2017, the IURC issued an order upholding the original decision, finding that an estimate of impact on customer rates due to the federal income tax in-service determination was reasonable.  
  FERC Transmission Return on Equity Complaint 
  Customer groups have filed with the FERC complaints against MISO and its transmission-owning members, including Duke Energy Indiana, alleging, among other things, that the current base rate of return on equity earned by MISO transmission owners of   12.38 percent   is unjust and unreasonable. The complaints claim, among other things, that the current base rate of return on equity earned by MISO transmission owners should be reduced to   8.67 percent  . On January 5, 2015, the FERC issued an order accepting the MISO transmission owners' adder of   0.50 percent   to the base rate of return on equity based on participation in an RTO subject to it being applied to a return on equity that is shown to be just and reasonable in the pending return on equity complaints. On December 22, 2015, the presiding FERC ALJ in the first complaint issued an Initial Decision in which the base rate of return on equity was set at   10.32 percent  . On September 28, 2016, the Initial Decision in the first complaint was affirmed by FERC, but is subject to rehearing requests. On June 30, 2016, the presiding FERC ALJ in the second complaint issued an Initial Decision setting the base rate of return on equity at   9.70 percent  . The Initial Decision in the second complaint is pending FERC review. On April 14, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in   Emera Maine v. FERC  , reversed and remanded certain aspects of the methodology employed by FERC to establish rates of return on equity. This decision may affect the outcome of the complaints against Duke Energy Indiana. Duke Energy Indiana currently believes these matters will not have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  
  Grid Infrastructure Improvement Plan 
  On December 7, 2015, Duke Energy Indiana filed a grid infrastructure improvement plan with an estimated cost of   $1.8 billion   in response to guidance from IURC orders and the Indiana Court of Appeals decisions related to a new statute. The plan uses a combination of advanced technology and infrastructure upgrades to improve service to customers and provide them with better information about their energy use. It also provides for cost recovery through a transmission and distribution rider (T D Rider). In March 2016, Duke Energy Indiana entered into a settlement with all parties to the proceeding except the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc. The settlement agreement decreased the capital expenditures eligible for timely recovery of costs in the seven-year plan to approximately   $1.4 billion  , including the removal of an AMI project. Under the settlement, the return on equity to be used in the T D Rider is   10 percent  . The IURC approved the settlement and issued a final order on June 29, 2016. The order was not appealed and the proceeding is concluded. 
  The settlement agreement provided for deferral accounting for depreciation and post-in-service carrying costs for AMI projects outside the plan. Duke Energy Indiana withdrew its request for a regulatory asset for current meters and will retain any savings associated with future AMI installation until the next retail base rate case, which is required to be filed prior to the end of the plan. During the third quarter of 2016, Duke Energy Indiana decided to implement the AMI project. This decision resulted in a pretax impairment charge related to existing or non-AMI meters of approximately   $8 million   in 2016, based in part on the requirement to file a base rate case in 2022 under the approved plan. Duke Energy Indiana evaluates the need for rate cases as part of its business planning, based on the outlook of emerging costs, ongoing investment and impact related to the Tax Act enacted in late 2017 and expects to file a rate case prior to the 2022 requirement. As a result, in 2017, Duke Energy Indiana recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately   $22 million  . As of December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Indiana's remaining net book value of non-AMI meters is approximately   $21 million   and will be depreciated through July 2020.

Benton County Wind Farm Dispute 
  On December 16, 2013, Benton County Wind Farm LLC (BCWF) filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Indiana seeking damages for past generation losses alleging Duke Energy Indiana violated its obligations under a 2006 PPA by refusing to offer electricity to the market at negative prices. Damage claims continue to increase during times that BCWF is not dispatched. Under 2013 revised MISO market rules, Duke Energy Indiana is required to make a price offer to MISO for the power it proposes to sell into MISO markets and MISO determines whether BCWF is dispatched. Because market prices would have been negative due to increased market participation, Duke Energy Indiana determined it would not bid at negative prices in order to balance customer needs against BCWF's need to run. BCWF contends Duke Energy Indiana must bid at the lowest negative price to ensure dispatch, while Duke Energy Indiana contends it is not obligated to bid at any particular price, that it cannot ensure dispatch with any bid and that it has reasonably balanced the parties' interests. On July 6, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered judgment against BCWF on all claims. BCWF appealed the decision and on December 9, 2016, the appeals court ruled in favor of BCWF. Duke Energy Indiana recorded an obligation and a regulatory asset related to the settlement amount in fourth quarter 2016. On June 30, 2017, the parties finalized a settlement agreement. Terms of the settlement included Duke Energy Indiana paying   $29 million   for back damages. Additionally, the parties agreed on the method by which the contract will be bid into the market in the future. The settlement amount was paid in June 2017. The IURC issued an order on September 27, 2017, approving recovery of the settlement amount through Duke Energy Indiana's fuel clause. The IURC order has been appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

North Carolina Integrity Management Rider Filings 
  In October 2017, Piedmont filed a petition with the NCUC under the Integrity Management Rider (IMR) mechanism to collect an additional   $8.9 million   in annual revenues, effective December 2017, based on the eligible capital investments closed to integrity and safety projects over the six-month period ending September 30, 2017. On November 28, 2017, the NCUC approved the requested rate adjustment. 
  In May 2017, Piedmont filed, and the NCUC approved, a petition under the IMR mechanism to collect an additional   $11.6 million   in annual revenues, effective June 2017, based on the eligible capital investments closed to integrity and safety projects over the six-month period ending March 31, 2017.  
  Tennessee Integrity Management Rider Filing 
  In November 2017, Piedmont filed a petition with the TPUC under the IMR mechanism to collect an additional   $3.3 million   in annual revenues, effective January 2018, based on the eligible capital investments closed to integrity and safety projects over the 12-month period ending October 31, 2017. In January 2018, Piedmont filed an amended computation under the IMR mechanism, revising the proposed increase in annual revenues to approximately   $0.4 million   based on the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate effective January 1, 2018. A hearing on this matter is scheduled for March 2018. 
  OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS 
  Atlantic Coast Pipeline 
  On September 2, 2014, Duke Energy, Dominion Resources (Dominion), Piedmont and Southern Company Gas announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC (ACP) to build and own the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP pipeline), an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia to North Carolina. The ACP pipeline is designed to meet, in part, the needs identified by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont. Dominion will build and operate the ACP pipeline and holds a leading ownership percentage in ACP of   48 percent  . Duke Energy owns a   47 percent   interest through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. Southern Company Gas maintains a   5 percent   interest. See Notes   12   and   17   for additional information related to Duke Energy's ownership interest. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont, among others, will be customers of the pipeline. Purchases will be made under several   20  -year supply contracts, subject to state regulatory approval. On September 18, 2015, ACP filed an application with the FERC requesting a CPCN authorizing ACP to construct the pipeline. ACP executed a construction agreement in September 2016. ACP also requested approval of an open access tariff and the precedent agreements it entered into with future pipeline customers. In December 2016, FERC issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) indicating that the proposed pipeline would not cause significant harm to the environment or protected populations. The FERC issued the final EIS in July 2017. On October 13, 2017, FERC issued an order approving the CPCN, subject to conditions. On October 16, 2017, ACP accepted the FERC order subject to reserving its right to file a request for rehearing or clarification on a timely basis. On November 9, 2017, ACP filed a request for rehearing on several limited issues. On December 12, 2017, ACP filed an answer to intervenors  request for rehearing of the certificate order and for stay of the certificate order.  
  In December 2017, West Virginia issued a waiver of the state water quality permit in reliance on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers national water quality permit and Virginia issued a conditional water quality permit subject to completion of additional studies and stormwater plans. In early 2018, the FERC issued a series of Partial Notices to Proceed which authorized the project to begin limited construction-related activities along the pipeline route. North Carolina issued the state water quality permit in January 2018. The project remains subject to other pending federal and state approvals, which will allow full construction activities to begin. The ACP pipeline project has a targeted in-service date of late 2019.  
  Due to delays in obtaining the required permits to commence construction and the conditions imposed upon the project by the permits, ACP's project manager estimates the project's pipeline development costs have increased from a range of   $5.0 billion   to   $5.5 billion   to a range of   $6.0 billion   and   $6.5 billion  , excluding financing costs. Project construction activities, schedule and final costs are still subject to uncertainty due to potential additional permitting delays, construction productivity and other conditions and risks which could result in potential higher project costs and a potential delay in the targeted in-service date. 
  Sabal Trail Transmission Pipeline 
  On May 4, 2015, Duke Energy acquired a   7.5 percent   ownership interest in Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail) from Spectra Energy Partners, LP, a master limited partnership, formed by Enbridge Inc. (formerly Spectra Energy Corp.). Spectra Energy Partners, LP holds a   50 percent   ownership interest in Sabal Trail and NextEra Energy has a   42.5 percent   ownership interest. Sabal Trail is a joint venture to construct a 515-mile natural gas pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to transport natural gas to Florida. Total estimated project costs are approximately   $3.2 billion  . The Sabal Trail pipeline traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The primary customers of the Sabal Trail pipeline, Duke Energy Florida and Florida Power   Light Company (FP L), have each contracted to buy pipeline capacity for   25  -year initial terms. See Notes   12   and   17   for additional information. 
  On February 3, 2016, the FERC issued an order granting the request for a CPCN to construct and operate the pipeline. The Sabal Trail pipeline received other required regulatory approvals and the phase one mainline was placed in service in July 2017. On October 12, 2017, Sabal Trail filed a request with FERC to place in-service a lateral line to Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County Combined Cycle facility, which remains pending. This request is required to support commissioning and testing activities at the facility.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

On September 21, 2016, intervenors filed an appeal of FERC's CPCN orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals). On August 22, 2017, the appeals court ruled against FERC in the case for failing to include enough information on the impact of greenhouse-gas emissions carried by the pipeline, vacated the CPCN order and remanded the case to FERC. In response to the August 2017 court decision, the FERC issued a draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) on September 27, 2017. On October 6, 2017, FERC and a group of industry intervenors, including Sabal Trail and Duke Energy Florida, filed separate petitions with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting rehearing regarding the court's decision to vacate the CPCN order. On January 31, 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the requests for rehearing. On February 2, 2018, Sabal Trail filed a request with FERC for expedited issuance of its order on remand and reissuance of the CPCN. In the alternative, the pipeline requested that FERC issue a temporary emergency CPCN to allow for continued operations. On February 5, 2018, FERC issued the final SEIS but did not issue the order on remand. On February 6, 2018, FERC and the intervenors in this case each filed motions for stay with the D.C. Circuit Court to stay the court's mandate. The February 6, 2018 motions automatically stay the issuance of the court s mandate until the later of seven days after the court denies the motions or the expiration of any stay granted by the court. Both motions are pending. Sabal Trail will continue to monitor the progress and the impact to the project going forward.  
  Constitution Pipeline 
  Duke Energy owns a   24 percent   ownership interest in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution). Constitution is a natural gas pipeline project slated to transport natural gas supplies from the Marcellus supply region in northern Pennsylvania to major northeastern markets. The pipeline will be constructed and operated by Williams Partners L.P., which has a   41 percent   ownership share. The remaining interest is held by Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation and WGL Holdings, Inc. Before the permitting delays discussed below, Duke Energy's total anticipated contributions were approximately   $229 million  . As a result of the permitting delays and project uncertainty, total anticipated contributions by Duke Energy can no longer be reasonably estimated  . 
  In December 2014, Constitution received approval from the FERC to construct and operate the proposed pipeline. However, on April 22, 2016, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) denied Constitution s application for a necessary water quality certification for the New York portion of the Constitution pipeline. Constitution filed legal actions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (U.S. Court of Appeals) challenging the legality and appropriateness of the NYSDEC s decision and on August 18, 2017, the petition was denied in part and dismissed in part. In September 2017, Constitution filed a petition for a rehearing of portions of the decision unrelated to the water quality certification, which was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals. In January 2018, Constitution petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to review the U.S. Court of Appeals decision. In October 2017, Constitution filed a petition for declaratory order requesting FERC to find that the NYSDEC waived its rights to issue a Section 401 water quality certification by not acting on Constitution's application within a reasonable period of time as required by statute. This petition was based on precedent established by another pipeline s successful petition with FERC following a District of Columbia Circuit Court ruling. On January 11, 2018, FERC denied Constitution's petition. In February 2018, Constitution filed a rehearing request with FERC of its finding that the NYSDEC did not waive the Section 401 certification requirement. Constitution is currently unable to approximate an in-service date for the project due to the NYDSEC's denial of the water quality certification. The Constitution partners remain committed to the project and are evaluating next steps to move the project forward. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  Since April 2016, with the actions of the NYSDEC, Constitution stopped construction and discontinued capitalization of future development costs until the project's uncertainty is resolved.  
  See Notes   12   and   17   for additional information related to ownership interest and carrying value of the investment. 
  Progress Energy Merger FERC Mitigation 
  Following the closing of the Progress Energy merger, outside counsel reviewed Duke Energy s long-term FERC mitigation plan and discovered a technical error in the calculations. On December 6, 2013, Duke Energy submitted a filing to the FERC disclosing the error and arguing that no additional mitigation is necessary. The city of New Bern filed a protest and requested that FERC order additional mitigation. On October 29, 2014, the FERC ordered that the amount of the stub mitigation be increased from 25 MW to 129 MW. The stub mitigation is Duke Energy s commitment to set aside for third parties a certain quantity of firm transmission capacity from Duke Energy Carolinas to Duke Energy Progress during summer off-peak hours. The FERC also ordered that Duke Energy operate certain phase shifters to create additional import capability and that such operation be monitored by an independent monitor. The costs to comply with this order are not material. The FERC also referred Duke Energy s failure to expressly designate the phase shifter reactivation as a mitigation project in the original mitigation plan filing in March 2012 to the FERC Office of Enforcement for further inquiry. In response, and since December 2014, the FERC Office of Enforcement has been conducting a nonpublic investigation of Duke Energy's market power analyses included in the Progress merger filings submitted to FERC. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this investigation. 
  Potential Coal Plant Retirements 
  The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with their state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. Recent IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities in Florida and Indiana earlier than their current estimated useful lives primarily because facilities do not have the requisite emission control equipment to meet EPA regulations recently approved or proposed.

  5  . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  INSURANCE 
  General Insurance 
  The Duke Energy Registrants have insurance and reinsurance coverage either directly or through indemnification from Duke Energy s captive insurance company, Bison, and its affiliates, consistent with companies engaged in similar commercial operations with similar type properties. The Duke Energy Registrants  coverage includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for liabilities arising to third parties for bodily injury and property damage; (ii) workers  compensation; (iii) automobile liability coverage; and (iv) property coverage for all real and personal property damage. Real and personal property damage coverage excludes electric transmission and distribution lines, but includes damages arising from boiler and machinery breakdowns, earthquakes, flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or replacement power coverage. All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or retentions, sublimits, exclusions, terms and conditions common for companies with similar types of operations. The Duke Energy Registrants self-insure their electric transmission and distribution lines against loss due to storm damage and other natural disasters. As discussed further in Note   4  , Duke Energy Florida maintains a storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of named storms on an expedited basis. 
  The cost of the Duke Energy Registrants  coverage can fluctuate from year to year reflecting claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance markets. 
  In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance and reinsurance available might not be adequate to cover claims and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available. 
  Nuclear Insurance 
  Duke Energy Carolinas owns and operates the McGuire Nuclear Station (McGuire) and the Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee) and operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station (Catawba). McGuire and Catawba each have two reactors. Oconee has three reactors. The other joint owners of Catawba reimburse Duke Energy Carolinas for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Catawba joint owner agreements. 
  Duke Energy Progress owns and operates the Robinson Nuclear Plant (Robinson), Brunswick and Harris. Robinson and Harris each have one reactor. Brunswick has two reactors. 
  Duke Energy Florida owns Crystal River Unit 3, which permanently ceased operation in 2013 and reached a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018 after the successful transfer of all used nuclear fuel assemblies to an onsite dry cask storage facility. 
  In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on Duke Energy Carolinas , Duke Energy Progress  and Duke Energy Florida s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Nuclear Liability Coverage 
  The Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for public nuclear liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total financial protection liability. The maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately   $13.4 billion  , is subject to change every five years for inflation and for the number of licensed reactors. Total nuclear liability coverage consists of a combination of private primary nuclear liability insurance coverage and a mandatory industry risk-sharing program to provide for excess nuclear liability coverage above the maximum reasonably available private primary coverage. The U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims. 
  Primary Liability Insurance 
  Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have purchased the maximum reasonably available private primary nuclear liability insurance as required by law, which is   $450 million   per station.  
  Excess Liability Program 
  This program provides   $13 billion   of coverage per incident through the Price-Anderson Act s mandatory industrywide excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling. This amount is the product of potential cumulative retrospective premium assessments of   $127 million   times the current   102   licensed commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. Under this program, licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to compensate for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed facility in the U.S. Retrospective premiums may be assessed at a rate not to exceed   $19 million   per year per licensed reactor for each incident. The assessment may be subject to state premium taxes. 
  Nuclear Property and Accidental Outage Coverage 
  Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), an industry mutual insurance company, which provides property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. Additionally, NEIL provides accidental outage coverage for each station for losses in the event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear station. 
  Pursuant to regulations of the NRC, each company s property damage insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied, first, to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning, plant repair or restoration. 
  Losses resulting from acts of terrorism are covered as common occurrences, such that if terrorist acts occur against one or more commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL within a 12-month period, they would be treated as one event and the owners of the plants where the act occurred would share one full limit of liability. The full limit of liability is currently   $3.2 billion  . NEIL sublimits the total aggregate for all of their policies for non-nuclear terrorist events to approximately   $1.83 billion  . 
  Each nuclear facility has accident property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits of   $1.5 billion  , except for Crystal River Unit 3. Crystal River Unit 3 s limit is   $50 million   and is on an actual cash value basis. All nuclear facilities except for Catawba and Crystal River Unit 3 also share an additional   $1.25 billion   nuclear accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. Catawba has a dedicated   $1.25 billion   of additional nuclear accident insurance limit above its dedicated underlying limit. Catawba and Oconee also have an additional   $750 million   of non-nuclear accident property damage limit. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles. 
  NEIL s Accidental Outage policy provides some coverage, such as business interruption, for losses in the event of a major accident property damage outage of a nuclear unit. Coverage is provided on a weekly limit basis after a significant waiting period deductible and at   100 percent   of the available weekly limits for 52 weeks and   80 percent   of the available weekly limits for the next 110 weeks. Coverage is provided until these available weekly periods are met where the accidental outage policy limit will not exceed   $490 million   for McGuire and Catawba,   $462 million   for Brunswick,   $448 million   for Harris,   $434 million   for Oconee and   $378 million   for Robinson. NEIL sublimits the accidental outage recovery to the first 104 weeks of coverage not to exceed   $328 million   from non-nuclear accidental property damage. Coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles. 
  Potential Retroactive Premium Assessments 
  In the event of NEIL losses, NEIL s board of directors may assess member companies' retroactive premiums of amounts up to   10   times their annual premiums for up to   six years   after a loss. NEIL has never exercised this assessment. The maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligations for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are   $146 million  ,   $96 million   and   $1 million  , respectively. Duke Energy Carolinas' maximum assessment amount includes   100 percent   of potential obligations to NEIL for jointly owned reactors. Duke Energy Carolinas would seek reimbursement from the joint owners for their portion of these assessment amounts. 
  ENVIRONMENTAL 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time, imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy Registrants. The following environmental matters impact all of the Duke Energy Registrants.

Remediation Activities 
  In addition to the ARO recorded as a result of various environmental regulations, discussed in Note   9  , the Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites. These include certain properties that are part of ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state and local agencies, remediation activities vary based upon site conditions and location, remediation requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held responsible for environmental impacts caused by other potentially responsible parties and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be estimated because the extent of environmental impact, allocation among potentially responsible parties, remediation alternatives and/or regulatory decisions have not yet been determined at all sites. Additional costs associated with remediation activities are likely to be incurred in the future and could be significant. Costs are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable. 
  The following tables contain information regarding reserves for probable and estimable costs related to the various environmental sites. These reserves are recorded in Accounts payable within Current Liabilities and Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.    

  As of December 31, 2016, October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Piedmont's environmental reserve was   $1 million  . In 2017, a   $1 million   provision was recorded, resulting in a reserve balance of   $2 million   at December 31, 2017. 
  Additional losses in excess of recorded reserves that could be incurred for the stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring for environmental sites that have been evaluated at this time are not material except as presented in the table below.   

  North Carolina and South Carolina Ash Basins 
  In February 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas  retired Dan River Steam Station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates   30,000   to   39,000   tons of ash and   24 million   to   27 million   gallons of basin water were released into the river. In July 2014, Duke Energy completed remediation work identified by the EPA and continues to cooperate with the EPA's civil enforcement process. Future costs related to the Dan River release, including future state or federal civil enforcement proceedings, future regulatory directives, natural resources damages, future claims or litigation and long-term environmental impact costs, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
  The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) has historically assessed Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with Notice of Violations (NOV) for violations that were most often resolved through satisfactory corrective actions and minor, if any, fines or penalties. Subsequent to the Dan River ash release, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have been served with a higher level of NOVs, including assessed penalties for violations at L.V. Sutton Combined Cycle Plant (Sutton) and Dan River Steam Station. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict whether the NCDEQ will assess future penalties related to existing unresolved NOVs and if such penalties would be material. See "NCDEQ Notices of Violation" section below for additional discussion.

LITIGATION 
  Duke Energy 
  Duke Energy no longer has exposure to litigation matters related to the International Disposal Group as a result of the divestiture of the business in December 2016. See Note 2 for additional information related to the sale of International Energy. 
  Ash Basin Shareholder Derivative Litigation 
  Five shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Delaware Chancery Court relating to the release at Dan River and to the management of Duke Energy s ash basins. On October 31, 2014, the five lawsuits were consolidated in a single proceeding titled   In Re Duke Energy Corporation Coal Ash Derivative Litigation  . On December 2, 2014, plaintiffs filed a Corrected Verified Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (Consolidated Complaint). The Consolidated Complaint names as defendants several current and former Duke Energy officers and directors (collectively, the  Duke Energy Defendants ). Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. 
  The Consolidated Complaint alleges the Duke Energy Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately oversee Duke Energy s ash basins and that these breaches of fiduciary duty may have contributed to the incident at Dan River and continued thereafter. The lawsuit also asserts claims against the Duke Energy Defendants for corporate waste (relating to the money Duke Energy has spent and will spend as a result of the fines, penalties and coal ash removal) and unjust enrichment (relating to the compensation and director remuneration that was received despite these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty). The lawsuit seeks both injunctive relief against Duke Energy and restitution from the Duke Energy Defendants. On January 21, 2015, the Duke Energy Defendants filed a Motion to Stay, which the court granted. The stay was lifted on March 24, 2016, after which plaintiffs filed an Amended Verified Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (Amended Complaint) making the same allegations as in the Consolidated Complaint. The Duke Energy Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on June 21, 2016, which was granted by the Court on December 14, 2016. Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court on January 9, 2017. Oral argument was held on September 27, 2017. On December 15, 2017, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Chancery Court's order of dismissal. 
  In addition to the above derivative complaints, in 2014, Duke Energy received two shareholder litigation demand letters. The letters alleged that the members of the Board of Directors and certain officers breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the company to illegally dispose of and store coal ash pollutants. One of the letters also alleged a breach of fiduciary duty in the decision-making relating to the leadership changes following the close of the Progress Energy merger in July 2012. By letter dated September 4, 2015, attorneys for the shareholders were informed that, on the recommendation of the Demand Review Committee formed to consider such matters, the Board of Directors concluded not to pursue potential claims against individuals. One of the shareholders, Mitchell Pinsly, sent a formal demand for records and Duke Energy has responded to this request. There was no follow-up after the records were provided; therefore, this matter has been resolved. 
  On October 30, 2015, shareholder Saul Bresalier filed a shareholder derivative complaint (Bresalier Complaint) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges that several current and former Duke Energy officers and directors (Bresalier Defendants) breached their fiduciary duties in connection with coal ash environmental issues, the post-merger change in Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and oversight of political contributions. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. The Bresalier Complaint contends that the Demand Review Committee failed to appropriately consider the shareholder s earlier demand for litigation and improperly decided not to pursue claims against the Bresalier Defendants. On March 30, 2017, the court granted Defendants  Motion to Dismiss on the claims relating to coal ash environmental issues and political contributions. As discussed below, a settlement agreement was approved for the merger-related claims in the Bresalier Complaint, and those claims were dismissed. On September 8, 2017, Bresalier filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Third Circuit Court) challenging the dismissal of his coal ash and political contribution claims. On January 19 2018, Bresalier filed a stipulation of dismissal, closing this case. 
  Progress Energy Merger Shareholder Litigation 
  Duke Energy, the 11 members of the Board of Directors who were also members of the pre-merger Board of Directors (Legacy Duke Energy Directors) and certain Duke Energy officers were defendants in a purported securities class-action lawsuit   (Nieman v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al)  . This lawsuit consolidated three lawsuits originally filed in July 2012. The plaintiffs alleged federal Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) claims based on allegations of materially false and misleading representations and omissions in the Registration Statement filed on July 7, 2011, and purportedly incorporated into other documents, all in connection with the post-merger change in CEO. On August 15, 2014, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation. On March 10, 2015, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement and a Motion for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement. Under the terms of the agreement, Duke Energy agreed to pay   $146 million   to settle the claim. On April 22, 2015, Duke Energy made a payment of   $25 million   into the settlement escrow account. The remainder of   $121 million   was paid by insurers into the settlement escrow account. The final order approving the settlement was issued on November 2, 2015, thus closing the matter. 
  On May 31, 2013, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated four shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in 2012. The Court also appointed a lead plaintiff and counsel for plaintiffs and designated the case as   In Re Duke Energy Corporation Derivative Litigation   (Merger Chancery Litigation). The lawsuit names as defendants the Legacy Duke Energy Directors. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. The case alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties of loyalty and care in connection with the post-merger change in CEO. 
  Two shareholder Derivative Complaints, filed in 2012 in federal district court in Delaware, were consolidated as   Tansey v. Rogers, et al.   The case alleges claims against the Legacy Duke Energy Directors for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets, as well as claims under Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. On December 21, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint asserting the same claims contained in the original complaints.

The entire settlement amount was funded by insurance. The settlement amount, less court-approved attorney fees, totaled   $20 million   and was paid to Duke Energy in 2017. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
  Coal Ash Insurance Coverage Litigation 
  In March 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a civil action in North Carolina Superior Court against various insurance providers. The lawsuit seeks payment for coal ash-related liabilities covered by third-party liability insurance policies. The insurance policies were issued between 1971 and 1986 and provide third-party liability insurance for property damage. The civil action seeks damages for breach of contract and indemnification for costs arising from the Coal Ash Act and the EPA CCR rule at   15   coal-fired plants in North Carolina and South Carolina. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  NCDEQ Notice of Violation 
  On February 8, 2016, the NCDEQ assessed a penalty of approximately   $6.8 million  , including enforcement costs, against Duke Energy Carolinas related to stormwater pipes and associated discharges at the Dan River Steam Station. Duke Energy Carolinas recorded a charge in December 2015 for this penalty. In March 2016, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an appeal of this penalty. On September 23, 2016, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into a settlement agreement with the NCDEQ, without admission of liability, under which Duke Energy Carolinas agreed to a payment of   $6 million   to resolve allegations underlying the asserted civil penalty related to the Dan River coal ash release and a March 4, 2016, NOV alleging unpermitted discharges at the facility. 
  NCDEQ State Enforcement Actions 
  In the first quarter of 2013, Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) sent notices of intent to sue Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress related to alleged Clean Water Act (CWA) violations from coal ash basins at two of their coal-fired power plants in North Carolina. The NCDEQ filed enforcement actions against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress alleging violations of water discharge permits and North Carolina groundwater standards. The cases have been consolidated and are being heard before a single judge in the North Carolina Superior Court. 
  On August 16, 2013, the NCDEQ filed an enforcement action against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress related to their remaining plants in North Carolina alleging violations of the CWA and violations of the North Carolina groundwater standards. Both of these cases have been assigned to the judge handling the enforcement actions discussed above. SELC is representing several environmental groups who have been permitted to intervene in these cases. 
  The court issued orders in 2016 granting Motions for Partial Summary Judgment for   seven   of the   14   North Carolina plants with coal ash basins named in the enforcement actions. On February 13, 2017, the court issued an order denying motions for partial summary judgment brought by both the environmental groups and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress for the remaining   seven   plants. On March 15, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a Notice of Appeal to challenge the trial court s order. The parties were unable to reach an agreement at mediation in April 2017. The parties submitted briefs to the court on remaining issues to be tried and a ruling is pending.

It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, they might incur in connection with these matters. 
  Five previously filed cases involving the Riverbend, Cape Fear, H.F. Lee, Sutton and Buck plants have been dismissed or settled during 2016. 
  Groundwater Contamination Claims 
  Beginning in May 2015, a number of residents living in the vicinity of the North Carolina facilities with ash basins received letters from the NCDEQ advising them not to drink water from the private wells on their land tested by the NCDEQ as the samples were found to have certain substances at levels higher than the criteria set by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Results of Comprehensive Site Assessments (CSAs) testing performed by Duke Energy under the Coal Ash Act have been consistent with historical data provided to state regulators over many years. The DHHS and NCDEQ sent follow-up letters on October 15, 2015, to residents near coal ash basins who have had their wells tested, stating that private well samplings at a considerable distance from coal ash basins, as well as some municipal water supplies, contain similar levels of vanadium and hexavalent chromium, which led investigators to believe these constituents are naturally occurring. In March 2016, DHHS rescinded the advisories. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have received formal demand letters from residents near Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' coal ash basins. The residents claim damages for nuisance and diminution in property value, among other things. The parties held three days of mediation discussions which ended at impasse. On January 6, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress received the plaintiffs' notice of their intent to file suits should the matter not settle. The NCDEQ preliminarily approved Duke Energy s permanent water solution plans on January 13, 2017, and as a result shortly thereafter, Duke Energy issued a press release, providing additional details regarding the homeowner compensation package. This package consists of three components: (i) a   $5,000   goodwill payment to each eligible well owner to support the transition to a new water supply, (ii) where a public water supply is available and selected by the eligible well owner, a stipend to cover   25   years of water bills and (iii) the Property Value Protection Plan. The Property Value Protection Plan is a program offered by Duke Energy designed to guarantee eligible plant neighbors the fair market value of their residential property should they decide to sell their property during the time that the plan is offered. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recognized reserves of   $19 million   and   $4 million  , respectively. 
  On August 23, 2017, a class-action suit was filed in Wake County Superior Court, North Carolina, against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress on behalf of certain property owners living near coal ash impoundments at Allen, Asheville, Belews Creek, Buck, Cliffside, Lee, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro. The class is defined as those who are well-eligible under the Coal Ash Act or those to whom Duke Energy has promised a permanent replacement water supply and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, along with compensatory damages. Plaintiffs allege that Duke Energy s improper maintenance of coal ash impoundments caused harm, particularly through groundwater contamination. Despite NCDEQ s preliminary approval, Plaintiffs contend that Duke Energy s proposed permanent water solutions plan fails to comply with the Coal Ash Act. On September 28, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike the class designation. The parties entered into a Settlement Agreement on January 24, 2018, which resulted in the dismissal of the underlying class action on January 25, 2018.  
  On September 14, 2017, a complaint was filed against Duke Energy Progress in New Hanover County Superior Court by a group of homeowners residing approximately 1 mile from Duke Energy Progress' Sutton Steam Plant. The homeowners allege that coal ash constituents have been migrating from ash impoundments at Sutton into their groundwater for decades and that in 2015, Duke Energy Progress discovered these releases of coal ash, but failed to notify any officials or neighbors and failed to take remedial action. The homeowners claim unspecified physical and mental injuries as a result of consuming their well water and seek actual damages for personal injury, medical monitoring and punitive damages. Duke Energy filed its Motion to Dismiss on October 27, 2017, and the hearing is scheduled for March 7, 2018. 
  It is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure of loss, if any, that may occur in connection with claims which might be made by these residents. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas 
  Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims 
  Duke Energy Carolinas has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement related to asbestos exposure. These claims relate to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted on its electric generation plants prior to 1985. As of   December 31, 2017  , there were   161   asserted claims for non-malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to   $42 million   and   54   asserted claims for malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to   $16 million  . Based on Duke Energy Carolinas  experience, it is expected that the ultimate resolution of most of these claims likely will be less than the amount claimed. 
  Duke Energy Carolinas has recognized asbestos-related reserves of   $489 million   and   $512 million   at   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , respectively. These reserves are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These reserves are based upon the minimum amount of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through 2037, are recorded on an undiscounted basis and incorporate anticipated inflation. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2037 related to such potential claims. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves.

Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. Duke Energy Carolinas  cumulative payments began to exceed the self-insurance retention in 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries indemnification and medical cost claim payments is   $797 million   in excess of the self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were   $585 million   and   $587 million   at   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , respectively. These amounts are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets and Receivables within Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating. 
  Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida 
  Spent Nuclear Fuel Matters 
  On October 16, 2014, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida sued the U.S. in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit claimed the Department of Energy breached a contract in failing to accept spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and asserted damages for the cost of on-site storage. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida asserted damages for the period January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2013, of   $48 million   and   $25 million  , respectively. On November 17, 2017, the Court awarded Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida   $48 million   and   $21 million  , respectively, subject to appeal. No appeals were filed and Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will recognize the recoveries in the first quarter of 2018. Claims for all periods through 2013 have been resolved. Additional claims will be filed in 2018. 
  Duke Energy Progress 
  Gypsum Supply Agreements Matter 
  On June 30, 2017, CertainTeed Gypsum NC, Inc. (CertainTeed) filed a declaratory judgment action against Duke Energy Progress in the North Carolina Business Court relating to a gypsum supply agreement. In its complaint, CertainTeed seeks an order from the court declaring that the minimum amount of gypsum Duke Energy Progress must provide to CertainTeed under the supply agreement is   50,000   tons per month through 2029. On September 28, 2017, the Court denied CertainTeed's motion for summary judgment. Discovery in the case is underway and a trial date has not been set. In light of the volatility in future production of gypsum, Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  
  Duke Energy Florida 
  Class-Action Lawsuit 
  On February 22, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on behalf of a putative class of Duke Energy Florida and FP L s customers in Florida. The suit alleges the State of Florida s nuclear power plant cost recovery statutes (NCRS) are unconstitutional and pre-empted by federal law. Plaintiffs claim they are entitled to repayment of all money paid by customers of Duke Energy Florida and FP L as a result of the NCRS, as well as an injunction against any future charges under those statutes. The constitutionality of the NCRS has been challenged unsuccessfully in a number of prior cases on alternative grounds. Duke Energy Florida and FP L filed motions to dismiss the complaint on May 5, 2016. On September 21, 2016, the Court granted the motions to dismiss with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. On January 4, 2017, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The appeal, which has been fully briefed, was heard on August 22, 2017, and a decision is pending. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this appeal. 
  Westinghouse Contract Litigation 
  On March 28, 2014, Duke Energy Florida filed a lawsuit against Westinghouse in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The lawsuit seeks recovery of   $54 million   in milestone payments in excess of work performed under the terminated EPC for Levy as well as a determination by the court of the amounts due to Westinghouse as a result of the termination of the EPC. Duke Energy Florida recognized an exit obligation as a result of the termination of the EPC contract. 
  On March 31, 2014, Westinghouse filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Florida in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania lawsuit alleged damages under the EPC in excess of   $510 million   for engineering and design work, costs to end supplier contracts and an alleged termination fee. 
  On June 9, 2014, the judge in the North Carolina case ruled that the litigation will proceed in the Western District of North Carolina. On July 11, 2016, Duke Energy Florida and Westinghouse filed separate Motions for Summary Judgment. On September 29, 2016, the court issued its ruling on the parties' respective Motions for Summary Judgment, ruling in favor of Westinghouse on a   $30 million   termination fee claim and dismissing Duke Energy Florida's   $54 million   refund claim, but stating that Duke Energy Florida could use the refund claim to offset any damages for termination costs. Westinghouse's claim for termination costs was unaffected by this ruling and continued to trial. At trial, Westinghouse reduced its claim for termination costs from   $482 million   to   $424 million  . Following a trial on the matter, the court issued its final order in December 2016 denying Westinghouse s claim for termination costs and re-affirming its earlier ruling in favor of Westinghouse on the   $30 million   termination fee and Duke Energy Florida s refund claim. Judgment was entered against Duke Energy Florida in the amount of approximately   $34 million  , which includes pre-judgment interest. Westinghouse has appealed the trial court's order and Duke Energy Florida has cross-appealed. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the appeal of the trial court's order.    
  On March 29, 2017, Westinghouse filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York, which automatically stayed the appeal. On May 23, 2017, the bankruptcy court entered an order lifting the stay with respect to the appeal. Briefing of the appeal concluded on October 20, 2017. Oral argument in the appeal was originally set for March 2018 but has tentatively been rescheduled to May 2018, due to scheduling conflicts.

Ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of Duke Energy Florida. See discussion of the 2017 Settlement and the Levy Nuclear Project in Note 4 for additional information regarding recovery of costs related to Westinghouse. The 2017 Settlement does not permit recovery of any amounts paid to resolve this contract litigation. 
  MGP Cost Recovery Action 
  On December 30, 2011, Duke Energy Florida filed a lawsuit against FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy) to recover investigation and remediation costs incurred by Duke Energy Florida in connection with the restoration of two former MGP sites in Florida. Duke Energy Florida alleged that FirstEnergy, as the successor to Associated Gas   Electric Co., owes past and future contribution and response costs of up to   $43 million   for the investigation and remediation of MGP sites. On December 6, 2016, the trial court entered judgment against Duke Energy Florida in the case. In January 2017, Duke Energy Florida appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which has been fully briefed and argued. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this appeal.  
  Duke Energy Ohio 
  Antitrust Lawsuit 
  In January 2008, four plaintiffs, including individual, industrial and nonprofit customers, filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Ohio in federal court in the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs alleged Duke Energy Ohio conspired to provide inequitable and unfair price advantages for certain large business consumers by entering into nonpublic option agreements in exchange for their withdrawal of challenges to Duke Energy Ohio s Rate Stabilization Plan implemented in early 2005. In March 2014, a federal judge certified this matter as a class action. Plaintiffs alleged claims of antitrust violations under the federal Robinson Patman Act as well as fraud and conspiracy allegations under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute and the Ohio Corrupt Practices Act. 
  During 2015, the parties received preliminary court approval of a settlement agreement. Duke Energy Ohio recorded a litigation settlement reserve of   $81 million   classified in Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. Duke Energy Ohio also recognized a pretax charge of   $81 million   in (Loss) Income From Discontinued Operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The settlement agreement was approved at a federal court hearing on April 19, 2016. Distribution of the settlement checks was approved by the court in January 2017 and all settlement amounts have been paid. See Note   2   for further discussion on the Midwest Generation Exit. 
  Other Litigation and Legal Proceedings 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are involved in other legal, tax and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve significant amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants believe the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
  The table below presents recorded reserves based on management s best estimate of probable loss for legal matters, excluding asbestos-related reserves and the exit obligation discussed above related to the termination of an EPC contract. Reserves are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Accounts payable and Other within Current Liabilities. The reasonably possible range of loss in excess of recorded reserves is not material, other than as described above.   

  OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  General 
  As part of their normal business, the Duke Energy Registrants are party to various financial guarantees, performance guarantees and other contractual commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries, investees and other third parties. These guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not fully recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and have unlimited maximum potential payments. However, the Duke Energy Registrants do not believe these guarantees will have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

  Gas Supply and Capacity Contracts 
  Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont routinely enter into long-term natural gas supply commodity and capacity commitments and other agreements that commit future cash flows to acquire services needed in their businesses. These commitments include pipeline and storage capacity contracts and natural gas supply contracts to provide service to customers. Costs arising from the natural gas supply commodity and capacity commitments, while significant, are pass-through costs to customers and are generally fully recoverable through the fuel adjustment or PGA procedures and prudence reviews in North Carolina and South Carolina and under the Tennessee Incentive Plan in Tennessee. In the Midwest, these costs are recovered via the Gas Cost Recovery Rate in Ohio or the Gas Cost Adjustment Clause in Kentucky. The time periods for fixed payments under pipeline and storage capacity contracts are up to   19 years  . The time periods for fixed payments under natural gas supply contracts are up to   three years  . The time period for the natural gas supply purchase commitments is up to   15 years  . 
  Certain storage and pipeline capacity contracts require the payment of demand charges that are based on rates approved by the FERC in order to maintain rights to access the natural gas storage or pipeline capacity on a firm basis during the contract term. The demand charges that are incurred in each period are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as part of natural gas purchases and are included in Cost of natural gas. 
  The following table presents future unconditional purchase obligations under natural gas supply and capacity contracts as of December 31, 2017.

In July 2016, Piedmont issued   $300 million   unsecured notes maturing in November 2046 with an interest rate of   3.64%  . Piedmont has the option to redeem all or part of the notes before May 1, 2046, at a redemption price equal to the greater of a)   100%   of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, and b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate as defined in the indenture, as supplemented, plus   25   basis points and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Piedmont has the option to redeem all or part of the notes on or after May 1, 2046, at   100%   of the principal amounts plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Piedmont used the proceeds to fund capital expenditures, to repay short-term borrowings under Piedmont's commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. 
  Available Credit Facilities 
  In March 2017, Duke Energy amended its Master Credit Facility to increase its capacity from   $7.5 billion   to   $8 billion  , and to extend the termination date of the facility from January 30, 2020, to March 16, 2022. The amendment also added Piedmont as a borrower within the Master Credit Facility. Piedmont's separate   $850 million   credit facility was terminated in connection with the amendment. With the amendment, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy (Parent), have borrowing capacity under the Master Credit Facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the Master Credit Facility has been reduced to backstop issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are also required to each maintain   $250 million   of available capacity under the Master Credit Facility as security to meet obligations under plea agreements reached with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015 related to violations at North Carolina facilities with ash basins. 
  In January 2018, Duke Energy further amended its Master Credit Facility with consenting lenders to extend   $7.65 billion   of our existing $8 billion Master Credit Facility by one year to   March 16, 2023  .  
  The table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under these credit facilities.    

           (a) 
    Represents the sublimit of each borrower. 
              (b) 
    Duke Energy issued   $625 million   of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. The balances are classified as Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility 
  In June 2017, Duke Energy (Parent) entered into a   three  -year   $1.0 billion   revolving credit facility (the Three Year Revolver). Borrowings under this facility will be used for general corporate purposes. 
  As of December 31, 2017,   $500 million   has been drawn under the Three Year Revolver. This balance is classified as Long-Term Debt on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any undrawn commitments can be drawn, and borrowings can be prepaid, at any time throughout the term of the facility. The terms and conditions of the Three Year Revolver are generally consistent with those governing Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility. 
  Piedmont Term Loan Facility 
  In June 2017, Piedmont entered into an   18  -month term loan facility with commitments totaling   $250 million   (the Piedmont Term Loan). Borrowings under the facility will be used for general corporate purposes.  
  As of   December 31, 2017  , the entire   $250 million   has been drawn under the Piedmont Term Loan. This balance is classified as Long-Term Debt on Piedmont's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms and conditions of the Piedmont Term Loan are generally consistent with those governing Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility. 
  Other Debt Matters 
  In September 2016, Duke Energy filed a Registration statement (Form S-3) with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement was filed to replace a similar prior filing upon expiration of its three-year term and also allows for the issuance of common stock by Duke Energy.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Duke Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to   $3 billion   of variable denomination floating-rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than   $1.5 billion   of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor s option at any time. The balance as of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016   was   $986 million   and   $1,090 million  , respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  In January 2017, Duke Energy amended its Form S-3 to add Piedmont as a registrant and included in the amendment a prospectus for Piedmont under which it may issue debt securities in the same manner as other Duke Energy Registrants. 
  Duke Energy guaranteed debt issued by Duke Energy Carolinas of   $650 million   and   $762 million  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  . 
  Money Pool 
  The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, are eligible to receive support for their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating in this arrangement. The money pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, separately manage their cash needs and working capital requirements. Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and payables between money pool participants. Duke Energy (Parent), may loan funds to its participating subsidiaries, but may not borrow funds through the money pool. Accordingly, as the money pool activity is between Duke Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries, all money pool balances are eliminated within Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Money pool receivable balances are reflected within Notes receivable from affiliated companies on the Subsidiary Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Money pool payable balances are reflected within either Notes payable to affiliated companies or Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies on the Subsidiary Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Restrictive Debt Covenants 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio not to exceed   65 percent   for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and   70 percent   for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of   December 31, 2017  , each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses. 
  Other Loans 
  As of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , Duke Energy had loans outstanding of   $701 million  , including   $38 million   at Duke Energy Progress and   $661 million  , including   $39 million   at Duke Energy Progress, respectively, against the cash surrender value of life insurance policies it owns on the lives of its executives. The amounts outstanding were carried as a reduction of the related cash surrender value that is included in Other within Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   
  7  . GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS  
  Duke Energy and Progress Energy have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications, which are issued in the normal course of business. As discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. Duke Energy and Progress Energy enter into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. At   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy and Progress Energy do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under these guarantees. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of the activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  On January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas businesses to shareholders. Guarantees issued by Duke Energy or its affiliates, or assigned to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained with Duke Energy subsequent to the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital) or its affiliates prior to the spin-off remained with Spectra Capital subsequent to the spin-off, except for guarantees that were later assigned to Duke Energy. Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Capital against any losses incurred under certain of the guarantee obligations that remain with Spectra Capital. At   December 31, 2017  , the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees was   $205 million  , the majority of which expires by 2028. 
  Duke Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of certain non-consolidated entities and less than wholly owned consolidated entities. If such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke Energy would be required under the guarantees to make payments on the obligations of the less than wholly owned entity. The maximum potential amount of future payments required under these guarantees as of   December 31, 2017  , was   $326 million  . Of this amount,   $11 million   relates to guarantees issued on behalf of less than wholly owned consolidated entities, with the remainder related to guarantees issued on behalf of third parties and unconsolidated affiliates of Duke Energy. Of the guarantees noted above,   $281 million   of the guarantees expire between 2019 and 2030, with the remaining performance guarantees having no contractual expiration.

In October 2017, ACP executed a   $3.4 billion   revolving credit facility with a stated maturity date of October 2021. Duke Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to support its share of the ACP revolving credit facility. Duke Energy's maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee is limited to   47 percent   of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, which was   $312 million   as of   December 31, 2017  .  
  Duke Energy has guaranteed certain issuers of surety bonds, obligating itself to make payment upon the failure of a wholly owned and former non-wholly owned entity to honor its obligations to a third party. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or former non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy had guaranteed   $81 million   of outstanding surety bonds, most of which have no set expiration. 
  Duke Energy uses bank-issued stand-by letters of credit to secure the performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party or customer. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations to the issuing bank that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy had issued a total of   $449 million   in letters of credit, which expire between 2018 and 2022. The unused amount under these letters of credit was   $66 million  . 
  Duke Energy and Progress Energy have issued indemnifications for certain asset performance, legal, tax and environmental matters to third parties, including indemnifications made in connection with sales of businesses. At   December 31, 2017  , the estimated maximum exposure for these indemnifications was   $89 million  , most of which have no set expiration. For certain matters for which Progress Energy receives timely notice, indemnity obligations may extend beyond the notice period. Certain indemnifications related to discontinued operations have no limitations as to time or maximum potential future payments. 
  Duke Energy recognized   $21 million   and   $13 million  , as of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , respectively, primarily in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the guarantees discussed above. As current estimates change, additional losses related to guarantees and indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the future.  
   
  8  . JOINT OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING AND TRANSMISSION FACILITIES 
  The Duke Energy Registrants maintain ownership interests in certain jointly owned generating and transmission facilities. The Duke Energy Registrants are entitled to a share of the generating capacity and output of each unit equal to their respective ownership interests. The Duke Energy Registrants pay their ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory purchases and operating expenses. The Duke Energy Registrants share of revenues and operating costs of the jointly owned facilities is included within the corresponding line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each participant in the jointly owned facilities must provide its own financing. 
  The following table presents the Duke Energy Registrants' interest of jointly owned plant or facilities and amounts included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All facilities are operated by the Duke Energy Registrants and are included in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment.   

           (a) 
    Jointly owned with North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number 1, NCEMC and Piedmont Municipal Power Agency.

  9  . ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
  Duke Energy records an ARO when it has a legal obligation to incur retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Certain assets of the Duke Energy Registrants  have an indeterminate life, such as transmission and distribution facilities, and thus the fair value of the retirement obligation is not reasonably estimable. A liability for these AROs will be recorded when a fair value is determinable.

The Duke Energy Registrants  regulated operations accrue costs of removal for property that does not have an associated legal retirement obligation based on regulatory orders from state commissions. These costs of removal are recorded as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment. The Duke Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated cost of removal for any nonregulated assets. See Note   4   for the estimated cost of removal for assets without an associated legal retirement obligation, which are included in Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The following table presents the AROs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

           (a) 
    Duke Energy amount includes purchase accounting adjustments related to the merger with Progress Energy.  
              (b) 
    Primarily includes obligations related to asbestos removal. Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont also include AROs related to the retirement of natural gas mains and services. Duke Energy includes AROs related to the removal of renewable energy generation assets.  
     Nuclear Decommissioning Liability 
  AROs related to nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require updated cost estimates for decommissioning nuclear plants every five years. 
  The following table summarizes information about the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs in the table below are stated in 2013 or 2014 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.   

           (a) 
    Amounts for Progress Energy equal the sum of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. 
              (b) 
    Amounts include the Subsidiary Registrant's ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors. 
     Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds 
  Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida each maintain NDTFs that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of their respective nuclear power plants. The NDTF investments are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies including the NRC, FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  
  Use of the NDTF investments is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities including license termination, spent fuel and site restoration. The license termination and spent fuel obligations relate to contaminated decommissioning and are recorded as AROs. The site restoration obligation relates to non-contaminated decommissioning and is recorded to cost of removal within Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table presents the fair value of NDTF assets legally restricted for purposes of settling AROs associated with nuclear decommissioning. Duke Energy Florida is actively decommissioning Crystal River Unit 3 and was granted an exemption from the NRC which allows for use of the NDTF for all aspects of nuclear decommissioning. The entire balance of Duke Energy Florida's NDTF may be applied toward license termination, spent fuel and site restoration costs incurred to decommission Crystal River Unit 3. See Note   16   for additional information related to the fair value of the Duke Energy Registrants' NDTFs.    

  Nuclear Operating Licenses 
  Operating licenses for nuclear units are potentially subject to extension. The following table includes the current expiration of nuclear operating licenses.    

  Duke Energy Florida has requested the NRC terminate the operating license for Crystal River Unit 3 as it permanently ceased operation in February 2013. In January 2018, Crystal River Unit 3 reached a SAFSTOR status.  
  Closure of Ash Impoundments 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to state and federal regulations covering the closure of coal ash impoundments, including the EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act, and other agreements. AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these regulations and agreements.  
  The Coal Ash Act, as amended, requires excavation of the Sutton, Riverbend and Dan River basins by August 1, 2019, and Asheville basins by August 1, 2022. Excavation at these sites may include a combination of transfer of coal ash to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use. Basins at the H.F. Lee, Cape Fear and Weatherspoon sites are required to be closed through excavation no later than August 1, 2028. Excavation at these sites can include conversion of the basin to a lined industrial landfill, transfer of ash to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use. The remaining basins are required to be closed no later than December 31, 2024, through conversion to a lined industrial landfill, transfer to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use, unless certain dam improvement projects and alternative drinking water source projects are completed by October 15, 2018. Upon satisfactory completion of these projects, the closure deadline would be extended to December 31, 2029, and could include closure through the combination of a cap system and a groundwater monitoring system.  
  The Coal Ash Act also required the installation and operation of three large-scale coal ash beneficiation projects to produce reprocessed ash for use in the concrete industry. Duke Energy selected the Buck, H.F. Lee and Cape Fear plants for these projects. Closure at these sites is required to be completed no later than December 31, 2029.  
  The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Closure plans and all associated permits must be approved by NCDEQ before any closure work can begin.  
  The EPA CCR rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. The EPA CCR rule has certain requirements which if not met could initiate impoundment closure and require closure completion within five years. The EPA CCR rule includes extension requirements, which if met could allow the extension of closure completion by up to 10 years.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

The ARO amount recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is based upon estimated closure costs for impacted ash impoundments. The amount recorded represents the discounted cash flows for estimated closure costs based upon either specific closure plans or the probability weightings of the potential closure methods as evaluated on a site-by-site basis. Actual costs to be incurred will be dependent upon factors that vary from site to site. The most significant factors are the method and time frame of closure at the individual sites. Closure methods considered include removing the water from ash basins, consolidating material as necessary and capping the ash with a synthetic barrier, excavating and relocating the ash to a lined structural fill or lined landfill or recycling the ash for concrete or some other beneficial use. The ultimate method and timetable for closure will be in compliance with standards set by federal and state regulations and other agreements. The ARO amount will be adjusted as additional information is gained through the closure and post-closure process, including acceptance and approval of compliance approaches which may change management assumptions, and may result in a material change to the balance. See ARO Liability Rollforward section below for information on revisions made to the coal ash liability during 2017 and 2016. 
  Asset retirement costs associated with the AROs for operating plants and retired plants are included in Net property, plant and equipment and Regulatory assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note   4   for additional information on Regulatory assets related to AROs. 
  Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations. See Note   4   for additional information on recovery of coal ash costs.  
  ARO Liability Rollforward 
  During   2017   and   2016  , the Duke Energy Registrants updated coal ash ARO liability estimates based on additional site-specific information for the related costs, methods and timing of work to be performed. Actual closure costs incurred could be materially different from current estimates that form the basis of the recorded AROs. 
  The following tables present changes in the liability associated with AROs.   

           (a) 
    Duke Energy amount relates to the Piedmont acquisition. See Note   2   for additional information. 
              (b) 
    Substantially all accretion expense for the years ended   December 31, 2017  , and   2016   relates to Duke Energy s regulated electric operations and has been deferred in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment. 
              (c) 
    Amounts primarily relate to ash impoundment closures and nuclear decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3. 
              (d)

During the year ended December 31, 2017, Duke Energy recorded a pretax impairment charge of   $69 million   on a wholly owned non-contracted wind project. The impairment was recorded within Impairment charges on Duke Energy s Consolidated Statements of Operations.   $58 million   of the impairment related to property, plant and equipment and   $11 million   of the impairment related to a net intangible asset; see Note 11 for additional information. The charge represents the excess carrying value over the estimated fair value of the project, which was based on a Level 3 Fair Value measurement that was determined from the income approach using discounted cash flows. The impairment was primarily due to the non-contracted wind project being located in a market that has experienced continued declining market pricing during 2017 and declining long-term forecasted energy and capacity prices, driven by low natural gas prices, additional renewable generation placed in service and lack of significant load growth. 
  The following tables present capitalized interest, which includes the debt component of AFUDC.   

Operating Leases 
  Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment operates various renewable energy projects and sells the generated output to utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities and commercial and industrial customers through long-term contracts. In certain situations, these long-term contracts and the associated renewable energy projects qualify as operating leases. Rental income from these leases is accounted for as Operating Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There are no minimum lease payments as all payments are contingent based on actual electricity generated by the renewable energy projects. Contingent lease payments were   $262 million  ,   $216 million  , and   $172 million   for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . As of   December 31, 2017  , renewable energy projects owned by Duke Energy and accounted for as operating leases had a cost basis of   $3,153 million   and accumulated depreciation of   $459 million  . These assets are principally classified as nonregulated electric generation and transmission assets.

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure 
  The table below outlines Duke Energy's ownership interests in natural gas pipeline companies and natural gas storage facilities.    

           (a) 
    During the year ended December 31, 2017, Piedmont transferred its share of ownership interest in ACP and Constitution to a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy at book value.  
              (b) 
    Piedmont owns the Cardinal, Pine Needle and Hardy Storage investments. 
              (c) 
    Duke Energy includes purchase accounting adjustments related to Piedmont. 
     In October 2017, Duke Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to support its share of the ACP revolving credit facility. See Note 7 for additional information. As a result of the financing, ACP returned capital of   $265 million   to Duke Energy. 
  Piedmont sold its   15 percent   membership interest in SouthStar on October 3, 2016, for   $160 million   resulting in an after tax gain of   $81 million   during the year ended October 31, 2016. Piedmont's Equity in Earnings in SouthStar was   $19 million   for the years ended October 31, 2016, and 2015.  
  For regulatory matters and other information on the ACP, Sabal Trail and Constitution investments, see Notes 4 and 17. 
  Commercial Renewables 
  In 2016, Duke Energy sold its interest in three of the Catamount Sweetwater, LLC wind farm projects. Duke Energy has a   47 percent   ownership interest in each of the two other Catamount Sweetwater, LLC wind farm projects and   50 percent   interest in DS Cornerstone, LLC, which owns wind farm projects in the U.S. 
  Impairment of Equity Method Investments 
  Duke Energy evaluated its investment in Constitution for OTTI as of December 31, 2017. Our impairment assessment uses a discounted cash flow income approach, including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project. Our key inputs involve significant management judgments and estimates, including projections of the project s cash flows, selection of a discount rate and probability weighting of potential outcomes of legal and regulatory proceedings. Based upon these estimates using information known as of December 31, 2017, the fair value of Duke Energy's investment in Constitution approximated its carrying value. As a result, Duke Energy did not recognize any impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2017. However, due to the FERC s January 2018 ruling and the resulting increase in uncertainty, Duke Energy is evaluating the potential to recognize a pretax impairment charge on its investment in Constitution during the first quarter of 2018 of up to the current carrying amount of the investment, net of salvage value and any cash and working capital returned. For additional information on the Constitution investment, see Note 4. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2016, Duke Energy recorded an OTTI of certain wind project investments. The   $71 million   pretax impairment was recorded within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The other-than-temporary decline in value of these investments was primarily attributable to a sustained decline in market pricing where the wind investments are located, projected net losses for the projects and a reduction in the projected cash distribution to the class of investment owned by Duke Energy. 
  Other 
  Duke Energy owns a   17.5 percent   indirect interest in NMC, which owns and operates a methanol and MTBE business in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Duke Energy's economic ownership interest decreased from   25 percent   to   17.5 percent   with the successful startup of NMC's polyacetal production facility in 2017. Duke Energy retains   25 percent   of the board representation and voting rights of NMC. The investment in NMC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

  Equity Method Investments 
  Piedmont has related party transactions as a customer of its equity method investments in natural gas storage and transportation facilities. The following table presents expenses that are included in Cost of natural gas on Piedmont's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   

  Piedmont had accounts payable to its equity method investments of   $2 million   at   December 31, 2017  , and   2016   related to these transactions. These amounts are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Intercompany Income Taxes 
  Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants have a tax sharing agreement with Duke Energy for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. The following table includes the balance of intercompany income tax receivables and payables for the Subsidiary Registrants. 

14  . DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING 
  The Duke Energy Registrants use commodity and interest rate contracts to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk. The primary use of commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against changes in the prices of electricity and natural gas. Piedmont enters into natural gas supply contracts to provide diversification, reliability and natural gas cost benefits to its customers. Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk associated with borrowings. 
  All derivative instruments not identified as NPNS are recorded at fair value as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral related to derivative instruments executed under master netting arrangements is offset against the collateralized derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash impacts of settled derivatives are recorded as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  INTEREST RATE RISK 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance or anticipated issuance of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Interest rate risk is managed by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with changes in interest rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and other financial contracts. In anticipation of certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of forward-starting interest rate swaps may be executed to lock in components of current market interest rates. These instruments are later terminated prior to or upon the issuance of the corresponding debt.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Cash Flow Hedges 
  For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a future transaction, referred to as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings once the future transaction impacts earnings. Amounts for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense over the term of the related debt. See the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for gains and losses reclassified out of AOCI for the years ended   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  . Duke Energy's interest rate derivatives designated as hedges include interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt within the Commercial Renewables business. 
  Undesignated Contracts 
  Undesignated contracts include contracts not designated as a hedge because they are accounted for under regulatory accounting and contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting.  
  Duke Energy s interest rate swaps for its regulated operations employ regulatory accounting. With regulatory accounting, the mark-to-market gains or losses on the swaps are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related costs in the ratemaking process. The accrual of interest on the swaps is recorded as Interest Expense.  
  In August 2016, Duke Energy unwound   $1.4 billion   of forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with the Piedmont acquisition financing described in Note 6. The swaps were considered undesignated as they did not qualify for hedge accounting. Losses on the swaps of   $190 million   are included within Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 2 for additional information related to the Piedmont acquisition. 
  The following tables show notional amounts of outstanding derivatives related to interest rate risk.   

COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
  The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the impact of changes in the prices of electricity purchased and sold in bulk power markets and coal and natural gas purchases, including Piedmont's natural gas supply contracts. Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors including the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets and delivery locations. For the Subsidiary Registrants, bulk power electricity and coal and natural gas purchases flow through fuel adjustment clauses, formula based contracts or other cost sharing mechanisms. Differences between the costs included in rates and the incurred costs, including undesignated derivative contracts, are largely deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Piedmont policies allow for the use of financial instruments to hedge commodity price risks. The strategy and objective of these hedging programs are to use the financial instruments to reduce gas cost volatility for customers.

OBJECTIVE CREDIT CONTINGENT FEATURES 
  Certain derivative contracts contain objective credit contingent features. These features include the requirement to post cash collateral or letters of credit if specific events occur, such as a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. The following tables show information with respect to derivative contracts that are in a net liability position and contain objective credit-risk-related payment provisions.

TRADING SECURITIES 
  Piedmont's investments in debt and equity securities held in rabbi trusts associated with certain deferred compensation plans are classified as trading securities. The fair value of these investments was   $1 million   and   $5 million   as of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , respectively. 
  AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES 
  All other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as AFS. 
  Duke Energy s AFS securities are primarily comprised of investments held in (i) the nuclear decommissioning trust funds (NDTF) at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, (ii) grantor trusts at Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana related to OPEB plans and (iii) Bison. 
  Duke Energy classifies all other investments in debt and equity securities as long term, unless otherwise noted.  
  Investment Trusts 
  The investments within the NDTF investments and the Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana grantor trusts (Investment Trusts) are managed by independent investment managers with discretion to buy, sell and invest pursuant to the objectives set forth by the trust agreements. The Duke Energy Registrants have limited oversight of the day-to-day management of these investments. As a result, the ability to hold investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants. Accordingly, all unrealized losses associated with debt and equity securities within the Investment Trusts are considered OTTIs and are recognized immediately.  
  Investments within the Investment Trusts generally qualify for regulatory accounting and accordingly realized and unrealized gains and losses are generally deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.  
  Substantially all amounts of the Duke Energy Registrants' gross unrealized holding losses as of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , are considered OTTIs on investments within Investment Trusts that have been recognized immediately as a regulatory asset. 
  Other AFS Securities 
  Unrealized gains and losses on all other AFS securities are included in other comprehensive income until realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. If an OTTI exists, the unrealized loss is included in earnings based on the criteria discussed below. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants analyze all investment holdings each reporting period to determine whether a decline in fair value should be considered other-than-temporary. Criteria used to evaluate whether an impairment associated with equity securities is other-than-temporary includes, but is not limited to, (i) the length of time over which the market value has been lower than the cost basis of the investment, (ii) the percentage decline compared to the cost of the investment and (iii) management s intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value through a charge to earnings. 
  If the entity does not have an intent to sell a debt security and it is not more likely than not management will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its cost basis, the impairment write-down to fair value would be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, except for when it is determined a credit loss exists. In determining whether a credit loss exists, management considers, among other things, (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, (ii) changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset backed security, the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, (iii) consideration of underlying collateral and guarantees of amounts by government entities, (iv) ability of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments and (v) any changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies. If a credit loss exists, the amount of impairment write-down to fair value is split between credit loss and other factors. The amount related to credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. There were no material credit losses as of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  .  
  Other Investments amounts are recorded in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

  16  . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Fair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. Fair value measurements use market data or assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs may be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize use of unobservable inputs. A midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint price between bid and ask prices) is permitted for use as a practical expedient. 
  Fair value measurements are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy: 
  Level 1     Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. An active market is one in which transactions for an asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information. 
  Level 2     A fair value measurement utilizing inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for an asset or liability. Inputs include (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and (iii) inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit spreads. A Level 2 measurement cannot have more than an insignificant portion of its valuation based on unobservable inputs. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives, such as over-the-counter forwards, swaps and options; certain marketable debt securities; and financial instruments traded in less than active markets. 
  Level 3     Any fair value measurement which includes unobservable inputs for more than an insignificant portion of the valuation. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value. Level 3 measurements may include longer-term instruments that extend into periods in which observable inputs are not available. 
  Not Categorized     Certain investments are not categorized within the Fair Value hierarchy. These investments are measured based on the fair value of the underlying investments but may not be readily redeemable at that fair value. 
  Fair value accounting guidance permits entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity method investments or the company s own debt, at fair value. The Duke Energy Registrants have not elected to record any of these items at fair value. 
  Transfers between levels represent assets or liabilities that were previously (i) categorized at a higher level for which the inputs to the estimate became less observable or (ii) classified at a lower level for which the inputs became more observable during the period. The Duke Energy Registrant s policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the period. There were   no   transfers between levels during the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . In addition, for Piedmont, there were   no   transfers between levels during the two months ended December 31, 2016, and the years ended October 31, 2016, and 2015. 
  Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows. 
  Investments in equity securities 
  The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ Stock Market. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. There was no after-hours market activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurements.  
  Investments in debt securities 
  Most investments in debt securities are valued using Level 2 measurements because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the market for a particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Commodity derivatives 
  Commodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. Other commodity derivatives, including Piedmont's natural gas supply contracts, are primarily valued using internally developed discounted cash flow models that incorporate forward price, adjustments for liquidity (bid-ask spread) and credit or non-performance risk (after reflecting credit enhancements such as collateral) and are discounted to present value. Pricing inputs are derived from published exchange transaction prices and other observable data sources. In the absence of an active market, the last available price may be used. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation, the commodity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments for gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustments for electricity sales contracts. Duke Energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estimate the fair value of natural gas commodity contracts by a market participant price verification procedure. This procedure provides a comparison of internal forward commodity curves to market participant generated curves. 
  Interest rate derivatives 
  Most over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial models that utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional amounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties. 
  Other fair value considerations 
  See Note   11   for a discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. See Note   2   related to the acquisition of Piedmont in 2016 and the purchase of NCEMPA's ownership interests in certain generating assets in 2015.

OTHER FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
  The fair value and book value of long-term debt, including current maturities, is summarized in the following table. Estimates determined are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could have been settled in current markets. Fair value of long-term debt uses Level 2 measurements.   

  At both   December 31, 2017  , and   December 31, 2016  , fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and commercial paper and nonrecourse notes payable of VIEs are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments and/or because the stated rates approximate market rates. 
   
  17  . VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
  A VIE is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than a simple analysis of voting control. The analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, the adequacy of the equity investment of an entity and the relationship of voting power to the amount of equity invested in an entity. This analysis is performed either upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of an event requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entity s assets or activities. A qualitative analysis of control determines the party that consolidates a VIE. This assessment is based on (i) what party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) what party has rights to receive benefits or is obligated to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The analysis of the party that consolidates a VIE is a continual reassessment.  
  CONSOLIDATED VIEs 
  The obligations of these VIEs discussed in the following paragraphs are nonrecourse to the Duke Energy Registrants. The registrants have no requirement to provide liquidity to, purchase assets of or guarantee performance of these VIEs unless noted in the following paragraphs. 
  No   financial support was provided to any of the consolidated VIEs during the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , or is expected to be provided in the future, that was not previously contractually required. 
  Receivables Financing   DERF/DEPR/DEFR 
  Duke Energy Receivables Finance Company, LLC (DERF), Duke Energy Progress Receivables, LLC (DEPR) and Duke Energy Florida Receivables, LLC (DEFR) are bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. DERF, DEPR and DEFR are wholly owned limited liability companies with separate legal existence from their parent companies and their assets are not generally available to creditors of their parent companies. On a revolving basis, DERF, DEPR and DEFR buy certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and related services from their parent companies. 
  DERF, DEPR and DEFR borrow amounts under credit facilities to buy these receivables. Borrowing availability from the credit facilities is limited to the amount of qualified receivables purchased. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligations is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt. 
  The most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DERF, DEPR and DEFR are the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida consolidate DERF, DEPR and DEFR, respectively, as they make those decisions. 
  Receivables Financing   CRC 
  CRC is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity indirectly owned by Duke Energy. On a revolving basis, CRC buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity, natural gas and related services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. CRC borrows amounts under a credit facility to buy the receivables from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Borrowing availability from the credit facility is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold to CRC. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility are reflected on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt. 
  The proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana receive from the sale of receivables to CRC are typically   75 percent   cash and   25 percent   in the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note is a retained interest in the receivables sold. Depending on collection experience, additional equity infusions to CRC may be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of   $3 million  .

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

CRC is considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, (ii) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity are not performed by the equity holder and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC are funded by Duke Energy. The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of CRC are decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy consolidates CRC as it makes these decisions. Neither Duke Energy Ohio nor Duke Energy Indiana consolidate CRC. 
  Receivables Financing   Credit Facilities 
  The following table outlines amounts and expiration dates of the credit facilities described above.   

  Nuclear Asset-Recovery Bonds   DEFPF 
  Duke Energy Florida Project Finance, LLC (DEFPF) is a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Florida. DEFPF was formed in 2016 for the sole purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance Duke Energy Florida's unrecovered regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3.  
  In June 2016, DEFPF issued   $1,294 million   of senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire nuclear asset-recovery property from Duke Energy Florida. The nuclear asset-recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge from all Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The nuclear asset-recovery bonds are secured by the nuclear asset-recovery property and cash collections from the nuclear asset-recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Florida. For additional information see Notes   4   and   6  . 
  DEFPF is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Duke Energy Florida has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE as described above and therefore Duke Energy Florida is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates DEFPF. 
  The following table summarizes the impact of DEFPF on Duke Energy Florida's Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  Commercial Renewables 
  Certain of Duke Energy s renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. Assets are restricted and cannot be pledged as collateral or sold to third parties without prior approval of debt holders. The activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these renewable energy facilities were decisions associated with siting, negotiating PPAs, engineering, procurement and construction and decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke Energy consolidates the entities as it is responsible for all of these decisions.  
  The table below presents material balances reported on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets related to renewables VIEs.

           (a) 
    Duke Energy holds a   50 percent   equity interest in Duke-American Transmission Company, LLC (DATC). As of December 31, 2016, DATC was considered a VIE due to having insufficient equity to finance its own activities without subordinated financial support. However, DATC is no longer considered a VIE based on sufficient equity to finance its own activities, and, therefore, is no longer considered a VIE as of December 31, 2017. Duke Energy's investment in DATC was   $46 million   at December 31, 2017. 

(a) 
    In April 2017, Piedmont transferred its non-consolidated VIE investments to a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. See Note   12   and the "Pipeline Investments" section below for additional detail. 
     The Duke Energy Registrants are not aware of any situations where the maximum exposure to loss significantly exceeds the carrying values shown above except for the power purchase agreement with OVEC, which is discussed below, and various guarantees, some of which are reflected in the table above as Other noncurrent liabilities. For more information on various guarantees, refer to Note   7  . 
  Pipeline Investments 
  Duke Energy has investments in various joint ventures with pipeline projects currently under construction. These entities are considered VIEs due to having insufficient equity to finance their own activities without subordinated financial support. Duke Energy does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of these VIEs and therefore does not consolidate these entities.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

The table below presents Duke Energy's ownership interest and investment balance in in these joint ventures.   

  Commercial Renewables 
  Duke Energy has investments in various renewable energy project entities. Some of these entities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. Duke Energy does not consolidate these VIEs because power to direct and control key activities is shared jointly by Duke Energy and other owners. 
  Other VIEs 
  Duke Energy holds a   50 percent   equity interest in Pioneer. Pioneer is considered a VIE due to having insufficient equity to finance their own activities without subordinated financial support. The activities that most significantly impact Pioneer's economic performance are decisions related to the development of new transmission facilities. The power to direct these activities is jointly and equally shared by Duke Energy and the other joint venture partner, American Electric Power, therefore Duke Energy does not consolidate Pioneer. 
  OVEC 
  Duke Energy Ohio s   9 percent   ownership interest in OVEC is considered a non-consolidated VIE due to having insufficient equity to finance their activities without subordinated financial support. As a counterparty to an inter-company power agreement (ICPA), Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement to buy power from OVEC s power plants through June 2040 commensurate with its power participation ratio, which is equivalent to Duke Energy Ohio's ownership interest. Costs, including fuel, operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization, and interest expense are allocated to counterparties to the ICPA based on their power participation ratio. The value of the ICPA is subject to variability due to fluctuation in power prices and changes in OVEC's cost of business, including costs associated with its 2,256 MW of coal-fired generation capacity. Deterioration in the credit quality, or bankruptcy of one or more parties to the ICPA could increase the costs of OVEC. In addition, certain proposed environmental rulemaking could result in future increased cost allocations. 
  CRC 
  See discussion under Consolidated VIEs for additional information related to CRC. 
  Amounts included in Receivables from affiliated companies in the above table for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to CRC. These subordinated notes held by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are stated at fair value. Carrying values of retained interests are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between assets sold and interests retained based on relative fair value. The allocated bases of the subordinated notes are not materially different than their face value because (i) the receivables generally turnover in less than two months, (ii) credit losses are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration and (iii) the equity in CRC is subordinate to all retained interests and thus would absorb losses first. The hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interests assuming both a   10 percent   and a   20 percent   unfavorable variation in credit losses or discount rates is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history. Interest accrues to Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana on the retained interests using the acceptable yield method. This method generally approximates the stated rate on the notes since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent. An impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interests and purchased beneficial interest whenever it is determined that an OTTI has occurred. 
  Key assumptions used in estimating fair value are detailed in the following table.   

  The following table shows the gross and net receivables sold.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

The following table shows sales and cash flows related to receivables sold.   

  Cash flows from the sales of receivables are reflected within Cash Flows From Operating Activities on Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Collection fees received in connection with servicing transferred accounts receivable are included in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of money, is the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of   1.00 percent  . 
   
  18  . COMMON STOCK 
  Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common shares, such as stock options and equity forward sale agreements, were exercised or settled. Duke Energy s participating securities are restricted stock units that are entitled to dividends declared on Duke Energy common stock during the restricted stock unit s vesting periods. 
  The following table presents Duke Energy s basic and diluted EPS calculations and reconciles the weighted average number of common stock outstanding to the diluted weighted average number of common stock outstanding.   

           (a) 
    Performance stock awards were not included in the dilutive securities calculation because the performance measures related to the awards had not been met. 
     Equity Distribution Agreement 
  On February 20, 2018, Duke Energy filed a prospectus supplement and executed an Equity Distribution Agreement (the EDA) under which it may sell up to   $1 billion   of its common stock through an at-the-market offering program, including an equity forward sales component. The EDA was entered into with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the Agents). Under the terms of the EDA, Duke Energy may issue and sell, through either of the Agents, shares of common stock during the period ending September 23, 2019. 
  In addition to the issuance and sales of shares by Duke Energy through the Agents, Duke Energy may enter into Equity Forward Agreements with affiliates of the Agents as Forward Purchasers. There were no transactions under the EDA from the time of execution of the EDA to the filing of this document.

Stock Issuance 
  In March 2016, Duke Energy marketed an equity offering of   10.6 million   shares of common stock. In lieu of issuing equity at the time of the offering, Duke Energy entered into Equity Forwards with Barclays. The Equity Forwards required Duke Energy to either physically settle the transactions by issuing   10.6 million   shares, or net settle in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. 
  On October 5, 2016, following the close of the Piedmont acquisition, Duke Energy physically settled the Equity Forwards in full by delivering   10.6 million   shares of common stock in exchange for net cash proceeds of approximately   $723 million  . The net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Piedmont acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, all of Piedmont's issued and outstanding stock became the issued and outstanding shares of a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. See Note 2 for additional information related to the Piedmont acquisition. 
  Accelerated Stock Repurchase Program 
  On April 6, 2015, Duke Energy entered into agreements with each of Goldman, Sachs   Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the Dealers) to repurchase a total of   $1.5 billion   of Duke Energy common stock under an accelerated stock repurchase program (the ASR). Duke Energy made payments of   $750 million   to each of the Dealers and was delivered   16.6 million   shares, with a total fair value of   $1.275 billion  , which represented approximately   85 percent   of the total number of shares of Duke Energy common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR. The company recorded the   $1.5 billion   payment as a reduction to common stock as of April 6, 2015. In June 2015, the Dealers delivered   3.2 million   additional shares to Duke Energy to complete the ASR. Approximately   19.8 million   shares, in total, were delivered to Duke Energy and retired under the ASR at an average price of   $75.75   per share. The final number of shares repurchased was based upon the average of the daily volume weighted average stock prices of Duke Energy s common stock during the term of the program, less a discount. 
   
  19  . SEVERANCE 
  As part of its strategic planning processes, Duke Energy implemented targeted cost savings initiatives during 2016 and 2015 aimed at reducing operations and maintenance expense. The initiatives included efforts to reduce costs through the standardization of processes and systems, leveraging technology and workforce optimization throughout the company.  
  During 2016, Duke Energy and Piedmont announced severance plans covering certain eligible employees whose employment will be involuntarily terminated without cause as a result of Duke Energy's acquisition of Piedmont. These reductions continue to be implemented and are a part of the synergies expected to be realized with the acquisition. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on the Piedmont acquisition. 
  Severance benefit costs for initiatives and plans discussed above were accrued for a total of approximately   100   employees in 2017,   600   employees in 2016 and   900   employees in 2015. The following table presents the direct and allocated severance and related expenses recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants. Amounts are included within Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

   The table below presents the severance liability for past and ongoing severance plans including the plans described above. Amounts for Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio are not material.   

20  . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  The Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan) provides for the grant of stock-based compensation awards to employees and outside directors. The 2015 Plan reserves   10 million   shares of common stock for issuance. Duke Energy has historically issued new shares upon exercising or vesting of share-based awards. However, Duke Energy may use a combination of new share issuances and open market repurchases for share-based awards that are exercised or vest in the future. Duke Energy has not determined with certainty the amount of such new share issuances or open market repurchases.

  Duke Energy's pretax stock-based compensation costs, the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation expense and stock-based compensation costs capitalized are included in the following table.   

  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS 
  Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards generally vest over periods from immediate to   three years  . Fair value amounts are based on the market price of Duke Energy's common stock on the grant date. The following table includes information related to restricted stock unit awards.   

  The following table summarizes information about restricted stock unit awards outstanding.   

  The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $42 million  ,   $38 million   and   $41 million  , respectively. At   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy had   $29 million   of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   twenty-three months  . 
  PERFORMANCE AWARDS 
  Stock-based performance awards generally vest after three years if performance targets are met.

Performance awards granted in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   contain market conditions based on the total shareholder return (TSR) of Duke Energy stock relative to a predefined peer group (relative TSR). These awards are valued using a path-dependent model that incorporates expected relative TSR into the fair value determination of Duke Energy s performance-based share awards. The model uses three-year historical volatilities and correlations for all companies in the predefined peer group, including Duke Energy, to simulate Duke Energy s relative TSR as of the end of the performance period. For each simulation, Duke Energy s relative TSR associated with the simulated stock price at the end of the performance period plus expected dividends within the period results in a value per share for the award portfolio. The average of these simulations is the expected portfolio value per share. Actual life to date results of Duke Energy s relative TSR for each grant are incorporated within the model. For performance awards granted in   2017  , the model used a risk-free interest rate of   1.5 percent  , which reflects the yield on three-year Treasury bonds as of the grant date, and an expected volatility of   17.2 percent   based on Duke Energy's historical volatility over three years using daily stock prices.  
  In addition to TSR, performance awards granted in   2017   and   2016   contain a performance condition based on Duke Energy's cumulative adjusted EPS. Performance awards granted in 2017 also contain a performance condition based on the total incident case rate, one of our key employee safety metrics. The actual number of shares issued will range from zero to 200 percent of target shares depending on the level of performance achieved. 
  The following table includes information related to stock-based performance awards.   

The following table summarizes information about stock-based performance awards outstanding and assumes payout at the target level.   

  No   performance awards vested during the year ended   December 31, 2017  . The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31,   2016   and   2015   was   $25 million   and   $26 million  , respectively. At   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy had   $34 million   of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   twenty-three months  . 
  STOCK OPTIONS  
  Stock options, when granted, have a maximum option term of   10 years   and with an exercise price not less than the market price of Duke Energy's common stock on the grant date. There were no stock options granted or exercised during the year ended   December 31, 2017  . There were no stock options outstanding at   December 31, 2017  . 

The following table summarizes additional information related to stock options exercised and granted.   

  PIEDMONT 
  Prior to Duke Energy's acquisition of Piedmont, Piedmont had an incentive compensation plan that had a series of three-year performance and RSU awards for eligible officers and other participants. The Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) between Duke Energy and Piedmont provided for the conversion of the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 performance awards and the nonvested 2016 RSU award into the right to receive $60 cash per share upon the close of the transaction. In December 2015, Piedmont's board of directors authorized the accelerated vesting, payment and taxation of the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 performance awards, as well as the 2016 RSU award, at the election of the participant. Substantially all participants elected to accelerate the settlement of these awards. As a result of the settlement of these awards,   194 thousand   shares of Piedmont shares were issued to participants, net of shares withheld for applicable federal and state income taxes, at a closing price of $56.85 and a fair value of   $11 million  . The 2016-2018 performance award cycle was approved subsequent to the Merger Agreement and was converted into a Duke Energy RSU award as discussed above at the consummation of the acquisition.

Piedmont's stock-based compensation costs and the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation expense are included in the following table. Piedmont's stock-based compensation costs were not material for the two months ended December 31, 2016.   

21  . EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  
  DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS 
  Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries maintain, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The Duke Energy plans cover most employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings, age or age and years of service and interest credits. Certain employees are eligible for benefits that use a final average earnings formula. Under these final average earnings formulas, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to the sum of percentages of their (i) highest three-year, four-year, or five-year average earnings, (ii) highest three-year, four-year, or five-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation (maximum of   35 years  ), (iii) highest three-year average earnings times years of participation in excess of   35 years  . Duke Energy also maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain executives. The qualified and non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.  
  Duke Energy approved plan amendments to restructure its qualified non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans, effective January 1, 2018. The restructuring involved (i) the spin-off of the majority of inactive participants from two plans into a separate inactive plan and (ii) the merger of the active participant portions of such plans, along with a pension plan acquired as part of the Piedmont transaction, into a single active plan. Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged except that the Piedmont plan's final average earnings formula was frozen as of December 31, 2017, and affected participants were moved into the active plan's cash balance formula. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Inactive Plan will be amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. The longer amortization period is expected to lower Duke Energy's 2018 pretax qualified pension plan expense by approximately   $33 million  .  
  Duke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations. 
  Net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below represent the cost of the respective benefit plan for the periods presented. However, portions of the net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below have been capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. Amounts presented in the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for employees of Duke Energy s shared services affiliate that provide support to the Subsidiary Registrants. These allocated amounts are included in the governance and shared service costs discussed in Note   13  . 
  Duke Energy s policy is to fund amounts on an actuarial basis to provide assets sufficient to meet benefit payments to be paid to plan participants. The following table includes information related to the Duke Energy Registrants  contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans.

Information for Plans with Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets   

Assumptions Used for Pension Benefits Accounting 
  The discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following year s pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected. 
  The average remaining service period of active covered employees is 13 years for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Progress, 12 years for Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, and Duke Energy Florida, 14 years for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana, and nine years for Piedmont.  
  The following tables present the assumptions or range of assumptions used for pension benefit accounting.

Information for Plans with Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets   

Assumptions Used for Pension Benefits Accounting 
  The discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following year s pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected. 
  The average remaining service period of active covered employees is 11 years for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Progress, 14 years for Progress Energy, 15 years for Duke Energy Florida, eight years for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio, and Duke Energy Indiana, and nine years for Piedmont. The following tables present the assumptions used for pension benefit accounting.

  PLAN ASSETS 
  Description and Allocations 
  Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust 
  Assets for both the qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits are maintained in the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Qualified pension and other post-retirement assets related to Piedmont were transferred into the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust during 2017. Approximately   98 percent   of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets were allocated to qualified pension plans and approximately   2 percent   were allocated to other post-retirement plans (comprised of 401(h) accounts), as of   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  . The investment objective of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is to achieve reasonable returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants. 
  As of   December 31, 2017  , Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of   6.50 percent  . The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension plan liability. Hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments.  
  In 2013, Duke Energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. As the funded status of the pension plans increase, the targeted allocation to fixed-income assets may be increased to better manage Duke Energy s pension liability and reduce funded status volatility. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. 
  The Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is authorized to engage in the lending of certain plan assets. Securities lending is an investment management enhancement that utilizes certain existing securities of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust to earn additional income. Securities lending involves the loaning of securities to approved parties. In return for the loaned securities, the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust receives collateral in the form of cash and securities as a safeguard against possible default of any borrower on the return of the loan under terms that permit the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust to sell the securities. The Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust mitigates credit risk associated with securities lending arrangements by monitoring the fair value of the securities loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. The fair value of securities on loan was approximately   $195 million   and   $156 million   at   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , respectively. Cash and securities obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned at   December 31, 2017  , and   2016  , respectively. Securities lending income earned by the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust was immaterial for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits for the Subsidiary Registrants are derived from the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust, as such, each are allocated their proportionate share of the assets discussed below.

The following table includes the target asset allocations by asset class at   December 31, 2017  , and the actual asset allocations for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust.   

           (a) 
    Excludes Piedmont Pension Assets  ,   which had a targeted asset allocation of   60 percent   return-seeking and   40 percent   liability hedging fixed-income. Actual asset allocations were   61 percent   return-seeking and   39 percent   liability hedging fixed-income at December 31, 2016. 
     Other post-retirement assets 
  Duke Energy's other post-retirement assets are comprised of Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts and 401(h) accounts held within the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Duke Energy's investment objective is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants.   
  The following table presents target and actual asset allocations for the VEBA trusts at   December 31, 2017  .   

  Fair Value Measurements 
  Duke Energy classifies recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements based on the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note   16  . 
  Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows: 
  Investments in equity securities 
  Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the reporting period. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. Prices have not been adjusted to reflect after-hours market activity. The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. When the price of an institutional commingled fund is unpublished, it is not categorized in the fair value hierarchy, even though the funds are readily available at the fair value. 
  Investments in corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities 
  Most debt investments are valued based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most debt valuations are Level 2 measurements. If the market for a particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3. U.S. Treasury debt is typically Level 2. 
  Investments in short-term investment funds 
  Investments in short-term investment funds are valued at the net asset value of units held at year end and are readily redeemable at the measurement date. Investments in short-term investment funds with published prices are valued as Level 1. Investments in short-term investment funds with unpublished prices are valued as Level 2.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Investments in real estate limited partnerships 
  Investments in real estate limited partnerships are valued by the trustee at each valuation date (monthly). As part of the trustee s valuation process, properties are externally appraised generally on an annual basis, conducted by reputable, independent appraisal firms, and signed by appraisers that are members of the Appraisal Institute, with the professional designation MAI. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three valuation techniques that can be used to value investments in real estate assets: the market, income or cost approach. The appropriateness of each valuation technique depends on the type of asset or business being valued. In addition, the trustee may cause additional appraisals to be performed as warranted by specific asset or market conditions. Property valuations and the salient valuation-sensitive assumptions of each direct investment property are reviewed by the trustee quarterly and values are adjusted if there has been a significant change in circumstances related to the investment property since the last valuation. Value adjustments for interim capital expenditures are only recognized to the extent that the valuation process acknowledges a corresponding increase in fair value. An independent firm is hired to review and approve quarterly direct real estate valuations. Key inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value includes among others, rental revenue and expense amounts and related revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. Development investments are valued using cost incurred to date as a primary input until substantive progress is achieved in terms of mitigating construction and leasing risk at which point a discounted cash flow approach is more heavily weighted. Key inputs and assumptions in addition to those noted above used to determine the fair value of development investments include construction costs and the status of construction completion and leasing. Investments in real estate limited partnerships are valued at net asset value of units held at year end and are not readily redeemable at the measurement date. Investments in real estate limited partnerships are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust  
  The following tables provide the fair value measurement amounts for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust qualified pension and other post-retirement assets.   

           (a) 
    Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana, and Piedmont were allocated approximately   27 percent  ,   30 percent  ,   15 percent  ,   15 percent  ,   5 percent  ,   8 percent  , and   4 percent  , respectively, of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust at   December 31, 2017  . Accordingly, all amounts included in the table above are allocable to the Subsidiary Registrants using these percentages. 
              (b) 
    Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS 
  Retirement Savings Plan 
  Duke Energy or its affiliates sponsor, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, employee savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees. Most employees participate in a matching contribution formula where Duke Energy provides a matching contribution generally equal to   100 percent   of employee before-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions of up to   6 percent   of eligible pay per pay period (  5 percent   for Piedmont employees). Dividends on Duke Energy shares held by the savings plans are charged to retained earnings when declared and shares held in the plans are considered outstanding in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS. 
  As of January 1, 2014, for new and rehired non-union and certain unionized employees (excludes Piedmont employees until 2018 plan year, discussed below) who are not eligible to participate in Duke Energy s defined benefit plans, an additional employer contribution of   4 percent   of eligible pay per pay period, which is subject to a three-year vesting schedule, is provided to the employee s savings plan account.  
  The following table includes pretax employer matching contributions made by Duke Energy and expensed by the Subsidiary Registrants.   

   Money Purchase Pension Plan 
  Piedmont sponsors the MPP plan, which is a defined contribution pension plan that allows employees to direct investments and assume risk of investment returns. Under the MPP plan, Piedmont annually deposits a percentage of each participant s pay into an account of the MPP plan. This contribution equals   4 percent   of the participant s eligible compensation plus an additional   4 percent   of eligible compensation above the Social Security wage base up to the IRS compensation limit. The participant is vested in MPP plan after three years of service.   No   contributions were made to the MPP plan during the two months ended December 31, 2016. Piedmont contributed   $2 million   to the MPP plan during each of the years ended December 31, 2017, October 31, 2016 and 2015. Effective December 31, 2017, the MPP Plan was merged into the Retirement Savings Plan and the money purchase plan formula was discontinued. Beginning with the 2018 plan year, the former MPP Plan participants are eligible to receive the additional employer contribution under the Retirement Savings Plan, discussed above. 
   
  22  . INCOME TAXES 
  Tax Act 
  On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. Among other provisions, the Tax Act lowers the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated utilities, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act also could be amended or subject to technical correction, which could change the financial impacts that were recorded at December 31, 2017, or are expected to be recorded in future periods. The FERC and state utility commissions will determine the regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Act for the Subsidiary Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants  future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the Tax Act, subsequent amendments or corrections or the actions of the FERC, state utility commissions or credit rating agencies related to the Tax Act. Duke Energy is reviewing orders to address the rate treatment of the Tax Act by each state utility commission in which the Subsidiary Registrants operate. See Note 4 for additional information. Beginning in January 2018, the Subsidiary Registrants will defer the estimated ongoing impacts of the Tax Act that are expected to be returned to customers. 
  As a result of the Tax Act, Duke Energy revalued its existing deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, to account for the estimated future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred tax amounts. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, where the reduction in the net accumulated deferred income tax (ADIT) liability is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the net remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. The regulatory liability for income taxes includes the effect of the reduction of the net deferred tax liability including the tax gross-up of the excess accumulated deferred tax liabilities and the effect of the new tax rate on the previous regulatory asset for income taxes. Excess accumulated deferred income taxes are generally classified as either  protected  or  unprotected  under IRS rules. Protected excess ADIT, resulting from accumulated tax depreciation of public utility property, are required to utilize the average rate assumption method under the IRS normalization rules for determining the timing of the return to customers. The majority of the excess ADIT is related to protected amounts associated with public utility property. See Note 4 for additional information on the Tax Act's impact to the regulatory asset and liability accounts.

  Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the Tax Act s impact. SAB 118 provides a measurement period, which in no case should extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date, during which a company acting in good faith may complete the accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act under ASC Topic 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of the Tax Act in the reporting period in which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is complete. To the extent that a company s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete, a company can determine a reasonable estimate for those effects and record a provisional estimate in the financial statements in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined.  
  Duke Energy recorded a provisional net tax benefit of   $112 million   related to the Tax Act in the period ending December 31, 2017. This net benefit primarily consists of a net benefit of   $534 million   due to the remeasurement of deferred tax accounts to reflect the corporate rate reduction impact to net deferred tax balances, a net expense for the establishment of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits of   $406 million   and a transition tax on previously untaxed earnings and profits on foreign subsidiaries of   $10 million  . The majority of Duke Energy s operations are regulated and it is expected that the Subsidiary Registrants will ultimately pass on the savings associated with the amount representing the remeasurement of deferred tax balances related to regulated operations to customers. Duke Energy recorded a regulatory liability of   $8,313 million  , representing the revaluation of those deferred tax balances. The Subsidiary Registrants continue to respond to requests from regulators in various jurisdictions to determine the timing and magnitude of savings they will pass on to customers. 
  The net provisional charge from deferred tax remeasurement and assessment of valuation allowance is based on currently available information and interpretations which are continuing to evolve. Duke Energy continues to analyze additional information and guidance related to certain aspects of the Tax Act, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest and executive compensation, conformity or decoupling by state legislatures in response to the Tax Act, and the final determination of the net deferred tax liabilities subject to the remeasurement. The prospects of supplemental legislation or regulatory processes to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, or evolving technical interpretations of the tax law, may also cause the final impact from the Tax Act to differ from the estimated amounts. Duke Energy continues to appropriately refine such amounts within the measurement period allowed by SAB 118, which will be completed no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.

  In February 2016, Duke Energy announced it had initiated a process to divest the International Disposal Group and, accordingly, no longer intended to indefinitely reinvest post-2014 undistributed foreign earnings. This change in the company's intent, combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by Congress in late 2015, allowed Duke Energy to more efficiently utilize foreign tax credits and reduce U.S. deferred tax liabilities associated with the historical unremitted foreign earnings by approximately   $95 million   during the year ended December 31, 2016. 
  Due to the classification of the International Disposal Group as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, income tax amounts related to the International Disposal Group's foreign earnings are presented within   (Loss) Income From Discontinued Operations, net of tax   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. 
  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   December 31, 2017  , and, based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   December 31, 2017  , and have concluded no change has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. 
  Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Duke Energy Registrants  internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Due to inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
  The Duke Energy Registrants  management, including their Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2017  , based on the framework in the Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of   December 31, 2017  . 
  Deloitte   Touche LLP, Duke Energy s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke Energy s internal control over financial reporting. This attestation report is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This report is not applicable to the Subsidiary Registrants as these companies are not accelerated or large accelerated filers.

PART II 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation 
  Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by COSO. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
  Basis for Opinion 
  The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying   Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(1)    As of   December 31, 2017  , no options were outstanding under equity compensation plans. 
           (2) 
    Includes restricted stock units and performance shares (assuming the maximum payout level) granted under the Duke Energy Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan or the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as well as shares that could be payable with respect to certain compensation deferred under the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Savings Plan (Executive Savings Plan) or the Duke Energy Corporation Directors' Savings Plan (Directors  Savings Plan).  
              (3) 
    Includes shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to stock awards under the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
              (4) 
    Includes shares that could be payable with respect to certain compensation deferred under the Executive Savings Plan or and the Directors' Savings Plan, each of which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan described in more detail below. Upon the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc., performance shares granted prior to such acquisition under the Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan were converted into restricted stock units payable in shares of Duke Energy common stock. As of December 31, 2017, 45,173 such restricted stock units were outstanding. Following the acquisition, no further stock awards were permitted to be granted under the Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan. These converted awards are not listed in the table above. 
              (5) 
    The number of shares remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans not approved by security holders cannot be determined because it is based on the amount of future voluntary deferrals, if any, under the Executive Savings Plan and the Directors' Savings Plan. 
     Under the Executive Savings Plan, participants can elect to defer a portion of their base salary and short term incentive compensation. Participants also receive a company matching contribution in excess of the contribution limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code under the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan, which is the 401(k) plan in which employees are generally eligible to participate. In general, payments are made following termination of employment or death in the form of a lump sum or installments, as selected by the participant. Participants may direct the deemed investment of base salary deferrals, short-term incentive compensation deferrals and matching contributions among investment options available under the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan, including the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund. Participants may change their investment elections on a daily basis. Deferrals of equity awards are credited with earnings and losses based on the performance of the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund. The benefits payable under the plan are unfunded and subject to the claims of Duke Energy s creditors. 
  Under the Directors  Savings Plan, outside directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual compensation, generally consisting of retainers. Deferred amounts are credited to an unfunded account, the balance of which is adjusted for the performance of phantom investment options, including the Duke Energy common stock fund, as elected by the director, and generally are paid when the director terminates his or her service from the Board of Directors. 
  
   262

In the event the cost of any of these services may exceed the fee limits, the Audit Committee must specifically approve the service.

 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 10.24 

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
    
    Duke Energy Corporation   (the "Corporation") grants to the individual named below ("Grantee"), in accordance with the terms of the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the "Plan") and this   Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement   (the "Agreement"), the following number of Restricted Stock Units (the "Award"), on the Date of Grant set forth below: 
                 Name of Grantee: 

Number of Restricted Stock Units: 

Date of Grant: 

Vesting Dates: 

Section 1.        Nature of Restricted Stock Units  .   Each Restricted Stock Unit, upon becoming vested, represents a right to receive payment in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock (a "Share").  Restricted Stock Units are used solely as units of measurement and are not Shares, and Grantee is not, and has no rights as, a shareholder of the Corporation by virtue of this Award. 
    Section 2.        Vesting of Restricted Stock Units  .  Subject to Section 3 and 6 below, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest as follows: 
  (a)  The Restricted Stock Units shall vest in equal installments on each vesting date set forth above (each a "Vesting Date") (subject to rounding conventions adopted by the Corporation from time to time; provided that in no event will the total Shares issued exceed the total units granted under the Award), provided that Grantee shall have remained in the continuous employ of the Corporation or a Subsidiary through the applicable Vesting Date.   
    
  (b)        Notwithstanding Section 2(a), the Restricted Stock Units that have not yet vested under this Section 2 shall immediately vest if, prior to the applicable Vesting Date: (i) Grantee ceases to be employed with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries by reason of death or Disability (defined by reference Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), or (ii) a Change in Control occurs and the Corporation and its Subsidiaries terminate Grantee's employment other than for cause (as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion), or Grantee's employment terminates under circumstances that entitle Grantee to severance benefits under an employment or change in control agreement with the Corporation or a Subsidiary, or a severance plan maintained by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case within the two-year period commencing on the Change in Control. 
  (c)        Notwithstanding Sections 2(a) or 2(b), a pro-rated portion of the Restricted Stock Units that has not yet vested under this Section 2 shall immediately vest if, prior to the applicable Vesting Date (and other than as provided in Section 2(b)(ii) above): (i) the Corporation and its Subsidiaries terminate Grantee's employment other than for cause, death or Disability, including  

as a result of the divestiture of assets, a business or a company by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, or (ii) Grantee voluntarily terminates employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries after having attained age 55 and completed 10 years of consecutive service from Grantee's most recent date of hire or re-hire, as applicable (as determined under such rules as may be established by the Corporation from time-to-time)("Retirement"). The pro-rated portion of the Restricted Stock Units that becomes vested under this Section 2(c), if any, shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, based upon Grantee's continuous employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries from the Date of Grant through the date of termination of employment (including additional service credit provided to Grantee, if any, under an employment agreement with the Corporation or a Subsidiary, or a severance plan maintained by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, as applicable). 
  (d)        For purposes of Section 2 of this Agreement, the continuous employment of Grantee with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to have been interrupted, and Grantee shall not be deemed to have ceased to be an employee, by reason of the transfer of his or her employment among the Corporation and its Subsidiaries or a leave of absence approved by the Corporation or a Subsidiary; provided that, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Corporation shall pro-rate the vesting of Restricted Share Units in the event Grantee is on an approved but unpaid leave of absence, based upon the portion of the applicable vesting period during which Grantee received payment of salary (as determined under such rules as may be established by the Corporation from time-to-time).     
  Section 3.        Forfeiture  .  The Restricted Stock Units that have not yet vested pursuant to Section 2 (including without limitation any right to Dividend Equivalents described in Section 5 hereof relating to dividends payable on or after the date of forfeiture) shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice if (a) Grantee ceases to be employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary other than as provided in Sections 2(b) or 2(c), or (b) the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, determines that Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 6.   
  Section 4.        Payment of Restricted Stock Units  .   
  (a)        Except as provided in Section 4(b) below, payment of vested Restricted Stock Units shall be made to Grantee within 60 days following the date the units become vested in accordance with Section 2, except to the extent deferred by Grantee in accordance with procedures as the Committee, or its delegate, may prescribe from time to time.   
  (b)        To the extent Grantee's right to receive payment of the Restricted Stock Units constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (because, for example, Grantee is Retirement eligible (or could become Retirement eligible during the term of this Agreement) or is a party to a Change in Control Agreement with the Corporation), then notwithstanding Section 4(a) hereof, payment of vested Restricted Stock Units shall be made to Grantee within 60 days following the earlier of: (i) Grantee's "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; provided, however, that if Grantee is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (as determined pursuant to the Company's policy for identifying specified employees) on the date of the Grantee's separation from service, then to the extent required to comply with Section 409A of the Code, payment shall be delayed until the first business day that is more than six months after the date of his or her separation from service; or (ii) the applicable Vesting Date(s) as provided in Section 2(a). 
  
   2 

(c)        Payment of vested Restricted Stock Units shall be in the form of one (1) Share for each full Restricted Stock Unit; provided that if payment would be less than ten (10) Shares, or if payment would result in fractional shares, then, if so determined by the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, payment may be made in cash in lieu of Shares.   
  Section 5.        Dividend Equivalent Payments  .  With respect to each Restricted Stock Unit, Grantee shall be entitled to a cash payment (without interest) equal to the cash dividends declared and payable with respect to one (1) Share for each record date that occurs during the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the Restricted Stock Unit is paid (the "Dividend Equivalent").  The right to any Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited to the extent that the underlying Restricted Stock Unit is forfeited.  Dividend Equivalents shall be paid to Grantee at the same time that the related cash dividend is paid to shareholders of the Corporation. Dividend Equivalents will be subject to any required withholding for federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes. 
  Section 6  .           Restrictive Covenants  .   
  (a)  In consideration of the Award, Grantee agrees that during the period ending on the ________ anniversary of the Date of Grant ("Restricted Period"), Grantee shall not for any reason, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Corporation or its delegate: (i) become employed, engaged or involved with a competitor (defined below) of the Corporation or any Subsidiary in a position that involves: providing services that relate to or are similar in nature or purpose to the services performed by Grantee for the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time during his or her previous ______ years of employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary; or, supervision, management, direction or advice regarding such services; either as principal, agent, manager, employee, partner, shareholder, director, officer or consultant (other than as a less-than three percent (3%) equity owner of any corporation traded on any national, international or regional stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market); or (ii) induce or attempt to induce any customer, client, supplier, employee, agent or independent contractor of the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries to reduce, terminate, restrict or otherwise alter (to the Corporation's detriment) its business relationship with the Corporation.   
  (b)       The noncompetition obligations of clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to a "competitor" of the Corporation or any Subsidiary which is understood to mean any person or entity in competition with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, and more particularly those persons and entities engaged in any business in which the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, is engaged at the termination of Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries; and within the following geographical areas: (i) any country in the world (other than the United States) where the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has at least $25 million in capital deployed as of the termination of Grantee's employment; (ii) the states of Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee, and (iii) any other state in the United States where the Corporation, including the Subsidiaries, has at least $25 million in capital deployed as of the termination of Grantee's employment.  The Corporation and Grantee intend the above restrictions on competition in geographical areas to be entirely severable and independent, and any invalidity or unenforceability of this provision with respect to any one or more of such restrictions, including geographical areas, shall not render this provision unenforceable as applied to any one or more of the other restrictions, including geographical areas.   
    
  (c)        Grantee agrees not to: (i) disclose to any third party or otherwise misappropriate any confidential or proprietary information of the Corporation or of any Subsidiary (except as  
  
   3 

required by subpoena or other legal process, in which event Grantee will give the Chief Legal Officer of the Corporation prompt notice of such subpoena or other legal process in order to permit the Corporation or any affected individual to seek appropriate protective orders); or (ii) publish or provide any oral or written statements about the Corporation or any Subsidiary, any of the Corporation's or any Subsidiary's current or former officers, executives, directors, employees, agents or representatives that are false, disparaging or defamatory, or that disclose private or confidential information about their business or personal affairs.   The obligations of this paragraph are in addition to, and do not replace, eliminate, or reduce in any way, all other contractual, statutory, or common law obligations Grantee may have to protect the Corporation's confidential information and trade secrets and to avoid defamation or business disparagement. 
    
  (d)       Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit, restrict or otherwise discourage Grantee from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a "Government Agency"), from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations, or from participating in "protected activity" as defined in 10 CFR 50.7 and Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, including, without limitation, reporting any suspected instance of illegal activity of any nature, any nuclear safety concern, any workplace safety concern, any public safety concern, or any other matter within the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission's ("NRC") regulatory responsibilities to the NRC or any other Government Agency.  Grantee does not need prior authorization of any kind to engage in such activity or make any such reports or disclosures to any Government Agency and Grantee is not required to notify the Corporation that Grantee has made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right Grantee may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency. 
    
  (e)       If any part of this Section is held to be unenforceable because of the duration, scope or geographical area covered, the Corporation and Grantee agree to modify such part, or that the court making such holding shall have the power to modify such part, to reduce its duration, scope or geographical area. 
    
  (f)        Nothing in Section 6 shall be construed to prohibit Grantee from being retained during the Restricted Period in a capacity as an attorney licensed to practice law, or to restrict Grantee from providing advice and counsel in such capacity, in any jurisdiction where such prohibition or restriction is contrary to law.  Notwithstanding any provisions of this Award to the contrary, Grantee may be entitled to immunity and protection from retaliation under the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 for disclosing a trade secret under limited circumstances, as set forth in the Corporation's Innovations - Inventions, Patents and Intellectual Properties Policy.   
    
             (g)       Grantee's agreement to the restrictions provided for in this Agreement and the Corporation's agreement to provide the Award are mutually dependent consideration. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if Grantee materially breaches any provision of this Section 6 or if the enforceability of any material restriction on Grantee provided for in this Agreement is challenged and found unenforceable by a court of law, then the Corporation shall, at its election, have the right to (i) cancel the Award, (ii) recover from Grantee any Shares or Dividend Equivalents or other cash paid under Award, or (iii) with respect to any Shares paid under the Award that have been disposed of, require Grantee to repay to the Corporation the fair market value of such Shares on the date such shares were sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by Grantee.   This provision shall be construed as a return of consideration or ill-gotten gains due to  
  
   4 

the failure of Grantee's promises under the Agreement, and not as a liquidated damages clause.  Nothing herein shall (x) reduce or eliminate the Corporation's right to assert that the restrictions provided for in this agreement are fully enforceable as written, or as modified by a court pursuant to Section 6, or (y) eliminate, reduce, or compromise the application of temporary or permanent injunctive relief as a fully appropriate and applicable remedy to enforce the restrictions provided for in Section 6 (inclusive of its subparts), in addition to recovery of damages or other remedies otherwise allowed by law.  
    
  Section 7  .        Change in Control  .  Vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall not accelerate solely as a result of a Change in Control.  In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing entity, as the case may be, may, without Grantee's consent, either assume or continue the Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award or other consideration in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement. 
       Section 8  .        Withholding  .  To the extent the Corporation or any Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes in connection with the delivery of Shares under this Agreement, then the Corporation or Subsidiary (as applicable) shall retain a number of Shares otherwise deliverable hereunder with a value equal to the required withholding (based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of delivery); provided that in no event shall the value of the Shares retained exceed the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld.  
    Section 9.        Conflicts with Plan, Correction of Errors, Section 409A and Grantee's Consent  .  In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts in any way with a provision of the Plan, such Plan provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this Agreement shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause such Plan provision to be controlling.  Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan. In the event that, due to administrative error, this Agreement does not accurately reflect an Award properly granted to Grantee pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation, acting through its Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, reserves the right to cancel any erroneous document and, if appropriate, to replace the cancelled document with a corrected document.   
    To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement will be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause this Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and made without the consent of Grantee).  For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid to Grantee pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.   
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Award is subject to cancellation by the Corporation in its sole discretion unless Grantee has signed a duplicate of this Agreement, in the space provided below, and returned the signed duplicate to the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department   Restricted Stock Units ________________________________________________________, which, if, and to the extent, permitted by the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, may be accomplished by electronic means.

Performance Period: 
    The three-year period commencing on January 1 of the year in which the Date of Grant occurs  

Section 1.        Nature of Performance Shares  .   Each Performance Share, upon becoming vested, represents a right to receive payment in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock (a "Share").  Performance Shares are used solely as units of measurement and are not Shares, and Grantee is not  ,   and has no rights as, a shareholder of the Corporation by virtue of this Award. 
  Section 2.        Vesting of Performance Shares  .   Subject to Section 3 and 6 below, the Performance Shares shall vest as follows:

  (b)        In general, Grantee must be employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on the last day of the Performance Period to be entitled to payment of any Performance Shares earned under Section 2(a) above.  However, Grantee shall be entitled to a pro-rated portion of the Performance Shares earned under Section 2(a) above in the event that, during the Performance Period (i) Grantee ceases to be employed with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries by reason of death or Disability (defined by reference Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), (ii) the Corporation and its Subsidiaries terminate Grantee's employment other than for cause (as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion), or (iii) Grantee voluntarily terminates employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries after having attained age 55 and completed 10 years of consecutive service from Grantee s most recent date of hire or re-hire, as applicable (as determined under such rules as may be established by the Corporation from time-to-time). The pro-rated portion of the Performance Shares that becomes payable under this Section 2(b), if any, shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, based upon Grantee's continuous employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries during the Performance Period (including additional service credit provided to Grantee, if any, under an employment or change in control agreement with the Corporation or a Subsidiary, or a severance plan maintained by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, as applicable). 

(c)        For purposes of Section 2 of this Agreement, the continuous employment of Grantee with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to have been interrupted, and Grantee shall not be deemed to have ceased to be an employee, by reason of the transfer of his or her employment among the Corporation and its Subsidiaries or a leave of absence approved by the Corporation or a Subsidiary; provided that,     to the extent permitted under applicable law,  the Corporation shall pro-rate the payout of any Performance Shares earned in the event Grantee is on an approved but unpaid leave of absence during the Performance Period, based upon the portion of the Performance Period during which Grantee received payment of salary (as determined under such rules as may be established by the Corporation from time-to-time).     
  Section 3  .        Forfeiture  . The Performance Shares (including without limitation any right to accumulated Dividend Equivalents described in Section 5 hereof) shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice if (a) Grantee ceases to be employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary prior to the last day of the Performance Period other than as provided in Section 2(b), or (b) the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, determines that Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 6.  Grantee acknowledges and agrees that payments made under this Agreement are subject to the Corporation's requirement that the Grantee reimburse the portion of any payment where such portion of the payment was (i) inadvertently paid based on an incorrect calculation, or (ii) predicated upon the achievement of financial results that are subsequently the subject of a restatement caused or partially caused by Grantee's fraud or misconduct.   
  Section 4  .        Payment of Performance Shares  . Payment of the Performance Shares earned under Section 2 above shall be made to Grantee by March 15 of the calendar year immediately following the end of the Performance Period, except to the extent deferred by Grantee in accordance with procedures as the Committee, or its delegate, may prescribe from time to time.     Payment of vested Performance Shares shall be in the form of one (1) Share for each full Performance Share earned; provided that if payment would be less than ten (10) Shares, or if payment would result in fractional shares, then, if so determined by the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, payment may be made in cash in lieu of Shares.   
  Section 5  .        Dividend Equivalents  . Upon payment of a Performance Share, Grantee shall be entitled to a cash payment (without interest) equal to the aggregate cash dividends declared and payable with respect to one (1) Share for each record date that occurs during the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the Performance Share is paid (the "Dividend Equivalent").  The Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited to the extent that the underlying Performance Share is forfeited and shall be paid to Grantee, if at all, at the same time that the related Performance Share is paid in accordance with Section 4 above. Dividend Equivalents will be subject to any required withholding for federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes. 
  Section 6  .        Restrictive Covenants  .   
  (a)  In consideration of the Award, Grantee agrees that during the period ending on the ______ anniversary of the Date of Grant ("Restricted Period"), Grantee shall not for any reason, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Corporation or its delegate: (i) become employed, engaged or involved with a competitor (defined below) of the Corporation or any Subsidiary in a position that involves: providing services that relate to or are similar in nature or purpose to the services performed by Grantee for the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time during his or her previous _____ years of employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary; or, supervision, management, direction or advice regarding such services; either as principal, agent,  
  
   2 

manager, employee, partner, shareholder, director, officer or consultant (other than as a less-than three percent (3%) equity owner of any corporation traded on any national, international or regional stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market); or (ii) induce or attempt to induce any customer, client, supplier, employee, agent or independent contractor of the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries to reduce, terminate, restrict or otherwise alter (to the Corporation's detriment) its business relationship with the Corporation.   
  (b)       The noncompetition obligations of clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to a "competitor" of the Corporation or any Subsidiary which is understood to mean any person or entity in competition with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, and more particularly those persons and entities engaged in any business in which the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, is engaged at the termination of Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries; and within the following geographical areas: (i) any country in the world (other than the United States) where the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has at least $25 million in capital deployed as of the termination of Grantee's employment; (ii) the states of Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee, and (iii) any other state in the United States where the Corporation, including the Subsidiaries, has at least $25 million in capital deployed as of the termination of Grantee's employment.

  (c)   Grantee agrees not to: (i) disclose to any third party or otherwise misappropriate any confidential or proprietary information of the Corporation or of any Subsidiary (except as required by subpoena or other legal process, in which event Grantee will give the Chief Legal Officer of the Corporation prompt notice of such subpoena or other legal process in order to permit the Corporation or any affected individual to seek appropriate protective orders); or (ii) publish or provide any oral or written statements about the Corporation or any Subsidiary, any of the Corporation's or any Subsidiary's current or former officers, executives, directors, employees, agents or representatives that are false, disparaging or defamatory, or that disclose private or confidential information about their business or personal affairs.   The obligations of this paragraph are in addition to, and do not replace, eliminate, or reduce in any way, all other contractual, statutory, or common law obligations Grantee may have to protect the Corporation's confidential information and trade secrets and to avoid defamation or business disparagement. 
  (d)       Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit, restrict or otherwise discourage Grantee from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a "Government Agency"), from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations, or from participating in "protected activity" as defined in 10 CFR 50.7 and Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, including, without limitation, reporting any suspected instance of illegal activity of any nature, any nuclear safety concern, any workplace safety concern, any public safety concern, or any other matter within the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission's ("NRC") regulatory responsibilities to the NRC or any other Government Agency.  Grantee does not need prior authorization of any kind to engage in such activity or make any such reports or disclosures to any Government Agency and Grantee is not required to notify the Corporation that Grantee has made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement  
  
   3 

limits any right Grantee may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency. 
  (e)    If any part of this Section is held to be unenforceable because of the duration, scope or geographical area covered, the Corporation and Grantee agree to modify such part, or that the court making such holding shall have the power to modify such part, to reduce its duration, scope or geographical area. 
  (f)    Nothing in Section 6 shall be construed to prohibit Grantee from being retained during the Restricted Period in a capacity as an attorney licensed to practice law, or to restrict Grantee from providing advice and counsel in such capacity, in any jurisdiction where such prohibition or restriction is contrary to law.  Notwithstanding any provisions of this Award to the contrary, Grantee may be entitled to immunity and protection from retaliation under the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 for disclosing a trade secret under limited circumstances, as set forth in the Corporation's Innovations - Inventions, Patents and Intellectual Properties Policy.   
  (g)   Grantee's agreement to the restrictions provided for in this Agreement and the Corporation's agreement to provide the Award are mutually dependent consideration. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if Grantee materially breaches any provision of this Section 6 or if the enforceability of any material restriction on Grantee provided for in this Agreement is challenged and found unenforceable by a court of law, then the Corporation shall, at its election, have the right to (i) cancel the Award, (ii) recover from Grantee any Shares or Dividend Equivalents or other cash paid under Award, or (iii) with respect to any Shares paid under the Award that have been disposed of, require Grantee to repay to the Corporation the fair market value of such Shares on the date such shares were sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by Grantee.   This provision shall be construed as a return of consideration or ill-gotten gains due to the failure of Grantee's promises under the Agreement, and not as a liquidated damages clause.  Nothing herein shall (x) reduce or eliminate the Corporation's right to assert that the restrictions provided for in this agreement are fully enforceable as written, or as modified by a court pursuant to Section 6, or (y) eliminate, reduce, or compromise the application of temporary or permanent injunctive relief as a fully appropriate and applicable remedy to enforce the restrictions provided for in Section 6 (inclusive of its subparts), in addition to recovery of damages or other remedies otherwise allowed by law.  
  Section 7  .        Change in Control  .   Vesting of the Performance Shares shall not accelerate solely as a result of a Change in Control.  In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing entity, as the case may be, may, without Grantee's consent, either assume or continue the Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award or other consideration in substitution for the Performance Shares subject to this Agreement. 
  Section 8  .        Withholding  . To the extent the Corporation or any Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes in connection with the delivery of Shares under this Agreement, then the Corporation or Subsidiary (as applicable) shall retain a number of Shares otherwise deliverable hereunder with a value equal to the required withholding (based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of delivery); provided that in no event shall the value of the Shares retained exceed the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld.  If the Corporation or any Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local or other taxes at any time other than upon delivery of the Shares under this Agreement (for example, if Grantee elects to defer payment of the Performance Shares), then the Corporation or Subsidiary (as applicable)  
  
   4 

shall have the right in its sole discretion to (a) require Grantee to pay or provide for payment of the required tax withholding, or (b) deduct the required tax withholding from any amount of salary, bonus, incentive compensation or other amounts otherwise payable in cash to Grantee (other than deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code).       
  Section 9  .        Conflicts with Plan, Correction of Errors, Section 409A and Grantee's Consent  .  In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts in any way with a provision of the Plan, such Plan provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this Agreement shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause such Plan provision to be controlling.  Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan. In the event that, due to administrative error, this Agreement does not accurately reflect an Award properly granted to Grantee pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation, acting through its Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, reserves the right to cancel any erroneous document and, if appropriate, to replace the cancelled document with a corrected document.   
    To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement will be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause this Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and made without the consent of Grantee).  For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid to Grantee pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.   
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Award is subject to cancellation by the Corporation in its sole discretion unless Grantee has signed a duplicate of this Agreement, in the space provided below, and returned the signed duplicate to the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department - Performance Shares ________________________________________________________, which, if, and to the extent, permitted by the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, may be accomplished by electronic means. 
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Agreement to be executed effective as of the Date of Grant.

EXHIBIT A 
  PERFORMANCE GOALS 
  Cumulative Adjusted EPS (____%) 
  _______% of the Target Number of Performance Shares subject to this Award shall become vested based upon the extent to which the Corporation achieves the "Cumulative Adjusted EPS Performance Goal," which is based on the Corporation's cumulative adjusted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the Performance Period, in accordance with the applicable vesting percentage specified for Cumulative Adjusted EPS in the following schedule:  
                 Cumulative Adjusted EPS  
    Percent Payout of 
  Target Performance Shares* 

*When such determination is at a level between those specified, the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, shall interpolate to determine the applicable vesting percentage.  The Committee shall have the authority to calculate and adjust the Cumulative Adjusted EPS and the Cumulative Adjusted EPS Performance Goal in the same manner as adjusted diluted EPS is calculated and adjusted pursuant to the ____ Short-Term Incentive Program Guidelines. 
  Total Shareholder Return (____%) 
  _____% of the Target Number of Performance Shares subject to this Award shall become vested based upon the extent to which the Corporation achieves the "TSR Performance Goal," which is the Corporation's Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") percentile ranking among the companies that are in the Philadelphia Utility Index as of the beginning of the Performance Period, with higher percentile ranking for more positive/less negative TSR, for the Performance Period, in accordance with the applicable vesting percentage specified for such percentile ranking in the following schedule:  
                 Relative TSR Performance Percentile  
    Percent Payout of 
  Target Performance Shares** 

**When such determination is of a percentile ranking between those specified, the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, shall interpolate to determine the applicable vesting percentage.  If the Corporation's TSR is at least ______% during the Performance Period, the vesting percentage for this portion of the Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents shall not be less than _____%, and if the Corporation's TSR is less than _____% during the Performance Period, the vesting percentage for this portion of the Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents shall not be more than ______%. 
  
   7 

For purposes of this Agreement, TSR means, with respect to any company, the percentage change in total stockholder return, determined by dividing (A) the difference between the price of a share of the company's common stock from the Opening Value (as defined below) to the Closing Value (as defined below), with any dividends with ex-dividend dates falling inside the Performance Period deemed reinvested in the company's common stock on the ex-dividend date, by (B) the Opening Value.  The term "Opening Value" means, with respect to any company, the average of the closing prices per share of the company's common stock on each trading day during the calendar month preceding the start of the Performance Period, assuming any dividends with ex-dividend dates falling inside such calendar month are deemed reinvested in the company's common stock on the ex-dividend date.  The term "Closing Value" means, with respect to any company, the average of the closing prices per share of the company's common stock on each trading day during the last calendar month of the Performance Period, assuming any dividends with ex-dividend dates falling inside such calendar month are deemed reinvested in the company's common stock on the ex-dividend date. In the event that a company becomes a member of the Philadelphia Utility Index following ________________, or if a member of the Philadelphia Utility Index on _____________ ceases to exist during the Performance Period as a separate publicly-traded company due to a merger, acquisition or privatization, such company shall not be taken into account for purposes of this Agreement.  If a member of the Philadelphia Utility Index on ________________ becomes bankrupt or insolvent during the Performance Period and ceases to be publicly-traded, for purposes of this Agreement its TSR shall be -100%. 
  Total Incident Case Rate For Employees (____%) 
  ______% of the Target Number of Performance Shares subject to this Award shall become vested based upon the extent to which the Corporation achieves the "TICR Performance Goal," which is the Corporation's total incident case rate for employees ("TICR") as compared to the applicable vesting percentage specified in the following schedule:  
                 Total Incident Case Rate for Employees  
    Percent Payout of 
  Target Performance Shares*** 

***When such determination is at a level between those specified, the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, shall interpolate to determine the applicable vesting percentage. The employees of any company acquired during the Performance Period shall not be taken into account when measuring the Corporation's TICR for the Performance Period. 
  Adjustments 
  If the Committee determines that a merger, consolidation, liquidation, issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, spin-off, split-off, stock split, reverse stock split or other distribution with respect to the Shares, or any similar corporate transaction or event in respect of the Shares, the manner in which the Corporation conducts its business, changes in the law or regulations or regulatory structure, changes in accounting practices, other unusual or nonrecurring items or occurrences, or other events or circumstances, render the Performance Goals to be unsuitable, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, and without the  
  
   8 

consent of the Grantee or any other persons, modify the calculation of the Performance Goals, or any of the related minimum, target or maximum levels of achievement, or the performance results, in whole or in part, as the Committee deems equitable and appropriate to reflect such event.    
  In addition, the Committee reserves the right to reduce any vesting to the extent the Committee determines that such reduction is equitable and appropriate for any reason, including reductions based on overall financial performance, such as adjusted and reported earnings, capital deployment and credit position during the Performance Period.
