   Merger
with Progress Energy.   
On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy completed the merger contemplated by the Agreement
and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement), among Duke Energy, Diamond Acquisition
Corporation, a North Carolina corporation and Duke Energy s wholly owned
subsidiary (Merger Sub) and Progress Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy), a North
Carolina corporation engaged in the regulated utility business of generation,
transmission and distribution and sale of electricity in portions of North
Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. As a result of the merger, Merger Sub was
merged into Progress Energy and Progress Energy became a wholly owned
subsidiary of Duke Energy.  

  The
merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy provides increased scale and
diversity with potentially enhanced access to capital over the long term and a
greater ability to undertake the significant construction programs necessary to
respond to increasing environmental regulation, plant retirements and customer
demand growth. Duke Energy s business risk profile is expected to improve over time
due to the increased proportion of the business that is regulated.
Additionally, cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits are expected from
the combined operations.  

  Immediately
preceding the merger, Duke Energy completed a one-for-three reverse stock split
with respect to the issued and outstanding shares of Duke Energy common stock.
The shareholders of Duke Energy approved the reverse stock split at Duke
Energy s special meeting of shareholders held on August 23, 2011. All share and
per share amounts presented within the Form 10-K reflect the impact of the
one-for-three reverse stock split.  

  Progress
Energy s shareholders received 0.87083 shares of Duke Energy common stock in exchange
for each share of Progress Energy common stock outstanding as of July 2, 2012.
Generally, all outstanding Progress Energy equity-based compensation awards
were converted into Duke Energy equity-based compensation awards using the same
ratio. The merger was structured as a tax-free exchange of shares.  

  For
additional information on the details of this transaction including regulatory
conditions and accounting implications, see Item 7,  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and Note 2 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Acquisitions and Dispositions of
Businesses and Sales of Other Assets.   

   Duke
Energy Business Segments.    Duke Energy conducts its operations in the following
business segments, all of which are considered reportable segments under the
applicable accounting rules: U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas (USFE G),
Commercial Power and International Energy. The remainder of Duke Energy s
operations are presented as Other. Duke Energy s chief operating decision maker
regularly reviews financial information about each of these business segments
in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. For additional
information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic
information about each reportable business segment, see Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Business Segments.    

  The
following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke
Energy s reportable business segments, as well as Other. (For more information
on the operating outlook of Duke Energy and its reportable segments, see
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, Introduction   Executive Overview and Economic Factors for Duke
Energy s Business.    

U.S. FRANCHISED ELECTRIC AND GAS    

U.S.
Franchised Electric and Gas (USFE G) generates, transmits, distributes and
sells electricity in most portions of North Carolina, northern South Carolina,
central, north central and southern Indiana, west central Florida, and northern
Kentucky. USFE G also transmits, distributes and sells electricity in
southwestern Ohio. Additionally, USFE G transports and sells natural gas in
southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. It conducts operations primarily
through Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy
Florida, Duke Energy Indiana, and the regulated transmission and distribution
operations of Duke Energy Ohio (Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio are
collectively referred to as Duke Energy Midwest). These electric and gas
operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC),
the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), the Florida Public
Service Commission (FPSC), the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), and the Kentucky Public Service
Commission (KPSC). The substantial majority of USFE G s operations are regulated
and, accordingly, these operations qualify for regulatory accounting treatment.  

PART I   

USFE G
supplies electric service to 7.2 million residential, general service and
industrial customers. Its service area covers approximately 104,000 square
miles with an estimated population of 22 million. USFE G provides regulated
transmission and distribution services for natural gas to 500,000 customers in
southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. Electricity is also sold wholesale to
incorporated municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load
serving entities.  

  Duke Energy Carolinas 
and Progress Energy Carolinas  service areas share a diversified economy that is driven
by service, manufacturing and government related output and jobs. Sales to
general service customers, which include both service and government sectors,
represent approximately one third of total retail sales and the main segments
include health care, education, financial services, information technology and
military buildings. Sales to industrial customers represent a little less than
one third of total retail sales and key sectors are textiles, chemicals, rubber
and plastics, paper, food   beverage and auto manufacturing.   

  Progress Energy
Florida s
service area has a strong base of residential customers and lower percentages
of general service and industrial customers relative to the other Duke Energy
utilities  states. Sales to general service customers, which include both
service and government sectors, represent approximately 40% of total retail
sales; the largest service segments include tourism, heath care and
agriculture. Sales to industrial customers represent only around 10% of total
retail sales and main sectors include phosphate rock mining and processing,
electronics design and manufacturing, and citrus and other food processing.  

  Duke Energy Indiana s service area is
characterized by a strong presence of manufacturing activity. Sales to
industrial customers represent around 40% of total retail volumes; the larger
segments within the industrial class include primary metals, transportation
equipment, building materials, food   beverage and chemicals. Sales to
general service customers represent approximately 30% of total retail and the
largest contributors to general service sales include retail, financial, health
care and education services.   

  Duke Energy Ohio s service area has a
diversified economy that is driven by primarily by the services sector. The
contribution of manufacturing to the regional economy is lower relative to
Indiana and the Carolinas  service territories. Sales to general service
customers, which include both service and government sectors, represent
approximately 40% of total retail sales and the main segments include
healthcare, education, real estate and rental leasing, financial  
insurance services and wholesale trade services. Sales to industrial customers
represent approximately one fourth of total retail sales and key industries are
aerospace, primary metals, chemicals and food.   

  The number of
residential, general service and industrial customers within the USFE G
service territory, as well as sales to these customers, is expected to increase
over time. However, growth in the near-term is being hampered by the current
economic conditions. While total industrial sales increased in 2012 when
compared to 2011, the growth rate was modest when compared to historical
periods.   

Seasonality
and the Impact of Weather   

USFE G s
costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns. Peak sales of
electricity occur during the summer and winter months, resulting in higher
revenue and cash flows during those periods. By contrast, fewer sales of
electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant
maintenance during those periods. Peak gas sales occur during the winter
months. Residential and general service customers are most impacted by weather.
Industrial customers are less weather sensitive. Estimated weather impacts are
based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions,
with normal weather conditions defined as the long-term average of actual
historical weather conditions.  

  The
estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers,
temperature variances from a normal condition and customers  historic usage levels
and patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not
and cannot consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather
conditions such as humidity and relative temperature changes. The precision of
this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to
shorter term periods.  

  Degree-day
data are used to estimate the energy required to maintain comfortable indoor
temperatures based on each day s average temperature. Heating-degree days
measure the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average
daily temperature falls below a base temperature, and cooling-degree days
measure the variation in weather based on the extent to which the average daily
temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below
the base temperature counts as one heating-degree day and each degree of
temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling-degree day.  

Competition   

Retail.
   USFE G s
regulated utility businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within
their service territories. USFE G owns and operates all of the businesses
and facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity.
Services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the
costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital.
This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at
fair prices. USFE G s competition in the regulated electric distribution
business is primarily from the on-site generation of industrial customers.  

  USFE G
is not aware of any enacted or proposed legislation in North Carolina, South
Carolina, Florida, Kentucky or Indiana that would give its retail customers the
right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or
deregulate the electric industry. However, USFE G competes with suppliers
of other forms of energy in connection with their retail customers.   

  Although
there is no pending legislation at this time, if the retail jurisdictions
served by USFE G become subject to deregulation, the recovery of  stranded
costs  could become a significant consideration. Stranded costs primarily
include the generation assets of USFE G s regulated utilities whose value
in a competitive marketplace would be less than their current book value, as
well as above-market purchased power commitments to qualified facilities (QFs).
QFs are
typically small power production facilities that generate power within a
utility company s service territory for which the utility companies are legally
obligated to purchase the energy of these facilities at an avoided cost rate. Thus far, all states
that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to
recover a substantial portion of stranded costs.   

  USFE G s
largest stranded cost exposure is primarily related to Progress Energy
Florida s purchased power commitments with QFs, under which it has future
minimum expected capacity payments through 2025 of $3.8 billion. Progress
Energy Florida was obligated to enter into these contracts under provisions of
the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Progress Energy Florida
continues to seek ways to address the impact of escalating payments under these
contracts. However, the FPSC allows full recovery of the retail portion of the
cost of power purchased from QFs. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies  for additional information related
these purchased power commitments.  

   Wholesale.
   USFE G
competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales and
for sales to municipalities and cooperatives. USFE G also competes with
other utilities and marketers in the wholesale electric business. The principal
factors in competing for wholesale sales are price (including fuel costs),
availability of capacity and power and reliability of service. Wholesale
electric prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs.  

10   

PART I   

Increased
competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of
transmission access could affect USFE G s load forecasts, plans for power
supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales
will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to
sell to the wholesale market and the ability of USFE G to attract new
wholesale customers and to retain current wholesale customers.  

Energy
Capacity and Resources    

USFE G
owns over 50,000 megawatts of generation capacity. For additional information on
USFE G s generation facilities, see  U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas  in
Item 2. Properties.   

  Energy
and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and
purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause USFE G to purchase
power for its customers include generating plant outages, extreme weather
conditions, generation reliability during the summer, growth, and price.
USFE G has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities
to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and
energy, and reliability of power supply.   

  USFE G s
generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different
operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the
lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve native-load customers. All
options, including owned generation resources and purchased power
opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and
dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.  

  The vast
majority of Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, and Duke Energy
Indiana s customer energy needs have historically been met by large,
low-energy-production-cost coal-fired and nuclear generating units that
operated almost continuously (or at baseload levels). However, recent commodity
pricing trends have resulted in more combined cycle gas-fired generation. The
vast majority of Progress Energy Florida s customer energy needs have
historically been met by large, low-energy-production-cost nuclear, fossil
steam and combined cycle gas-fired generation. However, due to the extended
outage of the Crystal River Nuclear Station Unit 3 (Crystal River Unit 3)
nuclear plant a portion of customer needs have been served with purchased power
for the past 3 years.  

  CT s and
CC s are less expensive to build and maintain than either nuclear or coal, and
can be rapidly started or stopped as needed to meet changing customer loads or
operated as base load units depending on commodity prices. Hydroelectric units
produce low-cost energy, but their operations are limited by the availability
of water flow.  

  USFE G s
pumped-storage hydroelectric facilities in the Carolinas offer the added
flexibility of using low-cost off-peak energy to pump water that will be stored
for later generation use during times of higher-cost on-peak periods. These
facilities allow USFE G to maximize the value spreads between different
high- and low-cost generation periods.  

   Recently
Completed Generation Projects.    During 2012 and 2011, USFE G completed
construction of and placed into service a total of 3,585 megawatts (MW) of new
generation capacity including Cliffside Unit 6 and the Buck, Dan River, Lee and
Smith combined cycle natural gas facilities. The total capital cost of this new
generation capacity was $4.8 billion.  

   Generation
Projects Currently Under Construction.    The following information relates to
generation projects currently under construction by USFE G.   

    Edwardsport
Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)Plant.     Duke Energy Indiana has
completed the construction and is conducting testing of a 618 MW Integrated
Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant at its existing Edwardsport
Generating Station in Knox County, Indiana.   

  On
December 27, 2012, the IURC approved the settlement agreement finalized in
April 2012  between Duke Energy Indiana, the Office of Utility Consumer
Counselor (OUCC), the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel
Indiana, on the cost increase for the construction of the Edwardsport IGCC
plant. The settlement agreement, as approved, caps costs to be reflected in
customer rates at $2.595 billion, including estimated allowance for funds used
during construction (AFUDC) through June 30, 2012. Duke Energy Indiana was
allowed to recover AFUDC after June 30, 2012 until customer rates are revised,
with such recovery decreasing to 85% on AFUDC accrued after November 30, 2012.  

  Duke Energy Indiana s
current cost estimate for the Edwardsport IGCC plant is approximately $3.154
billion, excluding financing costs. Through December 31, 2012, Duke Energy
Indiana has recorded total pre-tax impairment and other charges of $897 million
related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant. If cost estimates for the plant
increase, additional charges to expense, which could be material, could occur.
The Edwardsport IGCC plant is expected to be in service by mid-2013. See Note 4
to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters  for further
information.  

    L.V. Sutton Combined
Cycle Facility.     
   Progress
Energy Carolinas is in the process of constructing an approximately 625 MW
natural gas-fired generating facility at its existing L.V. Sutton Steam Station
(Sutton) in New Hanover County, North Carolina. The Sutton project has an
expected in-service date of December 2013. Based on updated cost estimates,
total costs (including AFUDC) for the Sutton project is estimated to be
approximately $600 million.  

   Potential New
Construction.   
The following information relates to major generation projects currently being
evaluated for construction by USFE G.  

    Shearon Harris Nuclear
Station Expansion.    
In 2006, Progress
Energy Carolinas selected a site at its existing Shearon Harris Nuclear Station
(Harris) to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion. On February 19,
2008, Progress Energy Carolinas filed its combined Construction and Operating
License (COL) application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for two
Westinghouse Electric Advanced Passive (AP) 1000 reactors at Harris, which the
NRC docketed on April 17, 2008. No petitions to intervene have been admitted in
the Harris COL application.  

    Levy
Nuclear Station.    
On July 30, 2008, Progress Energy Florida filed its COL application with the
NRC for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at its proposed Levy Nuclear Station
(Levy), which the NRC docketed on October 6, 2008. Various parties filed a
joint petition to intervene in the Levy COL application. On October 31, 2012
and November 1, 2012, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board held an evidentiary
hearing on portions of the intervention petitions.  A decision is expected in
March 2013. In 2008, the FPSC granted Progress Energy Florida s petition for an
affirmative Determination of Need and related orders requesting cost recovery
under Florida s nuclear cost-recovery rule for Levy, together with the
associated facilities, including transmission lines and substation facilities.   

  On April
30, 2012, as part of its annual nuclear cost recovery filing, Progress Energy
Florida updated the Levy project schedule and cost. Due to lower-than-projected
customer demand, the lingering economic slowdown, uncertainty regarding
potential carbon regulation and current low natural gas prices, Progress Energy
Florida has shifted the in-service date for the first Levy unit to 2024, with
the second unit following 18 months later. The revised schedule is consistent
with the recovery approach included in the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement.
Although the scope and overnight cost for Levy, including land acquisition,
related transmission work and other required investments, remain essentially
unchanged, the shift in schedule will increase escalation and carrying costs
and raise the total estimated project cost to between $19 billion and $24
billion.  

11   

PART I   

Along with the FPSC s annual prudence
reviews, Progress Energy Florida will continue to evaluate the project on an
ongoing basis based on certain criteria, including, but not limited to, cost;
potential carbon regulation; fossil fuel prices; the benefits of fuel
diversification; public, regulatory and political support; adequate financial
cost-recovery mechanisms; appropriate levels of joint owner participation;
customer rate impacts; project feasibility; demand side management (DSM) and energy
efficiency (EE) programs; and availability and terms of capital financing. Taking
into account these criteria, Levy is considered to be Progress Energy Florida s
preferred baseload generation option.  

  Under
the terms of the 2012 FSPC Settlement Agreement, Progress Energy Florida began
residential cost-recovery of its proposed Levy Nuclear Station effective in the
first billing cycle of January 2013 at the fixed rates contained in the
settlement and continuing for a five-year period, with true-up of any actual
costs not recovered during the five year period occurring in the final year.
Progress Energy Florida will not file for recovery of any new Levy costs that
were not addressed in the 2012 FSPC Settlement Agreement before March 1, 2017
and will not begin recovering those costs from customers before the first
billing cycle of January, 2018, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to
the agreement. This amount is intended to recover the estimated retail project
costs to date plus costs necessary to obtain the COL and any engineering,
procurement and construction cancellation costs, if Progress Energy Florida
ultimately chooses to cancel that contract. In addition, the consumer parties
will not oppose Progress Energy Florida continuing to pursue a COL for Levy.
The 2012 FSPC Settlement Agreement also provides that Progress Energy Florida
will treat the allocated wholesale cost of Levy (approximately $68 million) as
a retail regulatory asset and include this asset as a component of rate base
and amortization expense for regulatory reporting. Progress Energy Florida will
have the discretion to accelerate and/or suspend such amortization in full or
in part provided that it amortizes all of the regulatory asset by December 31,
2016.   

    William States Lee III
Nuclear Station.         In December 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an
application with the NRC, which has been docketed for review, for a combined
COL for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors for the proposed William States Lee
III Nuclear Station (Lee Nuclear Station) at a site in Cherokee County, South
Carolina. Each reactor is capable of producing 1,117 MW. Submitting the COL
application does not commit Duke Energy Carolinas to build nuclear units.
Through several separate orders, the NCUC and PSCSC have concurred with the
prudency of Duke Energy incurring project development and pre-construction
costs.  

   Potential Plant
Retirements.    The
Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with
their state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted
energy needs over a long term (15-20 years), and options being considered to
meet those needs. The IRP s filed by the Subsidiary Registrants in 2012 and
2011 included planning assumptions to potentially retire by 2015, certain
coal-fired generating facilities in North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana and
Ohio that do not have the requisite emission control equipment, primarily to
meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that are not yet
effective. Additionally, management is considering the impact pending
environmental regulations might have on certain coal-fired generating
facilities in Florida. These facilities total approximately 3,954 MW at eight
sites. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these
coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful
lives, and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be
otherwise recovered when any assets are retired. For additional information
related to potential plant retirements see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Regulatory Matters.   

Fuel
Supply    

USFE G relies
principally on coal, natural gas and nuclear fuel for its generation of
electric energy. The following table lists USFE G s sources of power and
fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2012.   

Coal.
   USFE G
meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and
short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased
under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and
at the surface. USFE G uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements
not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts,
which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range
from 2013 to 2018 for the Carolinas, 2013 to 2016 for Florida, and 2013 to 2018
for Indiana. USFE G expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar
contracts with other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required
as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal
markets change. The coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from
mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. The
coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in Central
Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. The coal purchased for Indiana is primarily
produced in Indiana and Illinois. USFE G has an adequate supply of coal
under contract to fuel its projected 2013 operations and a significant portion
of supply to fuel its projected 2014 operations. Coal inventory levels have
increased during the past year due to the impact of mild winter weather and the
economy on retail load and low natural gas prices which are resulting in higher
combined cycle gas-fired generation. If these factors continue for an extended
period of time, USFE G could have excess levels of coal inventory.  

12   

PART I   

The
current average sulfur content of coal purchased by USFE G is between 1%
and 2% for the Carolinas; between 1% and 2% for Florida, and between 2% and 3%
for Indiana. USFE G s scrubbers, in combination with the use of sulfur
dioxide (SO 2 ) emission allowances, enable USFE G to satisfy
current SO 2  emission limitations for its existing facilities.  

   Nuclear.
   The
industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve
the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the
services to convert uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the services
to enrich the uranium hexafluoride, and the services to fabricate the enriched
uranium hexafluoride into usable fuel assemblies.   

  USFE G
has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors
in the Carolinas and Florida. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and
enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of
long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country
of origin and pricing. USFE G staggers its contracting so that its
portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements
in the near-term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time
thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have
been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the
technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services,
USFE G generally sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a
plant-by-plant basis using multi-year contracts.   

  USFE G
has entered into fuel contracts that, based on its current need projections,
cover 100% of its uranium concentrates, conversion services, and enrichment
services requirements through at least 2013 and cover fabrication services
requirements for these plants through at least 2018. The cost of termination of
nuclear fuel procurement contracts that Progress Energy Florida has related to
Crystal River Unit 3 are not expected to be material. For subsequent years, a
portion of its fuel requirements are covered by long-term contracts. For future
requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, USFE G believes
it will be able to renew contracts as they expire, or enter into similar
contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and
services.   

   Gas.    Oil and natural gas
supply for USFE G s generation fleet is purchased under term and spot
contracts from various suppliers. Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolina s
use derivative instruments to limit their exposure to price fluctuations for
natural gas. Progress
Energy Florida uses derivative instruments to limit its exposure to price
fluctuations for natural gas, fuel oil and surcharges embedded in coal
transportation agreements. USFE G has dual-fuel generating facilities that
can operate with both fuel oil and natural gas. The cost of USFE G s oil and
natural gas is either at a fixed price or determined by market prices as
reported in certain industry publications. USFE G believes that it has
access to an adequate supply of oil and gas for the reasonably foreseeable
future. USFE G s natural gas transportation for its gas generation is
purchased under term firm transportation contracts with interstate and
intrastate pipelines. USFE G may also purchase additional shorter-term
transportation for its load requirements during peak periods. Many of the
natural gas plants can be served by several supply zones and multiple
pipelines.  

   Purchased
Power.   
USFE G purchased approximately 19.8 million MWh, 19.0 million MWh and 18.3
million MWh of its system energy requirements during 2012, 2011, and 2010,
respectively, under purchase obligations and leases and had 4,500 MW of firm
purchased capacity under contract during 2012. These amounts include MWh for
Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida for all periods
presented. These agreements include approximately 682 MW of firm capacity under
contract by Progress Energy Florida with certain QFs. USFE G may need to
acquire additional purchased power capacity in the future to accommodate a
portion of its system load needs. USFE G believes that it can obtain
adequate purchased power to meet these needs. However, during periods of high
demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly
affected.  

   Gas
for Retail Distribution.    USFE G is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent
delivery of natural gas to native load customers in its Ohio and Kentucky
service territories. USFE G s natural gas procurement strategy is to
buy firm natural gas supplies (natural gas intended to be available at all
times) and firm interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter
season (November through March) and during the non-heating season (April
through October) through a combination of firm supply and transportation
capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity. This
strategy allows USFE G to assure reliable natural gas supply for its high
priority (non-curtailable) firm customers during peak winter conditions and
provides USFE G the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm
customers choose alternate gas suppliers under USFE G customer choice/gas
transportation programs. In 2012, firm supply purchase commitment agreements
provided approximately 100% of the natural gas supply. These firm supply
agreements feature two levels of gas supply, specifically (i) base load, which
is a continuous supply to meet normal demand requirements, and (ii) swing load,
which is gas available on a daily basis to accommodate changes in demand due
primarily to changing weather conditions.   

  USFE G
also owns two underground caverns with a total storage capacity of 16 million
gallons of liquid propane. In addition, USFE G has access to 5.5 million
gallons of liquid propane storage and product loan through a commercial
services agreement with a third party. This liquid propane is used in the three
propane/air peak shaving plants located in Ohio and Kentucky. Propane/air peak
shaving plants vaporize the propane and mix it with natural gas to supplement
the natural gas supply during peak demand periods.   

  Duke
Energy Ohio maintains natural gas procurement-price volatility mitigation
programs. These programs pre-arrange percentages of Duke Energy Ohio s seasonal
gas requirements. Duke Energy Ohio uses primarily fixed-price forward contracts
and contracts with a ceiling and floor on the price. As of December 31, 2012,
Duke Energy Ohio had locked in pricing for 22% of its remaining estimated winter
2012/2013 system load requirements.   

Inventory   

Generation
of electricity is capital-intensive. USFE G must maintain an adequate stock
of fuel, materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of
generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31,
2012, the inventory balance for USFE G was $2,987 million. See Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies,  for additional information.   

Nuclear
Insurance and Decommissioning   

USFE G
owns (wholly or partially) 12 nuclear reactors located at seven stations.
Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property,
decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and replacement power expense
coverage. The other joint owners of the jointly owned nuclear reactors
reimburse USFE G for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per
the joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires nuclear plant
owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear
incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which currently
is $12.6 billion. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Commitments and Contingencies   Nuclear Insurance,  for more information.  

  USFE G
has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel
and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, FPSC and the
PSCSC require USFE G regulated utilities to update their cost estimates for
decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years.  

  Duke
Energy Carolinas  most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost
studies were completed in 2009 and showed total estimated nuclear
decommissioning costs, including the cost to decommission plant components not
subject to radioactive contamination, of $3 billion in 2008      

13   

PART I   

dollars.
This estimate includes Duke Energy Carolinas  ownership interest in the jointly
owned nuclear reactors. The other joint owners of the jointly owned nuclear
reactors are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership
interests in the station. The balance of Duke Energy Carolinas  external
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds (NDTF) was $2,354 million as of December
31, 2012 and $2,060 million as of December 31, 2011.   

  Progress
Energy Carolinas  most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost
studies were completed in 2009 and showed total estimated nuclear
decommissioning costs, including the cost to decommission plant components not
subject to radioactive contamination of $3.0 billion in 2009 dollars. This
estimate includes Progress Energy Carolinas  ownership interest in the jointly
owned nuclear reactors. The other joint owners of the jointly owned nuclear
reactors are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership
interests in the station. The balance of Progress Energy Carolinas  external
NDTF was $1,259 million as of December 31, 2012 and $1,088 million as of
December 31, 2011.  

  Progress
Energy Florida s most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies
were completed in 2008. In the Progress Energy Florida 2009 rate case, the FPSC
deferred review of the 2008 nuclear decommissioning study until 2010. While
Progress Energy Florida was not required to prepare a new site-specific nuclear
decommissioning cost study, it was required to update its 2008 study by
incorporating the most currently-available escalation rates.  This update was
filed with the FPSC in December 2010. The FPSC approved this study on April 30,
2012 and showed total estimated nuclear decommissioning costs based on prompt
dismantlement at the end of Crystal River Unit 3 s useful life , including the
cost to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination
of $751 million in 2008 dollars. This estimate includes Progress Energy
Florida s ownership interest in the jointly owned nuclear reactor. The other
joint owners of the jointly owned nuclear reactor are responsible for
decommissioning costs related to their ownership interests in the station. With
the decision in early 2013 to retire Crystal River Unit 3, as discussed below,
it is anticipated that a delayed dismantlement approach to decommissioning,
referred to as SAFSTOR, will be submitted to the NRC for approval. This
decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number of retired domestic
nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted approaches to
decommissioning required by the NRC. Once an updated  site specific
decommissioning study is completed it will be filed with the FPSC. As part of
the evaluation of repairing Crystal River Unit 3, initial estimates of the cost
to decommission the plant under the SAFSTOR option were developed, including
components not subject to radioactive contamination, of $989 million in 2011
dollars. The balance of the external NDTF was $629 million as of December 31,
2012 and $559 million as of December 31, 2011.  

  The
NCUC, FPSC and the PSCSC have allowed USFE G s regulated utilities to
recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected
remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. USFE G believes that
the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the
existing fund balance and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide
for the cost of future decommissioning. See Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations,  for more information.  

  The
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) provides the framework for
development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal
facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The Nuclear Waste Policy
Act of 1982 promotes increased usage of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel
at existing nuclear plants. USFE G will continue to maximize the use of
spent fuel storage capability within its own facilities for as long as
feasible.   

  Under federal law, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the
permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida have contracts with the
DOE for the future storage and disposal of our spent nuclear fuel. Delays have
occurred in the DOE s proposed permanent repository to be located at Yucca
Mountain, Nevada. See Note 5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments
and Contingencies,    for information about
complaints filed by Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida in
the United States Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for its failure to
fulfill its contractual obligation to receive spent fuel from nuclear plants.
Failure to open Yucca Mountain or another facility would leave the DOE open to
further claims by utilities.   

  Until the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel,
Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida will continue to safely
manage their spent nuclear fuel. With certain modifications and additional
approvals by the NRC, including the installation and/or expansion of on-site
dry cask storage facilities at Robinson Nuclear Station (Robinson), Brunswick
Nuclear Station (Brunswick) and   Crystal River Unit 3  ,
the Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida s spent nuclear fuel
storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel
generated by their respective systems through the expiration of the operating
licenses, including any license renewals, for their nuclear generating units.
Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the
expiration of its renewed operating license.  

Regulation

State     

  The NCUC, the PSCSC,
the FPSC, the PUCO, the IURC and the KPSC (collectively, the state utility
commissions) approve rates for retail electric service within their respective
states. In addition, the PUCO and the KPSC approve rates for retail gas
distribution service within their respective states. The state utility commissions,
except for the PUCO, also have authority over the construction and operation of
USFE G s generating facilities. Certificates of Public Convenience and
Necessity  
(  CPCN)
issued by the state utility commissions, as applicable, authorize USFE G to
construct and operate its electric facilities, and to sell electricity to
retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state utility
commission is required for USFE G s regulated operating companies to issue
securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a
level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of
providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested
capital, including equity.  

  Each of the state
utility commissions allows recovery of certain costs through various
cost-recovery clauses, to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic
hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are
prudent. The clauses are in addition to approved base rates. USFE G s
regulated utilities generally do not earn a return on the recovery of eligible
operating expenses under such clauses; however, in certain jurisdictions, they
may earn a return on under-recovered costs. Additionally, the commissions may
authorize a return for specified investments for energy efficiency and
conservation, capacity costs, environmental compliance and utility plant.  

  Fuel, fuel-related
costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by
USFE G s regulated utilities. USFE G uses coal, oil, hydroelectric,
natural gas and nuclear power to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a
diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one
fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for
recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on
operating results of USFE G, unless a commission finds a portion of such
costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs
and recovery from ratepayers can adversely impact the timing of cash flow of
USFE G. Progress Energy Florida is obligated to notify the FPSC and
permitted to file for a midcourse change to the fuel factor between annual fuel
hearings in the event its estimated over- or under-recovery of fuel costs meets
or exceeds a threshold of ten percent of estimated total retail fuel revenues
and, accordingly, has the ability to mitigate the cash flow impacts due to the
timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.  

  The following is a
summary of pending retail base rate case proceedings for each of USFE G s
regulated utilities.  

14   

PART I   

Duke
Energy Carolinas 2013 North Carolina Rate Case.    On February 4, 2013,
Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for an increase in
base rates of approximately $446 million, or an average 9.7% increase in
revenues. The request for increase is based upon an 11.25% return on equity and
a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% long-term debt. The rate increase is
designed primarily to recover the cost of plant modernization, environmental
compliance and the capital additions.  

  Duke Energy Carolinas
expects revised rates, if approved, to go into effect late third quarter of
2013.   

   Progress Energy
Carolinas 2012 North Carolina Rate Case.    On October 12, 2012, Progress Energy
Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for an increase in base rates of
approximately $387 million, or an average 12% increase in revenues. The request
for increase is based upon an 11.25% return on equity and a capital structure
of 55% equity and 45% long-term debt. The rate increase is designed primarily
to recover the cost of plant modernization and other capital investments in
generation, transmission and distribution systems, as well as increased
expenditures for nuclear plants and personnel, vegetation management and other
operating costs. The rate case includes a corresponding decrease in Progress
Energy Carolinas  energy efficiency and demand side management rider, resulting
in a net requested increase of $359 million, or 11% increase in retail
revenues.   

  On February 25,
2013, the North Carolina Public Staff filed with the NCUC a Notice of
Settlement in Principle (Settlement Notice). Pursuant to the Settlement Notice between
Progress Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff, the parties have agreed to a
two year step-in to a total agreed upon net rate increase, with the first year
providing for a $151 million, or 4.7% average increase in rates, and the second
year providing for rates to be increased by an additional $31 million, or 1.0%
average increase in rates.  This second year increase is a result of
Progress Energy Carolinas agreeing to delay collection of financing costs on
the construction work in progress for the Sutton combined cycle natural gas
plant for one year.  The Settlement Notice is based upon a return on
equity of 10.2% and a 53% equity component of the capital structure.    

  Once filed, the actual
settlement agreement will be subject to approval by the NCUC. Progress Energy
Carolinas expects revised rates, if approved, to go into effect June 1, 2013.   

   Duke Energy Ohio 2012
Electric Rate Case.    On
July 9, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application with the PUCO for an
increase in electric distribution rates of approximately $87 million. On
average, total electric rates would increase approximately 5.1% under the
filing. The rate increase is designed to recover the cost of investments in
projects to improve reliability for customers and upgrades to the distribution
system. Pursuant to a stipulation in another case, Duke Energy Ohio will
continue recovering its costs associated with grid modernization in a separate
rider.  

  Duke Energy Ohio
expects revised rates, if approved, to go into effect in the first half of
2013.   

   Duke Energy Ohio 2012
Natural Gas Rate Case.    On July 9, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application
with the PUCO for an increase in natural gas distribution rates of
approximately $45 million. On average, total natural gas rates would increase
approximately 6.6% under the filing. The rate increase is designed to recover
the cost of upgrades to the distribution system, as well as environmental
cleanup of manufactured gas plant sites. In addition to the recovery of costs
associated with the manufactured gas plants, the rate request includes a
proposal for an accelerated service line replacement program and a new rider to
recover the associated incremental cost. The filing also requests that the PUCO
renew the rider recovery of Duke Energy Ohio s accelerated main replacement program
and grid modernization program.  

  On January 4, 2013,
the PUCO Staff filed a staff report recommending that Duke Energy Ohio only be
allowed to recover costs related to manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which
are currently used and useful in the provision of natural gas distribution
service. Duke Energy Ohio filed its objection to the staff report on February
4, 2013.  

  Duke Energy Ohio
expects revised rates, if approved, to go into effect in the first half of
2013.   

  The following is a
summary of recently resolved or settled retail base rate case proceedings for
each of USFE G s regulated utilities.  

   Progress Energy
Florida 2012 FPSC Settlement.    On February 22, 2012, the FPSC approved a
comprehensive settlement agreement among Progress Energy Florida, the Florida
Office of Public Counsel and other consumer advocates. The 2012 FPSC Settlement
Agreement will continue through the last billing cycle of December 2016. The
agreement addresses three principal matters: (i) Progress Energy Florida s
proposed Levy Nuclear Project cost recovery, (ii) the Crystal River Unit 3 delamination
prudence review then pending before the FPSC, and (iii) certain customer rate matters. See Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters   Rate Related
Information,  for additional provisions of the 2012 settlement agreement.  

   Duke Energy Carolinas
2011 North Carolina Rate Case.    On January 27, 2012, the NCUC approved a
settlement agreement between Duke Energy Carolinas and the North Carolina
Utilities Public Staff (Public Staff). The terms of the agreement include an
average 7.2% increase in retail revenues, or approximately $309 million
annually beginning in February 2012. The agreement includes a 10.5% return on
equity and a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% long-term debt.   

  On March 28, 2012, the
North Carolina Attorney General filed a notice of appeal with the NCUC
challenging the rate of return approved in the agreement. On April 17, 2012,
the NCUC denied Duke Energy Carolinas  request to dismiss the notice of appeal.
Briefs were filed on August 22, 2012 by the North Carolina Attorney General and
the   American Association of Retired
Persons   (AARP) with the North Carolina Supreme Court, which is
hearing the appeal. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to dismiss the appeal
on August 31, 2012 and the North Carolina Attorney General filed a response to
that motion on September 13, 2012. Briefs by the appellees, Duke Energy
Carolinas and the Public Staff, were filed on September 21, 2012. The North
Carolina Supreme Court denied Duke Energy Carolinas  motion to dismiss on
procedural grounds and set the matter for oral arguments on November 13, 2012.
Duke Energy Carolinas is awaiting an order.  

   Duke Energy Carolinas
2011 South Carolina Rate Case.    On January 25, 2012, the PSCSC approved a
settlement agreement between Duke Energy Carolinas and the ORS, Wal-Mart Stores
East, LP, and Sam s East, Inc. The Commission of Public Works for the city of
Spartanburg, South Carolina and the Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer District were not
parties to the agreement; however, they did not object to the agreement. The
terms of the agreement include an average 5.98% increase in retail and
commercial revenues, or approximately $93 million annually beginning February 6,
2012. The agreement includes a 10.5% return on equity, a capital structure of
53% equity and 47% long-term debt.  

   Duke Energy Ohio
Standard Service Offer (SSO).    The PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohio s current
Electric Security Plan (ESP) on November 22, 2011. The ESP effectively separates
the generation of electricity from Duke Energy Ohio s retail load obligation
and requires Duke Energy Ohio to transfer its generation assets to a
nonregulated affiliate on or before December 31, 2014. The ESP includes
competitive auctions for electricity supply whereby the energy price is
recovered from retail customers. As a result, Duke Energy Ohio now earns retail
margin on the transmission and distribution of electricity only and not on the
cost of the underlying energy. New rates for Duke Energy Ohio went into effect
for SSO customers on January 1, 2012. The ESP also includes a provision for a
non-bypassable stability charge of $110 million per year to be collected from
January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014.   

15   

PART I   

On
January 18, 2012, the PUCO denied a request for rehearing of its decision on
Duke Energy Ohio s ESP filed by Columbus Southern Power and Ohio Power Company.

nonregulated affiliates with USFE G.   

   Regional Transmission
Organizations (RTO).    PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and   Midwest Independent
Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO)   are the Independent
System Operators (ISO) and the FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke
Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM is the transmission provider
under, and the administrator of, the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (PJM
Tariff), operates the PJM energy, capacity and other markets, and, through
central dispatch, controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system
for the PJM region. MISO is the transmission provider under, and the
administrator of, the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff (MISO Tariff),
operates the MISO energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central
dispatch, controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the MISO
region. Duke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and provides regional transmission
service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. Duke Energy Ohio and the other transmission
owners in PJM have turned over control of their transmission facilities to PJM,
and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of PJM.
Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide,
open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM members at rates
based on the costs of transmission service. Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO
and provides regional transmission service pursuant to the MISO Tariff. Duke
Energy Indiana and the other transmission owners in MISO have turned over
control of their transmission facilities to MISO, and their transmission

  Prior to January 1,
2012, Duke Energy Ohio was a member of MISO. See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for additional information related to
Duke Energy Ohio s RTO realignment from MISO to PJM.  

    Other     

   Nuclear Matters.    The nuclear power
industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term
availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive
waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for
modifications and new plant construction, the technological and financial
aspects of decommissioning plants at the end of their licensed lives, and
requirements relating to nuclear insurance. Nuclear units are periodically
removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages,
repairs, uprates and certain other modifications.  

  USFE G is subject
to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of
its nuclear generating facilities. In 2000, the NRC renewed the operating
license for Duke Energy Carolinas  three Oconee nuclear units through 2033 for
Units 1 and 2 and through 2034 for Unit 3. In 2003, the NRC renewed the
operating licenses for all units at Duke Energy Carolinas  McGuire Nuclear
Station (McGuire) and Catawba Nuclear Station (Catawba). The two McGuire units
are licensed through 2041 and 2043, respectively, while the two Catawba units
are licensed through 2043. The NRC has renewed the operating licenses for all
of Progress Energy Carolinas  nuclear plants. The renewed operating licenses
for Brunswick Unit 1 and Unit 2, Harris and Robinson expire in 2036, 2034, 2046
and 2030, respectively.   

  The
NRC issues orders with regard to security at nuclear plants in response to new
or emerging threats. The most recent orders include additional restrictions on
nuclear plant access, increased security measures at nuclear facilities and
closer coordination with our partners in intelligence, military, law
enforcement and emergency response at the federal, state and local levels.
USFE G is in compliance with the requirements outlined in the orders
through the use of additional security measures until permanent construction
projects are completed in 2013. As the NRC, other governmental entities and the
industry continue to consider security issues, it is possible that more
extensive security plans could be required.  

    Crystal River Unit 3.     In September 2009,
Crystal River Unit 3 began an outage for normal refueling and maintenance as
well as an uprate project to increase its generating capability and to replace
two steam generators. During preparations to replace the steam generators,
workers discovered a delamination (or separation) within the concrete at the
periphery of the containment building, which resulted in an extension of the
outage. After analysis, it was determined that the concrete delamination at
Crystal River Unit 3 was caused by redistribution of stresses in the
containment wall that occurred when an opening was created to accommodate the
replacement of the unit s steam generators. In March 2011, the work to return
the plant to service was suspended after monitoring equipment identified a new
delamination that occurred in a different section of the outer wall after the
repair work was completed and during the late stages of retensioning the
containment building. Crystal River Unit 3 has remained out of service while
Progress Energy Florida conducted an engineering analysis and review of the new
delamination and evaluated possible repair options.   

  Subsequent to March
2011, monitoring equipment has detected additional changes and further damage
in the partially tensioned containment building and additional cracking or
delaminations could occur.   

  Progress
Energy Florida developed a repair plan, which would entail systematically
removing and replacing concrete in substantial portions of the containment
structure walls, which had a preliminary cost estimate of $900 million to $1.3
billion.    

  In March
2012, Duke Energy commissioned an independent review team led by Zapata
Incorporated (Zapata) to review and assess the Progress Energy Florida Crystal
River Unit 3 repair plan, including the repair scope, risks, costs and
schedule. In its final report in late September, Zapata found that the proposed
repair scope appears to be technically feasible, but there were significant
risks that need to be addressed regarding the approach, construction
methodology, scheduling and licensing. Zapata performed four separate analyses
of the estimated project cost and schedule to repair Crystal River Unit 3,
including; (i) an independent review of the proposed repair scope (without
existing assumptions or data), of which Zapata estimated costs of $1.49 billion
with a project duration of 35 months; (ii) a review of Progress Energy
Florida s previous bid information, which included cost estimate data from
Progress Energy Florida, of which Zapata estimated costs of $1.55 billion with
a project duration of 31 months; (iii) an expanded scope of work scenario, that
included the Progress Energy Florida scope plus the replacement of the
containment building dome and the removal and replacement of concrete in the
lower building elevations, of which Zapata estimated costs of approximately
$2.44 billion with a project duration of 60 months, and; (iv) a  worst case 
scenario, assuming Progress Energy Florida performed the more limited scope of
work, and at the conclusion of that work, additional damage occurred in the
dome and in the lower elevations, which forced replacement of each, of which
Zapata estimated costs of $3.43 billion with a project duration of 96 months.
The principal difference between Zapata s estimate and Progress Energy
Florida s previous estimate appears to be due to the respective levels of
contingencies included by each party, including higher project risk and longer
project duration. Progress Energy Florida has filed a copy of the Zapata report
with the FPSC and with the NRC. The FPSC held a status conference on October
30, 2012 to discuss Duke Energy s analysis of the Zapata report.  

16   

PART I   

On
February 5, 2013, following the completion of a comprehensive analysis, Duke
Energy announced its intention to retire Crystal River Unit 3. Duke Energy
concluded that it did not have a high degree of confidence that repair could be
successfully completed and licensed within estimated costs and schedule, and
that it was in the best interests of Progress Energy Florida s customers and
joint owners and Duke Energy s investors to retire the unit. Progress Energy
Florida developed initial estimates of the cost to decommission the plant
during its analysis of whether to repair or retire Crystal River Unit 3. With
the final decision to retire, Progress Energy Florida is working to develop a
comprehensive decommissioning plan, which will evaluate various decommissioning
options and costs associated with each option. The plan will determine resource
needs as well as the scope, schedule and other elements of decommissioning.
Progress Energy Florida intends to use a safe storage (SAFSTOR) option for
decommissioning. Generally, SAFSTOR involves placing the facility into a safe
storage configuration, requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions,
until the eventual dismantling and decontamination activities occur, usually in
40 to 60 years. This decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number
of retired domestic nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted
approaches to decommissioning required by the NRC. Once an updated site
specific decommissioning study is completed it will be filed with the FPSC. As
part of the evaluation of repairing Crystal River Unit 3, initial estimates of
the cost to decommission the plant under the SAFSTOR option were developed
which resulted in an estimate in 2011 dollars of $989 million. See Note 9 for
additional information. Additional specifics about the decommissioning plan are
being developed.  

  Progress
Energy Florida maintains insurance coverage against incremental costs of
replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages at Crystal River
Unit 3 through NEIL. NEIL provides insurance coverage for repair costs for
covered events, as well as the cost of replacement power of up to $490 million
per event when the unit is out of service as a result of these events. Actual replacement
power costs have exceeded the insurance coverage. Progress Energy Florida also
maintains insurance coverage through NEIL s accidental property damage program,
which provides insurance coverage up to $2.25 billion with a $10 million
deductible per claim.   

  Throughout
the duration of the Crystal River Unit 3 outage, Progress Energy Florida worked
with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement
power costs. NEIL has made payments on the first delamination; however, NEIL
has withheld payment of approximately $70 million of replacement power cost
claims and repair cost claims related to the first delamination event. NEIL had
not provided a written coverage decision for either delamination and no
payments were made on the second delamination and no replacement power
reimbursements were made by NEIL since May 2011. These considerations led
Progress Energy Florida to conclude, in the second quarter of 2012, that it was
not probable that NEIL would voluntarily pay the full coverage amounts that
Progress Energy Florida believes them to owe under the applicable insurance
policies. Consistent with the terms and procedures under the insurance coverage
with NEIL, Progress Energy Florida agreed to non-binding mediation prior to
commencing any formal dispute resolution. On February 5, 2013, Progress Energy
Florida announced it and NEIL had accepted the mediator s proposal whereby NEIL
will pay Progress Energy Florida an additional $530 million. Along with the
$305 million which NEIL previously paid, Progress Energy Florida will receive a
total of $835 million in insurance proceeds.  

  As a
result of the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, Progress Energy Florida will be
permitted to recover prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs through its
fuel clause without regard for the absence of Crystal River Unit 3 for the
period from the beginning of the Crystal River Unit 3 outage through December
31, 2016.   

  In
accordance with the terms of the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, with consumer
representatives and approved by the FPSC, Progress Energy Florida retained the
sole discretion to retire Crystal River Unit 3. Progress Energy Florida expects
that the FPSC will review the prudence of the retirement decision in Phase 2 of
the Crystal River Unit 3 delamination regulatory docket. Progress Energy
Florida has also asked the FPSC to review the mediated resolution of insurance
claims with NEIL as part of Phase 3 of this regulatory docket.     Phase 2 and Phase 3
hearings have been tentatively scheduled to begin on June 19, 2013.  

   Progress Energy
Florida did not begin the repair of Crystal River Unit 3 prior to December 31,
2012. Consistent with the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement regarding the timing
of commencement of repairs, Progress Energy Florida recorded a Regulatory
liability of $100 million in the third quarter of 2012 related to replacement
power obligations. This amount is included within fuel used in electric
generation and purchased power in Progress Energy Florida s and Progress
Energy s Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended
December 31, 2012. Progress Energy Florida will refund this replacement power
liability on a pro rata basis based on the in-service date of up to $40 million
in 2015 and $60 million in 2016. This amount is reflected as part of the
purchase price allocation of the merger with Progress Energy in Duke Energy s
Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  Progress
Energy Florida also retained sole discretion to retire the unit without
challenge from the parties to the agreement. As a result, Progress Energy
Florida will be allowed to recover all remaining Crystal River Unit 3
investments and to earn a return on the Crystal River Unit 3 investments set at
its current authorized overall cost of capital, adjusted to reflect a return on
equity set at 70 percent of the current FPSC authorized return on equity, no
earlier than the first billing cycle of January 2017.  

  In
conjunction with the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, Progress Energy
Florida reclassified all Crystal River Unit 3 investments, including property,
plant and equipment; nuclear fuel; inventory; and deferred assets to a
regulatory asset account. At December 31, 2012, Progress Energy Florida had
$1,637 million of net investment in Crystal River Unit 3 recorded in Regulatory
assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Progress Energy Florida recorded
$192 million of impairment and other charges related to the wholesale portion
of Crystal River Unit 3 investments, which are not covered by the 2012 FSPC
Settlement Agreement, and other provisions. The significant majority of this
amount is recorded in Impairment charges on Progress Energy Florida s and
Progress Energy s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income for the year ended December 31, 2012. This amount is reflected as part
of the purchase price allocation of the merger with Progress Energy in Duke
Energy s Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  In
accordance with the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, NEIL proceeds received allocable
to retail customers will be applied first to replacement power costs incurred
after December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2016, with the remainder used to
write down the remaining Crystal River Unit 3 investments.   

  Progress
Energy Florida believes the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, the
actions taken and costs incurred in response to the Crystal River Unit 3
delamination have been prudent and, accordingly, considers replacement power
and capital costs not recoverable through insurance to be recoverable through
its fuel cost-recovery clause or base rates. Additional replacement power costs
and exit cost to wind down the operations at the plant and decommission Crystal
River Unit 3 could be material. Retirement of the plant could impact funding
obligations associated with Progress Energy Florida s nuclear decommissioning
trust fund.  

  Progress Energy
Florida is a party to a master participation agreement and other related
agreements with the joint owners of Crystal River Unit 3 which convey certain
rights and obligations on Progress Energy Florida and the joint owners. In
December 2012, Progress Energy Florida reached an agreement with one group of
joint owners related to all Crystal River Unit 3 matters.   

  Progress Energy
Florida cannot predict the outcome of matters described above.

PART I   

Hydroelectric
Generating Facilities.   
All but one of USFE G s hydroelectric generating facilities are licensed by
the FERC under Part I of the Federal Power Act. The FERC has jurisdiction to
issue new hydroelectric operating licenses when the existing license expires.
The 13 hydroelectric stations of the Catawba-Wateree Project are in the late
stages of the FERC relicensing process. These stations continue to operate
under annual extensions of the current FERC license, which expired in 2008,
until the FERC issues a new license, which is currently projected to be issued by
mid-2013. Relicensing is now under way for two hydroelectric stations
comprising the Keowee-Toxaway Project. The current Keowee-Toxaway Project
license does not expire until 2016 and the project will continue to operate
under the current license until the new license is issued. The Bad Creek
Project license will expire in 2028, the Gaston Shoals Project and Ninety Nine
Islands Project licenses will expire in 2036 and the Queens Creek Project which
will expire in 2023. All other hydroelectric stations are operating under
current operating licenses, including ten hydroelectric stations in the East
Fork, West Fork, Nantahala, Bryson, Mission, Franklin projects, and the
Markland Project (in Indiana) for which new licenses were issued in 2010
through 2012. Duke Energy requested and the FERC approved a license surrender
for the Dillsboro project. Duke Energy Carolinas has removed the Dillsboro
Project dam and powerhouse as part of multi-project and multi-stakeholder
agreements and Duke Energy Carolinas is continuing with stream restoration and
post-removal monitoring as requested by FERC s license surrender order.   

  Progress Energy
Carolinas has three hydroelectric generating plants licensed by the FERC:
Walters, Tillery and Blewett. Progress Energy Carolinas also owns the Marshall
Plant, which has a license exemption. The total summer generating capacity for
all four units is 225 MW. Progress Energy Carolinas submitted an application to
relicense its Tillery and Blewett plants for 50 years and anticipates a
decision by the FERC in 2013. The Walters Plant license will expire in 2034.

COMMERCIAL POWER   

Commercial Power owns,
operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and
procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these
plants as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Power s generation
operations, excluding renewable energy generation assets, consist primarily of
coal-fired and gas-fired nonregulated generation assets which are dispatched
into wholesale markets. These assets are comprised of 6,825 net MW of power
generation primarily located in the Midwestern U.S. The asset portfolio has a
diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as
combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units. The coal-fired generation
assets were dedicated under the Duke Energy Ohio Electric Security Plan (ESP)
through December 31, 2011. As discussed in the USFE G section above, the
new ESP effectively separates the generation of electricity from Duke Energy
Ohio s retail load obligation as of January 1, 2012. As a result, As a result,
the energy from Duke Energy Ohio s coal-fired generation assets no longer serve
retail load customers or receive negotiated pricing under the ESP. Effective
January 1, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio completed its Regional Transmission
Organization (RTO) realignment to PJM and operates as a Fixed Resource
Requirement (FRR) entity through May 31, 2015. As an FRR entity, Duke Energy
Ohio is obligated to self supply capacity for the Duke Energy Ohio load zone. The
generation assets began selling all of their electricity into wholesale markets
in January 2012 and currently receive wholesale energy margins and capacity
revenues from PJM at market rates. Commercial Power has economically hedged its
forecasted coal-fired generation and a significant portion of its forecasted
gas-fired generation for 2013. Capacity revenues are 100% contracted in PJM
through May 2016.   

  For information on
Commercial Power s generation facilities, see  Commercial Power  in Item 2,
 Properties    

  Commercial Power also
has a retail sales subsidiary, Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC (Duke Energy
Retail), which is certified by the PUCO as a Competitive Retail Electric
Supplier (CRES) provider in Ohio. Duke Energy Retail serves retail electric and
gas customers in southwest, west central and northern Ohio with energy and other
energy services at competitive rates.   

  Through Duke Energy
Generation Services, Inc. (DEGS), Commercial Power engages in the development,
construction and operation of renewable energy projects. In addition, DEGS
develops commercial transmission projects. Currently, DEGS has approximately 1,269
net MW of renewable generating capacity in operation as of December 31, 2012.  

Rates
and Regulation   

Duke Energy Ohio
Capacity Rider Filing.    On August 29, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application
with the PUCO for the establishment of a charge, pursuant to Ohio s state
compensation mechanism, for capacity provided consistent with its obligations
as an FRR entity. The application included a request for deferral authority and
for a new tariff to implement the charge. The deferral being sought is the
difference between its costs and market-based prices for capacity. The
requested tariff would implement a charge to be collected via a rider through
which such deferred balances will subsequently be recovered. 24 parties moved
to intervene. Hearings have been set for April 2, 2013. Duke Energy Ohio
expects an order in 2013.  

   Other Matters.    As discussed in the
USFE G section above, the PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohio s new ESP in
November 2011. In November 2011, as a result of changes resulting from the
PUCO s approval of the new ESP, Commercial Power ceased applying regulatory
accounting treatment to its Ohio operations. Currently, no portion of
Commercial Power applies regulatory accounting.   

  Commercial Power s
Ohio retail load operations  rates were subject to approval by the PUCO through
December 2011, and thus these operations, through December 31, 2011, are
referred to herein as Commercial Power s regulated operations.   

  For more information
on rate matters, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Regulatory Matters   Rate Related Information.    

  Commercial Power is
subject to regulation at the federal level, primarily from the FERC.
Regulations of the FERC govern access to regulated electric customer and other
data by nonregulated entities, and services provided between regulated and
non-regulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of
Commercial Power.   

  Commercial Power is

Market
Environment and Competition   

18   

PART I   

Commercial
Power competes for wholesale contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity, coal, natural gas and emission allowances. The market price of
commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services
provided, drive competition in the energy marketing business. Commercial
Power s main competitors include other nonregulated generators in the
Midwestern U.S., wholesale power providers, coal and natural gas suppliers, and
renewable energy.   

Fuel
Supply   

Commercial Power
relies on coal and natural gas for its generation of electric energy.   

   Coal.    Commercial Power meets
its coal demand through a portfolio of purchase supply contracts and spot
agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under supply contracts with
mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Commercial Power
uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by supply
contracts. Expiration dates for its supply contracts, which have various price
adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range through 2018. Commercial
Power expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with
other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing
contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets
change. The majority of Commercial Power s coal is sourced from mines in the
Northern Appalachian and Illinois basins. Commercial Power has an adequate
supply of coal to fuel its projected 2013 operations. The majority of
Commercial Power s coal-fired generation is equipped with flue gas
desulfurization equipment. As a result, Commercial Power is able to satisfy the
current emission limitations for SO 2  for existing facilities.   

   Gas.    Commercial Power is
responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to its
gas turbine generators. In general Commercial Power hedges its natural gas
requirements using financial contracts. Physical gas is purchased in the spot
market to meet generation needs.   

INTERNATIONAL ENERGY   

International Energy
principally operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in
sales and marketing of electric power, natural gas, and natural gas liquids
outside the U.S. It conducts operations through DEI and its affiliates and its
activities principally target power generation in Latin America. Additionally,
International Energy owns a 25% interest in National Methanol Company (NMC), a
large regional producer of methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)
located in Saudi Arabia. The investment in NMC is accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. In the first quarter of 2012, Duke Energy
completed   the sale of International Energy s indirect
25% ownership interest in Attiki Gas Supply, S.A (Attiki), a Greek corporation,
to an existing equity owner in a series of transactions that resulted in the
full discharge of the related debt obligation.   See Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates 
for additional information. In 2012, International Energy acquired a 240 MW
thermal plant in southern Chile.  In addition, International acquired Iberoamericana
de Energ a Ibener S.A., which owns and operates a 140 MW hydro complex. See
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Acquisitions and Dispositions
of Businesses and Sales of Other Assets,  for additional information.  

  International Energy s
customers include retail distributors, electric utilities, independent power
producers, marketers and industrial/commercial companies. International
Energy s current strategy is focused on optimizing the value of its current
Latin American portfolio and expanding the portfolio through investment in
generation opportunities in Latin America.   

  International Energy
owns, operates or has substantial interests in approximately 4,900 gross MW of
generation facilities. For information on International Energy s generation
facilities, see  International Energy  in Item 2,  Properties.    

Competition
and Regulation    

International Energy s
sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas competes directly with
other generators and marketers serving its market areas. Competitors are
country and region-specific but include government-owned electric generating
companies, local distribution companies with self-generation capability and
other privately owned electric generating and marketing companies. The
principal elements of competition are price and availability, terms of service,
flexibility and reliability of service.   

  A high percentage of
International Energy s portfolio consists of baseload hydroelectric generation
facilities which compete with other forms of electric generation available to
International Energy s customers and end-users, including natural gas and fuel
oils. Economic activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations,
weather, additional generation capacities and other factors affect the supply
and demand for electricity in the regions served by International Energy.  

  Recent legislation in
Brazil allowed the renewal of certain concessions that were granted prior to
1995 and due to expire in 2015 to 2017, if, among other things, the concession
holders dedicated their generation capacity to the regulated market.
International Energy s concessions, which were granted after 1995, were not
affected by this legislation. The change in market prices, if any, from this
legislation is not expected to have a significant impact on International
Energy s earnings and cash flows because its generation capacity is highly
contracted through 2016.  

  International Energy s
operations are subject to both country-specific and international laws and
regulations. (See  Environmental Matters  in this section.)   

OTHER   

The remainder of Duke
Energy s operations is presented as Other. While it is not an operating
segment, Other primarily includes unallocated corporate interest expense,
certain unallocated corporate costs, Bison Insurance Company Limited (Bison),

Duke Energy Foundation, Duke Energy s effective 50% interest in DukeNet
Communications, LLC (DukeNet) and related telecom businesses, and Duke Energy s
effective 60% interest in Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC (DETM), which
management is currently in the process of winding down.   

  Bison s principal
activities as a captive insurance entity include the indemnification of various
business risks and losses, such as property, business interruption, workers 
compensation and general liability of subsidiaries and affiliates of Duke
Energy. DukeNet develops, owns and operates a fiber optic communications
network, primarily in the southeast U.S., serving wireless, local and long-distance
communications companies, Internet service providers and other businesses and
organizations.

   Duke Energy Ohio
Business Segments.   
At December 31, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio operated two business segments, both of
which are considered reportable segments under the applicable accounting rules:
Franchised Electric and Gas and Commercial Power. For additional
information on each of these business segments, including financial
information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Business
Segments.    

  The following is a
brief description of the nature of operations of each of Duke Energy Ohio s
reportable business segments, as well as Other.  

Franchised
Electric and Gas   

Franchised Electric
and Gas consists of Duke Energy Ohio s regulated electric and gas transmission
and distribution systems located in Ohio and Kentucky, including its regulated
electric generation in Kentucky. Franchised Electric and Gas plans, constructs,
operates and maintains Duke Energy Ohio s transmission and distribution
systems, which transmit and distribute electric energy to consumers in
southwestern Ohio. In addition, Franchised Electric and Gas plans, constructs,
operates and maintains Duke Energy Kentucky s generation assets and
transmission and distribution systems, which generate, transmit and distribute
electric energy to consumers in and northern Kentucky. Franchised Electric and
Gas also transports and sells natural gas in southwestern Ohio and northern
Kentucky. Substantially all of Franchised Electric and Gas  operations are
regulated and, accordingly, these operations qualify for regulatory accounting
treatment.   

  Duke Energy Ohio s
Franchised Electric and Gas service area covers 3,000 square miles and supplies
electric service to 830,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers
and provides regulated transmission and distribution services for natural gas
to 500,000 customers. See Item 2.  Properties  for further discussion of Duke
Energy Ohio s Franchised Electric and Gas generating facilities.   

Commercial
Power   

Commercial Power owns,
operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and
procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these
plants, as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Power s generation
operations consists primarily of coal-fired generation assets located in Ohio and
gas-fired nonregulated generation assets which are dispatched into wholesale
markets and receive capacity revenues at market rates. These assets are
comprised of 6,825 net MW of power generation primarily located in the
Midwestern U.S. The asset portfolio has a diversified fuel mix with baseload
and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as combined cycle and peaking natural
gas-fired units. The coal-fired generation assets were dedicated under the Duke
Energy Ohio ESP through December 31, 2011. Duke Energy Ohio s Commercial Power
reportable operating segment does not include the operations of DEGS or Duke
Energy Retail, which is included in the Commercial Power reportable operating
segment at Duke Energy. See Item 2.  Properties , for further discussion of
Duke Energy Ohio s Commercial Power generating facilities.   

  The PUCO approved Duke
Energy Ohio s new ESP in November 2011. The ESP includes competitive auctions
for electricity supply for a term of January 1, 2012 through May 31, 2015. The
ESP also includes a provision for a non-bypassable stability charge of $110
million per year to be collected from 2012-2014 and requires Duke Energy Ohio
to transfer its generation assets to a nonregulated affiliate on or before
December 31, 2014. As a result of the new ESP, the energy from Duke Energy
Ohio s coal-fired generation assets no longer serve retail load customers or
receive negotiated pricing under the ESP.  

  Effective January 1,
2012, Duke Energy Ohio completed its RTO realignment to PJM, and operates as an
FRR entity through May 31, 2015. As an FRR entity, Duke Energy Ohio is required
to self supply capacity for the Duke Energy Ohio load zone.  

  See Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for further discussion
related to regulatory filings.   

  In 2012, 2011, and 2010
Duke Energy Ohio earned approximately 36%, 24%, and 13%, respectively, of its
consolidated operating revenues from PJM. These revenues relate to the sale of
capacity and electricity from all of Duke Energy Ohio s nonregulated generation
assets in 2012 and its gas-fired nonregulated generation assets in 2011 and
2010.

23   

PART I   

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS   

Unless
otherwise indicated, the risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks
associated with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the
Subsidiary Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants  franchised electric revenues, earnings and results are dependent
on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation,
transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their
ability to recover costs.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants  franchised electric businesses are regulated on a
cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to the statutes and regulatory
commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,
Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants  franchised electric
earnings exceed the returns established by the state regulatory commissions,
retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the
commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants  future earnings.
Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in
providing service on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants  future
earnings could be negatively impacted.   

  If
legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the
Duke Energy Registrants  exclusive rights to serve their franchised customers
were eroded, their future earnings could be negatively impacted.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants  plans for future expansion and modernization of their generation
fleet subject them to risk of failure to adequately execute and manage their
significant construction plans, as well as the risk of not recovering all costs
or of recovering costs in an untimely manner, which could materially impact
their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.    

  The
completion of the Duke Energy Registrants  anticipated capital investment projects
in existing and new generation facilities is subject to many construction and
development risks, including, but not limited to, risks related to financing,
obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and
schedules, and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards.
Moreover, the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to recover all these costs and
recovering costs in a timely manner could materially impact the Duke Energy
Registrants  consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.   

   Deregulation or
restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and
unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows and their utility
businesses.    

  Increased
competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring efforts, including
from the Energy Policy Act of 2005, could have a significant adverse financial
impact on the Duke Energy Registrants and consequently on their results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows. Increased competition could also
result in increased pressure to lower costs, including the cost of electricity.
Retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy and gas service could
have a significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants due
to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or
increased costs of capital. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the
extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets.
The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict when they will be subject to changes
in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes
on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   

   The ability of the
Duke Energy Registrants to recover significant costs resulting from severe
weather events is subject to regulatory oversight, and the timing and amount of
any such recovery is uncertain and may impact their financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.   

  The Duke
Energy Registrants are subject to incurring significant costs resulting from
damage sustained during severe weather events. If the Duke Energy Registrants
cannot recover costs associated with future severe weather events in a timely
manner, or in an amount sufficient to cover our actual costs, their financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and
adversely impacted.  

   Energy conservation
could negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants  financial results.    

  Certain
regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering
requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates.
Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new
levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements
in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy
consumption. To the extent conservation results in reduced energy demand or
significantly slows the growth in demand, the Duke Energy Registrants 
unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted. In the Duke Energy
Registrants  regulated operations, conservation could have a negative impact
depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts. The Duke
Energy Registrants currently have energy-efficiency riders in place to recover
the cost of energy-efficiency programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,
Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in
conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation,
regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a
negative financial impact.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants  businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation that will
affect their operations and costs.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants are subject to regulation by FERC, the NRC and various other
federal agencies. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy
Registrants  businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take
fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates of
transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt
securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and
the ability of the operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Duke Energy
Registrants. Changes to these regulations are ongoing, and the Duke Energy
Registrants cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory
environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment
will have on their businesses. However, changes in regulation (including
re-regulating previously deregulated markets) can cause delays in or affect
business planning and transactions and can substantially increase the Duke
Energy Registrants  costs.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that
require significant capital expenditures that can increase cost of operations,
and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to
environmental liabilities.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations
affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including air
emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous
waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating,
and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy
Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses,
permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws
and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures
for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties, and failure
to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines,
penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The steps the
Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure that their
facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the
Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of
their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses.
Further, the Duke Energy Registrants  regulatory rate structure and their
contracts with customers may not necessarily allow for the recovery of capital
costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations. Also, the Duke
Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all      

24   

PART I   

required environmental regulatory approvals for their
operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required
environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes
in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result
in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new
facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Although it
is not expected that the costs of complying with current environmental
regulations will have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no assurance can be
made that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future
will not have such an effect.   

  The EPA
has proposed new federal regulations governing the management of coal
combustion by-products, including fly ash. These regulations may require the Duke
Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase
operating and maintenance costs.   

  Other
potential new environmental regulations, limiting the use of coal acquired from
mountaintop removal and imposing additional requirements on water discharges
associated with mountaintop removal, could increase costs of fuel and require the
Duke Energy Registrants to make additional related capital expenditures. In
addition, the Duke Energy Registrants are generally responsible for on-site
liabilities, and in some cases off-site liabilities, associated with the
environmental condition of their power generation facilities and natural gas
assets acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and
whether they are known or unknown. In connection with some acquisitions and
sales of assets, the Duke Energy Registrants may obtain, or be required to
provide, indemnification against some environmental liabilities. If the Duke
Energy Registrants incur a material liability, or the other party to a
transaction fails to meet its indemnification obligations, the Duke Energy
Registrants could suffer material losses.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants  sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable
and affordable access to transmission assets.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and
operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to
the wholesale market. FERC s power transmission regulations, as well as those
of Duke Energy s international markets, require wholesale electric transmission
services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If
transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke
Energy Registrants  ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered.   

  The
different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which
could affect the Duke Energy Registrants  growth and performance in these
regions. In addition, the independent system operators who oversee the
transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and
may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address
volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other
mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy
Registrants  wholesale power marketing business.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance that
they and their rated subsidiaries will maintain investment grade credit
ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants or their rated subsidiaries are unable
to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under
credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or
cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity.    

  Each of
the Duke Energy Registrants and their rated subsidiaries  senior unsecured
long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies.
The Duke Energy Registrants cannot be sure that their senior unsecured
long-term debt or that of their rated subsidiaries will be rated investment
grade in the future.   

  If the
rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants or their rated
subsidiaries below investment grade, the entities  borrowing costs would
increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, their potential pool of investors
and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the Duke Energy
Registrants  short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper
market could be significantly limited. Any downgrade or other event negatively
affecting the credit ratings of the Duke Energy Registrants  subsidiaries could
make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited,
which in turn could increase their need to provide liquidity in the form of
capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries, thus reducing the
liquidity and borrowing availability of the consolidated group. A reduction in
liquidity and borrowing availability could ultimately impact the ability to
indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its international operations, which could
result in significant income taxes that would have a material adverse effect on
Duke Energy s results of operations.  

  A
downgrade below investment grade could also require the Duke Energy Registrants
to post additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under
various credit agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate
derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events
would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants  liquidity and profitability
and could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants are exposed to credit risk of the customers and counterparties with
whom they do business.    

  Adverse
economic conditions affecting, or financial difficulties of, customers and
counterparties with whom the Duke Energy Registrants do business could impair
the ability of these customers and counterparties to pay for services or
fulfill their contractual obligations, including loss recovery payments under
insurance contracts, or cause them to delay such payments or obligations. The
Duke Energy Registrants depend on these customers and counterparties to remit
payments on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could adversely
affect the Duke Energy Registrants  cash flows, financial position or results
of operations.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants  operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis
and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe
weather.   

  Electric
power generation is generally a seasonal business. In most parts of the U.S.,
and other markets in which Duke Energy operates, demand for power peaks during
the warmer summer months, with market prices typically peaking at that time. In
other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Further, extreme weather
conditions such as heat waves or winter storms could cause these seasonal
fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, in the future, the overall
operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses may fluctuate
substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period
comparison less relevant.   

  Sustained
severe drought conditions could impact generation by the Duke Energy
Registrants  hydroelectric plants, as well as their fossil and nuclear plant
operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation
of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by
severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms,
snow and ice storms, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages;
property damage, including downed transmission and distribution lines; and
additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage.  

   The Duke Energy
Registrants are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which
are uncertain. Adverse resolution of these matters could negatively affect the
Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, including claims
for damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen prior to 1985 from the
exposure to or use of asbestos at electric generation plants of Duke Energy
Carolinas. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the Duke Energy
Registrants cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. It
is reasonably possible that the final resolution of      

25   

PART I   

some
of the matters could require additional expenditures, in excess of established
reserves, over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could
have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  cash flows and results
of operations. Similarly, it is reasonably possible that the terms of
resolution could require the Duke Energy Registrants to change business
practices and procedures, which could also have a material effect on their financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.   

   The Duke Energy
Registrants  results of operations may be negatively affected by overall
market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.    

  Sustained
downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which
the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence energy operations.
Declines in demand for energy as a result of economic downturns in the Duke
Energy Registrants  franchised electric service territories will reduce overall
sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce
production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and gas. Although the
Duke Energy Registrants  franchised electric and gas business is subject to
regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel
under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a
result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows,
thus diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic
downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants  results of
operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges
being recorded to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including
goodwill, to their respective fair values.   

  The Duke
Energy Registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other
competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such
transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return
on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results
of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market
prices. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short
periods of time and could reduce the Duke Energy Registrants  revenues and
margins and thereby diminish their results of operations.   

  Factors
that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at
which the Duke Energy Registrants  able to sell electricity are as follows:   

weather
conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower
energy usage for heating or cooling purposes, respectively, and periods of low
rainfall that decrease the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to operate its
facilities in an economical manner;  

supply
of and demand for energy commodities;   

transmission
or transportation constraints or inefficiencies which impact the Duke Energy
Registrants  non-regulated energy operations;   

availability
of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some
customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or gas plants, and of
energy-efficient equipment which reduces energy demand;   

natural
gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;   

ability
to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, such as coal, gas and uranium;   

electric
generation capacity surpluses which cause the Duke Energy Registrants 
non-regulated energy plants to generate and sell less electricity at lower
prices and may cause some plants to become non-economical to operate; and   

capacity
and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants  markets.

Coal
inventory levels have increased due to mild weather, low natural gas and power
prices resulting in higher combined cycle gas-fired generation, and the
economy s overall effect on load. Continuation of these factors for an extended
period of time could result in additional costs of managing the coal inventory
or other costs. If these costs are not recoverable the Duke Energy Registrants 
results of operations could be negatively impacted.   

   Fluctuations in
commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the
Duke Energy Registrants  operations as well as their financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.   

  The Duke
Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the
price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other
energy-related commodities, including emission allowances, as a result of their
ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through
cost-recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions.
Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants have hedging strategies in place to
mitigate fluctuations in commodity supply prices, but to the extent that these
do not cover the entire exposure to commodity price fluctuations, or their
hedging procedures do not work as planned, there can be no assurances that the
Duke Energy Registrants  financial performance will not be negatively impacted
by price fluctuations. Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to
risk that counterparties will not be able to perform their obligations. Should counterparties
fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the
underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses
in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.  

  Certain of the Duke
Energy Registrants hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting
of, derivative collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily
derivative position. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return
of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties
negatively impact our liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants 
credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The
Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to
market price activity.  

   Poor investment
performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors
impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy
Registrants  liquidity and results of operations.    

  The
costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent
upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount
rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding
levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary
contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants participate in
employee benefit plans sponsored by Duke Energy or Progress Energy. The
Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and
obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension
investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and depending upon
the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be
required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding
obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants  proportionate share of such cash
funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy
Registrants  financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   

   Potential terrorist
activities or military or other actions, including cyber system attacks, could
adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses.    

  The
continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other
action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and
financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil
which may have material adverse affects in ways the Duke Energy      

26   

PART I   

Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition,
future acts of terrorism and any possible reprisals as a consequence of action
by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the
U.S. or their international affiliates. Cyber systems, infrastructure and
generation facilities such as the Duke Energy Registrants  nuclear plants could
be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by
individuals or groups. The potential for terrorism has subjected the Duke Energy
Registrants  operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse
effect on their businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may
experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased
security for their cyber systems and plants, including nuclear power plants
under the NRC s design basis threat requirements, such as additional physical
plant security, additional security personnel or additional capability
following a terrorist incident.   

  The
insurance industry has also been disrupted by these potential events. As a
result, the availability of insurance covering risks the Duke Energy
Registrants and their competitors typically insure against may decrease. In
addition, the insurance the Duke Energy Registrants are able to obtain may have
higher deductibles, higher premiums, lower coverage limits and more restrictive
policy terms.   

  Information
security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the
proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and
activities of cyber attacks. Through our smart grid and other initiatives, the
Duke Energy Registrants have increasingly connected equipment and systems
related to the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the
Internet. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure and the
increased accessibility enabled through connection to the Internet, the Duke
Energy Registrants may face a heightened risk of cyber attack. In the event of
such an attack, the Duke Energy Registrants could have business operations
disrupted, property damaged and customer information stolen; experience
substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be
subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to our reputation.  

  Additional
risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Duke Energy Registrants or
which they currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect
the Duke Energy Registrants  financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.   

   Failure to attract and
retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke
Energy Registrants  results of operations.    

  Certain
events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to
future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating
challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss
of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this
case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity
costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train
replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal
historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability
and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and
operate the business. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully
attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial
position or results of operations could be negatively affected.   

   The Duke Energy Registrants
rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term capital markets to
finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to
those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of
which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants  control.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants  businesses are financed to a large degree through debt and
the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often
does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of
liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations
and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate
maturities, Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants rely on access to
short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets and the
Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany
borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access capital at
competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and
implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely
affected. An inability to access capital may limit the Duke Energy Registrants 
ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on
for future growth.   

  Market
disruptions may increase the Duke Energy Registrants  cost of borrowing or
adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets. Such
disruptions could include: economic downturns; the bankruptcy of an unrelated
energy company; capital market conditions generally; market prices for
electricity and gas; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on their
facilities or unrelated energy companies; or the overall health of the energy
industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energy s revolving credit
facilities depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under
such facilities to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise.
Systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a
bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement.   

  Duke
Energy maintains revolving credit facilities to provide back-up for a
commercial paper program for variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be
put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder and
certain letters of credit at various entities. These facilities typically
include borrowing sublimits for the Subsidiary Registrants and financial
covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage
of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these
covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing
commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit
or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. Additionally, failure to
comply with these financial covenants could result in Duke Energy being
required to immediately pay down any outstanding amounts under other revolving
credit agreements.   

   Duke Energy s
investments and projects located outside of the United States expose it to
risks related to laws of other countries, taxes, economic conditions, political
conditions and policies of foreign governments. These risks may delay or reduce
Duke Energy s realization of value from its international projects.    

  Duke
Energy currently owns and may acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related
investments and projects outside the U.S. The economic, regulatory, market and
political conditions in some of the countries where Duke Energy has interests
or in which it may explore development, acquisition or investment opportunities
could present risks related to, among others, Duke Energy s ability to obtain
financing on suitable terms, its customers  ability to honor their obligations
with respect to projects and investments, delays in construction, limitations
on its ability to enforce legal rights, and interruption of business, as well as
risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or
nullification of existing contracts and changes in law, regulations, market
rules or tax policy.   

   Duke Energy s
investments and projects located outside of the United States expose it to
risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. These risks, and Duke Energy s
activities to mitigate such risks, may adversely affect its cash flows and
results of operations.    

  Duke
Energy s operations and investments outside the U.S. expose it to risks related
to fluctuations in currency rates. As each local currency s value changes
relative to the U.S. dollar   Duke Energy s principal reporting currency   the
value in U.S. dollars of Duke Energy s assets and liabilities in such locality and
the cash flows generated in such locality, expressed in U.S. dollars, also
change. Duke Energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the
Brazilian Real.   

  Duke
Energy selectively mitigates some risks associated with foreign currency
fluctuations by, among other things, indexing contracts to the U.S. dollar
and/or local inflation rates, hedging through debt denominated or issued in the
foreign currency and hedging through foreign currency derivatives. These
efforts, however, may not be effective and, in some cases, may expose Duke
Energy to other risks that could negatively affect its cash flows and results
of operations.   

27   

PART I   

Duke
Energy s merger with Progress Energy may not achieve its intended results.    

  The
merger is expected to result in various benefits, including, among other
things, cost savings and operating efficiencies relating to the joint dispatch
of generation and combining of fuel purchasing power. Achieving the anticipated
benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including
market conditions, risks related to Duke Energy s businesses, and whether the
business of Progress Energy is integrated in an efficient and effective manner.
Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs;
decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company
and diversion of management s time and energy and could have an adverse effect
on the combined company s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.   

   Duke Energy s and
Progress Energy s ability to fully utilize tax credits may be limited.   

  In
accordance with the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 29/45K, Duke
Energy and Progress Energy have generated tax credits based on the content and
quantity of coal-based solid synthetic fuels produced and sold to unrelated
parties. This tax credit program expired at the end of 2007. The timing of the
utilization of the tax credits is dependent upon Duke Energy s and Progress
Energy s taxable income. The timing of the utilization can also be impacted by
certain substantial changes in ownership, including the merger of Duke Energy
and Progress Energy. Additionally, in the normal course of business, Duke
Energy s and Progress Energy s tax returns are audited by the IRS. If Duke
Energy s and Progress Energy s tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part
as a result of an IRS audit, there could be significant additional tax
liabilities and associated interest for previously recognized tax credits,
which could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy s and Progress
Energy s earnings and cash flows. Although Duke Energy and Progress Energy are
unaware of any currently proposed legislation or new IRS regulations or
interpretations impacting previously recorded synthetic fuels tax credits, the
value of credits generated could be unfavorably impacted by such legislation or
 IRS regulations and interpretations.  

   Duke Energy Carolinas,
Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida may incur substantial
costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear
generating facilities.    

  Ownership
interest in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas,
Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida subject them to various
risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects
on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear
facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;
limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to
cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and
uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of
decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.   

  Ownership
and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with
licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of
non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, and/or
shut down a unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the
situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC,
which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or outside of
Duke Energy Carolinas , Progress Energy Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s
control, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a
third-party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as
well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious
nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on Duke
Energy Carolinas , Progress Energy Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s
results of operations and financial condition.   

  Ownership
and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of
funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the
respective nuclear power plants. As discussed below, poor investment
performance of these decommissioning trusts  holdings and other factors
impacting decommissioning costs could unfavorably impact Duke Energy
Carolinas , Progress Energy Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s liquidity
and results of operations as they could be required to significantly increase
their cash contributions to the decommissioning trusts.   

   Market performance and
other changes may decrease the value of Duke Energy Carolinas , Progress Energy
Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund
(NDTF) investments, which then could require significant additional funding.   

  The
performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in
trust to satisfy future obligations to decommission nuclear plants. Duke Energy
Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida have
significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these
trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield
uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a
number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of
the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for
decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy
Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage the
NDTF assets, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be negatively affected.  

   The costs of retiring
Progress Energy Florida s Crystal River Unit 3 could prove to be more extensive
than is currently identified. All costs associated with retirement of the
Crystal River Unit 3 asset, including replacement power, may not be fully recoverable
through the regulatory process.   

  Early
retirement could result in continued purchases of replacement power and/or
additional capital and operating costs associated with construction of
replacement capacity resources to continue to service Progress Energy Florida s
customer needs. However, there is no definitive plan for new generating
capacity at this time. In
addition, exit costs to wind down operations and ultimately to retire and
decommission the plant could exceed estimates and, if not recoverable through
the regulatory process, could adversely affect Duke Energy s, Progress Energy s
and Progress Energy Florida s financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.  

  While
the foregoing reflects Progress Energy Florida s current intentions and
estimates with respect to the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3, the cost of
replacement power, and the degree of recoverability of these costs, are all
subject to significant uncertainties. Additional developments with respect to
Crystal River Unit 3, costs that are greater than anticipated and
recoverability that is less than anticipated could adversely affect Duke
Energy s, Progress Energy s and Progress Energy Florida s financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.   

   Duke Energy Ohio s and
Duke Energy Indiana s membership in a RTO presents risks that could have a
material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.    

  The
price at which Duke Energy Ohio can sell its generation capacity and energy is
dependent on a number of factors, which include the overall supply and demand
of generation and load, other state legislation or regulation, transmission
congestion, and its business rules. As a result, the prices in day ahead and
real time energy markets and RTO capacity markets are subject to price
volatility. Administrative costs imposed by RTOs, including the cost of
administering energy markets, are also subject to volatility. PJM
Interconnection, LLC (PJM) conducts Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) base
residual auctions for capacity on an annual planning year basis. The results of
the PJM RPM base residual auction are impacted by the supply and demand of
generation and load and also may be impacted by congestion and PJM rules
relating to bidding for Demand Response and Energy Efficiency resources.
Auction prices could fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of
time. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of future auctions, but if
the auction prices are sustained at low levels, its results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.   

28   

PART I   

The
rules governing the various regional power markets may also change, which could
affect Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s costs and/or revenues. To
the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant
additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of
operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be
allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due
to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy
Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to
decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. While
RTO transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral, various
proposals and proceedings currently taking place by the FERC may cause transmission
rates to change from time to time. In addition, RTOs has been developing rules
associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated
with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and
firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on Duke Energy Ohio
and Duke Energy Indiana. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may also
incur fees and costs to participate in RTOs.   

  As a
members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to
certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among
RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in
the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO
that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members, including
Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana.

    Brazilian
Regulatory Citations.         In September 2007, the State Environmental Agency of
Parana (IAP) assessed seven fines against Duke Energy International Geracao
Paranapenema S.A. (DEIGP), totaling $15 million for failure to comply with
reforestation measures allegedly required by state regulations in Brazil. On January
14, 2010, DEIGP received a notice that one of the fines was subsequently
increased, on grounds that DEIGP is an alleged repeat offender; however, in
2012 the decision to increase the amount of that fine was reversed. DEIGP filed
administrative appeals with respect to all the fines. Between 2009 and 2012,
four of the fines, in the total amount of $9 million, were judged to be valid
in the administrative courts. DEIGP challenged those administrative rulings in
the Brazilian state courts, by filing judicial actions for annulment and also
requested that its payment obligations be enjoined pending resolution on the
merits. In one of the four cases, the court granted DEIGP s request for
injunction, and subsequently ruled on the merits in favor of DEIGP. The
plaintiff filed an appeal. In two of the four cases, the court granted DEIGP s
request for injunction, and a decision on the merit is pending. In the fourth
case, DEIGP s request for injunction was denied; however, DEIGP was granted
permission to deposit the total amount of the fine in the court registry and to
suspend entry of the debt in the state tax liability roster.   

  Additionally,
DEIGP was assessed three environmental fines by the Brazilian federal
environmental enforcement agency, Brazil Institute of Environment and Renewable
Natural Resources (IBAMA), totaling approximately $1 million for improper
maintenance of existing reforested areas. DEIGP believes that it has properly
maintained all reforested areas and has challenged these assessments.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW    

Merger with Progress
Energy   

On July 2, 2012, Duke
Energy completed the merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(Merger Agreement), among Diamond Acquisition Corporation, a North Carolina
corporation and Duke Energy s wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub) and Progress
Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy), a North Carolina corporation engaged in the
regulated utility business of generation, transmission and distribution and
sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.
As a result of the merger, Merger Sub was merged into Progress Energy and
Progress Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy.  

  The merger between
Duke Energy and Progress Energy provides increased scale and diversity with
potentially enhanced access to capital over the long term and a greater ability
to undertake the significant construction programs necessary to respond to
increasing environmental regulation, plant retirements and customer demand
growth. Duke Energy s business risk profile is expected to improve over time
due to the increased proportion of the business that is regulated.
Additionally, cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits are expected from
the combined operations.  

  Immediately preceding
the merger, Duke Energy completed a one-for-three reverse stock split with
respect to the issued and outstanding shares of Duke Energy common stock. The
shareholders of Duke Energy approved the reverse stock split at Duke Energy s special
meeting of shareholders held on August 23, 2011. All share and per share
amounts presented herein reflect the impact of the one-for-three reverse stock
split.  

  Progress Energy s
shareholders received 0.87083 shares of Duke Energy common stock in exchange
for each share of Progress Energy common stock outstanding as of July 2, 2012.
Generally, all outstanding Progress Energy equity-based compensation awards
were converted into Duke Energy equity-based compensation awards using the same
ratio. The merger was structured as a tax-free exchange of shares.  

  For additional
information on the details of this transaction including regulatory conditions
and accounting implications, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses and Sales of Other
Assets.   

2012 Financial Results

The following table
summarizes adjusted earnings and net income attributable to Duke Energy for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.   

37   

PART II   

Adjusted
earnings increased from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of Progress
Energy results beginning in July 2012, and the impact of the 2011 Duke Energy
Carolinas rate cases. Adjusted earnings increased from 2010 to 2011 primarily
due to earnings attributable to Duke Energy s ongoing modernization program and
increased results at International Energy net of less favorable weather and
higher operating expenses.   

  Net income for the
year ended December 31, 2012 includes pretax impairment and other charges of $628
million related to the Edwardsport integrated gasification combined cycle
(IGCC) project and costs to achieve the Progress Energy merger of $636 million.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes pretax impairment
charges of $222 million related to the Edwardsport IGCC project and $79 million
to write down the carrying value of excess emission allowances held by
Commercial Power to fair value. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2010
was impacted by goodwill and other impairment charges of $660 million,
primarily related to the nonregulated generation operations in the Midwest and
gains on the sale of assets of $248M related to the sale of Q-Comm and the sale
of a 50 percent interest in DukeNet.   

  See  Results of
Operations  below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of
operations, as well as a detailed discussion of financial results for each of
Duke Energy s reportable business segments, as well as Other.   

2012 Areas of Focus
and Accomplishments    

In 2012, Duke Energy
was focused on managing regulatory approvals related to the merger with
Progress Energy, completing its remaining major capital projects and obtaining
constructive regulatory outcomes.   

    Regulatory Approvals
Related to the Merger with Progress Energy.     In June 2012, the
FERC and NCUC conditionally approved Duke Energy s merger with Progress Energy.
On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy successfully closed the merger with Progress
Energy. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Acquisitions and
Dispositions of Businesses and Sales of Other Assets  for further discussion
related to the merger with Progress Energy.  

    Completion and Placing
in Service of Major Capital Projects    . In 2012, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas
(USFE G) made significant progress toward advancing its fleet modernization
program. Duke Energy Carolinas has invested approximately $3.5 billion through
2012 in three key generation fleet modernization projects with approximately 2,065
megawatts (MW) of capacity. In 2012, Duke Energy Carolinas placed its 620 MW
Dan River combined cycle natural gas-fired generation facility and its 825 MW
coal-fired Cliffside Unit 6 in service, completing its portion of the fleet
modernization program.  

   Progress Energy
Carolinas has invested approximately $1.7 billion through 2012 in three key
generation fleet modernization projects with approximately 2,140 megawatts (MW)
of capacity. In 2012, Progress Energy Carolinas placed in service the second of
these projects, the 920 MW Lee combined cycle natural gas-fired generation
facility, and continued to construct the 625 MW combined cycle natural
gas-fired generation Sutton facility, which is 64% complete at December 31,
2012. The Sutton project is scheduled to be placed in service in 2013.  

  Duke Energy Indiana has
invested approximately $3.4 billion through 2012 in its generation fleet modernization
project, the 618 MW Edwardsport IGCC plant, which is 99% complete at
December 31, 2012. In 2012, Duke Energy Indiana experienced cost pressures
and regulatory scrutiny related to the Edwardsport IGCC project. As a result,
Duke Energy Indiana recorded additional pre-tax impairment and other charges of
approximately $628 million. This project is scheduled to be placed in service
during 2013. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory
Matters  for further discussion of the Edwardsport IGCC project.   

  In
2012, Commercial Power completed five new wind farms and three solar farms,
totaling approximately 800 MW, of which 150 MW were contributed to a joint
venture with Sumitomo Corporation of America.  

    Obtaining Constructive Regulatory Outcomes.     In 2012, Duke Energy
successfully filed three rate cases in North Carolina and Ohio, including
Progress Energy Carolinas  first request for a base rate increase in 25 years.  

  In
the fourth quarter of 2012, Duke Energy reached a settlement agreement with the
NCUC, the North Carolina Public Staff and the North Carolina Department of
Justice (NCDOJ) regarding the NCUC s and NCDOJ s investigations into the
post-merger CEO change. The settlement agreements resolve all matters related
to the NCUC and NCDOJ investigations.  

  On
December 27, 2012, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a
settlement agreement finalized in April 2012, between Duke Energy Indiana, the
OUCC, the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel-Indiana, on the
cost increase for the construction of the project. The settlement agreement, as
approved, caps costs to be reflected in customer rates at $2.595 billion,
including estimated financing costs through June 30, 2012.   

2013 Objectives    

Duke Energy will focus
on obtaining constructive regulatory outcomes related to its pending and
planned rate cases, achieving intended savings and efficiencies from its merger
with Progress Energy, successfully managing the Crystal River Unit 3 retirement
and related regulatory proceedings, completing the remaining major capital
projects in its fleet modernization program and optimizing nuclear fleet
performance.   

    Obtaining Constructive
Regulatory Outcomes.     The significant majority of Duke Energy s future
earnings are anticipated to be contributed from USFE G, which consists of
Duke Energy s regulated businesses. Duke Energy has several ongoing rate cases
and other regulatory proceedings in North Carolina, Ohio and Indiana. Later in
2013, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas will file additional
rate cases in South Carolina. Duke Energy expects resolution of these cases in
2013 or early 2014. These planned rates cases are needed to recover investments
in Duke Energy s ongoing infrastructure modernization projects and operating
costs. Planning for and obtaining favorable outcomes from these regulatory
proceedings are key factors in achieving Duke Energy s long-term growth
assumptions.   

    Achieving Intended
Merger Cost Savings and Efficiencies.     Duke Energy is taking a disciplined and
systematic approach to merger integration work. Duke Energy is on track to
achieve intended savings and efficiencies. In addition, through the efficient
joint dispatch of the Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas
generation fleets, Duke Energy is ahead of schedule in achieving fuels savings for
customers in the Carolinas, achieving $52 million in fuel costs during the
first six months following the merger. These savings are passed to customers.  

    Management of Crystal
River Unit 3 Retirement.     On February 5, 2013, following the completion of a
comprehensive analysis, Duke Energy announced its intention to retire Crystal
River Unit 3. Duke Energy concluded that it did not have a high degree of
confidence that repair could be successfully completed and licensed within
estimated costs and schedule, and that was in the best interests of Progress
Energy Florida s customers and joint owners and Duke Energy s investors to
retire the unit. Progress Energy Florida developed initial estimates of the
cost to decommission the plant during its analysis of whether to repair or
retire Crystal River Unit 3. With the final decision to retire, Progress Energy
Florida is working to develop a comprehensive decommissioning plan, which will
evaluate various decommissioning options and costs associated with each option.
The plan will determine resource needs as well as the scope, schedule and other
elements of decommissioning. Progress Energy Florida intends to use a safe      

38   

PART II   

storage (SAFSTOR) option for decommissioning. Generally,
SAFSTOR involves placing the facility into a safe storage configuration,
requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions, until the eventual
dismantling and decontamination activities occur, usually in 40 to 60 years.
This decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number of retired
domestic nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted approaches
to decommissioning required by the NRC. Additional specifics about the
decommissioning plan are being developed. Also on February 5, 2013, Progress
Energy Florida announced it and NEIL had accepted the mediator s proposal
whereby NEIL will pay Progress Energy Florida an additional $530 million. Along
with the $305 million which NEIL previously paid, Progress Energy Florida will
receive a total of $835 million in insurance proceeds. Progress Energy Florida
expects that the FPSC will review the prudence of the retirement decision in
Phase 2 of the Crystal River Unit 3 delamination regulatory docket. Progress
Energy Florida has also asked the FPSC to review the mediated resolution of
insurance claims with NEIL as part of Phase 3 of this regulatory docket. Phase
2 and Phase 3 hearings have been tentatively scheduled to begin on June 19,
2013.  

    Completing Remaining
Major Capital Projects.     Duke Energy anticipates total capital expenditures of $5.9
billion to $6.3 billion in 2013. Approximately $1.7 billion of these expenditures
are related to expansion and growth projects, including but not limited to, the
Edwardsport IGCC plant and the Sutton combined cycle facility. Following the
completion of the Sutton and Edwardsport facilities in 2013, the major
components of Duke Energy s fleet modernization program will be complete. The
fleet modernization program will permit Duke Energy to retire up to 6,800 MW of
older, less-efficient coal-fired units by 2015, with approximately 3,800 MW
retired by the end of 2013.  

    Optimizing Nuclear
Fleet Performance.    
In 2012, Duke Energy s nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor over 90
percent, excluding Crystal River Unit 3. Duke Energy will continue to leverage
best practices across the nuclear fleet to maintain and improve the performance
of the fleet. To meet this goal, targeted investments to increase overall fleet
performance and to meet the NRC s Fukushima-related requirements totaling $825
million are planned over the next three years.   

Economic Factors for
Duke Energy s Business    

The historical and
future trends of Duke Energy s operating results have been and will be affected
in varying degrees by a number of factors, including those discussed below.
Duke Energy s revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather
conditions and behavior patterns, general business conditions and the cost of
energy services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric
service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Duke Energy s ability
to recover its costs from customers.   

  Declines in demand for
electricity as a result of economic downturns reduce overall electricity sales
and have the potential to lessen Duke Energy s cash flows, especially if retail
customers reduce consumption of electricity. A weakening economy could also
impact Duke Energy s customers  ability to pay, causing increased
delinquencies, slowing collections and leading to higher than normal levels of
accounts receivables, bad debts and financing requirements. A portion of
USFE G s business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of
return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses.   

  If negative market
conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of
Duke Energy s individual assets, including goodwill, do not exceed the carrying
value of those individual assets, asset impairments may occur in the future
under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations. A change in
management s intent about the use of individual assets (held for use versus
held for sale) could also result in impairments or losses. Duke Energy
evaluates the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an
annual basis as of August 31 and performs interim impairment tests if a
triggering event occurs that indicates it is not more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For further
information on key assumptions that impact Duke Energy s goodwill impairment
assessments, see  Critical Accounting Policy for Goodwill Impairment
Assessments  and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Goodwill,
Intangible Assets and Impairments.    

  Duke Energy s goals
for 2013 and beyond could also be substantially at risk due to the regulation
of its businesses. Duke Energy s businesses in the U.S. are subject to
regulation on the federal and state level. Regulations, applicable to the
electric power industry, have a significant impact on the nature of the
businesses and the manner in which they operate. USFE G has four outstanding
rate cases and plans to initiate two additional rate cases in 2013. New
legislation and changes to regulations are ongoing, including anticipated
carbon legislation, and Duke Energy cannot predict the future course of changes
in the regulatory or political environment or the ultimate effect that any such
future changes will have on its business.   

  Duke Energy s earnings
are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices. Exposure to commodity prices
generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses. To mitigate
these risks, Duke Energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively
hedge some, but not all, known exposures.   

  Additionally, Duke
Energy s investments and projects located outside of the U.S. expose Duke
Energy to risks related to laws of other countries, taxes, economic conditions,
fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign
governments. Changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact
Duke Energy s future results.   

  Duke Energy also
relies on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital
markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow
from operations. An inability to access capital at competitive rates or at all
could adversely affect Duke Energy s ability to implement its strategy.
Market disruptions or a downgrade of Duke Energy s credit rating may increase
its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more
sources of liquidity. For further information related to management s
assessment of Duke Energy s risk factors, see Item 1A,  Risk Factors.    

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

In this section, Duke
Energy provides analysis and discussion of earnings and factors affecting
earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.   

  Management evaluates
financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted
earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), which is measured as
income from continuing operations after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling
interests, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items and
the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment.
Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes
will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is reasonably possible
such charges and credits could recur. Mark-to-market adjustments reflect the
mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts, which is recognized in GAAP
earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge
accounting or regulatory accounting treatment, used in Duke Energy s hedging of
a portion of economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Power
segment. The economic value of the generation assets is subject to fluctuations
in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output
commodities (e.g., coal, power) and, as such, the economic hedging involves
both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to the
generation assets. Because the operations of the generation assets are
accounted for under the accrual method, management believes that excluding the
impact of mark-to-market changes of the economic hedge contracts from operating
earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the hedge
contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset.
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted
diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an
additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy s performance across periods.
Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for planning and forecasting
and for reporting results to the Board of Directors, employees, shareholders,
analysts and      

39   

PART II   

investors concerning Duke Energy s
financial performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for Adjusted earnings
and Adjusted diluted EPS is Net Income and Diluted EPS attributable to Duke
Energy common shareholders, which includes the dollar and per share impact of
special items, the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial
Power segment and discontinued operations.   

Overview   

The following table
reconciles Adjusted earnings to Net income attributable to Duke Energy and
Adjusted diluted EPS to Diluted EPS attributable to Duke Energy (amounts are
net of tax):   

The variance in
adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year
ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to:   

The
inclusion of Progress Energy results beginning in July 2012; and  

Increased
retail pricing and riders primarily resulting from the implementation of
revised rates in North Carolina and South Carolina.   

  Partially offset by   

Unfavorable
weather in 2012 compared to 2011;   

Higher
depreciation and amortization expense;  

Lower
nonregulated Midwest coal generation results; and    

Incremental
shares issued to complete the Progress Energy merger (impacts per share diluted
amounts only).   

  The variance in adjusted earnings for the
year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, was
primarily due to:   

Increased
earnings associated with major construction projects at USFE    

Effect
of 2010 Duke Energy Foundation funding;   

Increased
results in Brazil due to higher average contract prices;   

Increased
earnings from National Methanol Company (NMC);   

Lower
corporate governance costs;   

Increased
results in Peru due to additional capacity revenues and an arbitration award;
and   

Increased
results in Central America due to higher average prices and volumes.   

  Partially offset by   

Less
favorable weather in 2011 compared to 2010 at USFE    

Increased
operation and maintenance costs at USFE  and   

Lower
volumes as a result of customer switching in Ohio, net of retention by Duke
Energy Retail Sales, LLC (Duke Energy Retail) at Commercial Power.   

Segment Results   

In 2012, management
began evaluating segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is
defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling
interests. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues
and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In
conjunction with management s use of the new reporting measure, certain
governance costs that were previously unallocated have now been allocated to
each of the segments. In addition, direct interest expense and income taxes are
included in segment income. Prior year financial information has been recast to
conform to the current year presentation. None of these changes impacts the
reportable operating segments or the Duke Energy Registrants  previously
reported consolidated revenues, net income or EPS.   

  Management also uses adjusted
segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment and
Other performance. Adjusted segment income is a Non-GAAP financial measure, as
it is based upon segment income adjusted for special items and the
mark-to-market impact of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment.
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted segment income provides
useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional
relevant comparison of a segment s performance across periods.   

  The most directly
comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income is reported segment income,
which represents segment income from continuing operations, including any
special items and the mark-to-market impact of economic hedges in the
Commercial Power segment.  

  See Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Business Segments,  for a discussion of
Duke Energy s segment structure.   

  Duke Energy s segment income and adjusted segment income
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because
other entities may not calculate segment income or adjusted segment income in
the same manner. The following tables reconcile adjusted segment income to
segment income, and detailed discussions follow.

PART II   

Year  Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to December
31, 2011    

    Operating
revenues.     
   The
variance was driven primarily by:   

A
$4,918 million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of Progress
Energy operating revenues beginning in July 2012,  

A
$352 million net increase in retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to
revised retail rates resulting from the 2011 North Carolina and South Carolina
rate cases implemented in the first quarter of 2012, and revenues recognized
for energy efficiency programs, and  

A
$293 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven
primarily by higher revenues in Ohio for purchases of power as a result of the
new Ohio ESP, higher fuel rates for electric retail customers in all
jurisdictions, and higher revenues for purchases of power in Indiana and the
Carolinas, partially offset by decreased demand from electric retail customers
in 2012 mainly due to unfavorable weather conditions, and lower demand and fuel
rates in Ohio and Kentucky from natural gas retail customers . Fuel revenues
represent sales to retail and wholesale customers.  

  Partially offsetting
these increases was:   

A
$155 million decrease in electric and gas sales (net of fuel) to retail
customers due to unfavorable weather conditions in 2012 compared to 2011. For
the Carolinas, weather statistics for cooling degree days in 2012 were less
favorable compared to 2011, while cooling degree days in the Ohio and Indiana
were favorable in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. For the Carolinas,
Ohio and Indiana, weather statistics for heating degree days in 2012 were
unfavorable compared to 2011.  

    Operating
expenses.     
   The
increase was driven primarily by:   

A
$3,845 million increase in operating expenses due to the inclusion of Progress
Energy operating expenses beginning in July 2012,  

A
$378 million increase due to an additional impairment and other charges related
to the Edwardsport IGCC plant that is currently under construction. See Note 4
to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for
additional information,  

A
$277 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural
gas purchases for resale) primarily related to higher purchases of power in
Ohio as a result of the new Ohio ESP, higher volumes of natural gas used in
electric generation, higher coal prices, higher purchased power costs in Indiana
and the Carolinas, partially offset by lower volume of coal used in electric
generation resulting from unfavorable weather conditions and lower coal-fired
generation due to low natural gas prices, lower prices for natural gas used in
electric generation, and lower gas volumes and prices to full-service retail
gas customers, and  

A
$105 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to
increases in depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and
amortization of regulatory assets.   

  Partially offsetting
these increases was:   

A
$99 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to the
establishment of regulatory assets in the first quarter of 2012, pursuant to
regulatory orders, for future recovery of certain employee severance costs
related to the 2010 voluntary severance plan and other costs, and lower storm
costs, partially offset by increased costs associated with the energy
efficiency programs.    

    Other income and
expense, net.     The
variance was driven primarily by the inclusion of Progress Energy other income
and expenses beginning in July 2012.           

    Interest expense.     The variance was
primarily driven by     the inclusion of
Progress Energy interest expense beginning in July 2012.   

    Income tax expense.     The variance is primarily
due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate for the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 35.0% and 36.3%, respectively.

PART II   

Segment
income     .     The variance resulted
primarily from the inclusion of Progress Energy results beginning in July 2012,
higher net retail pricing and rate riders and decreased operating and
maintenance expenses. These positive impacts were partially offset by the
additional impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant,
unfavorable weather, and increased depreciation and amortization.   

Year Ended December
31, 2011 as Compared to December 31, 2010    

    Operating
revenues.     
   The
variance was driven primarily by:   

A
$230 million increase in rate riders and retail rates primarily due to the 2011
implementation of the North Carolina construction work in progress (CWIP)
rider, the save-a-watt (SAW) and demand side management programs, and the rider
for the Edwardsport IGCC plant,   

A
$22 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven
primarily by higher fuel rates for electric retail customers in all
jurisdictions, and higher purchased power costs in Indiana, partially offset by
decreased demand from electric retail customers in 2011 compared to the same
period in 2010 mainly due to less favorable weather conditions, lower demand
and fuel rates in Ohio and Kentucky from natural gas retail customers. Fuel
revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers, and   

An
$18 million net increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily
due to additional volumes and charges for capacity for customers served under
long-term contracts.   

  Partially
offsetting these increases was:   

A
$244 million decrease in GWh and thousand cubic feet (Mcf) sales to retail
customers due to less favorable weather conditions in 2011 compared to the same
period in 2010. For the Carolinas, Ohio and Indiana, weather statistics for
both heating degree days and cooling degree days in 2011 were unfavorable
compared to 2010. The year 2010 had the most cooling degree days on record and
December 2010 tied with December 1963 for the coldest December on record in the
Duke Energy Carolinas  service area (dating back to 1961).   

    Operating
expenses.     The
variance was driven primarily by:   

A
$204 million increase due to impairment charges, which primarily relate to an
additional impairment charge related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant that is
currently under construction. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information, and  

A
$110 million increase in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to
higher non-outage costs at nuclear and fossil generation stations, higher storm
costs, increased scheduled outage costs at nuclear generation stations, and increased
costs related to the implementation of the SAW program, partially offset by a
2010 litigation settlement.  

    Income tax expense.      The income tax
variance increase is primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The
effective tax rate for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was
36.3%.  

    Segment income.     As discussed above,
the variance resulted primarily from less favorable weather, impairment
charges, higher operating and maintenance expenses, and higher income tax
expense. These negative impacts were partially offset by overall net higher
retail rates and rate riders and higher wholesale power revenues.  

   Matters Impacting
Future USFE G Results    

  On December 27, 2012,
the IURC approved a settlement agreement between Duke Energy Indiana and certain
intervenors to cap the construction costs recoverable in retail rates. The Edwardsport
Generating Station (Edwardsport IGCC) plant is scheduled to begin commercial
operation in mid-2013. USFE G s earnings could be adversely impacted by
additional delays in the commencement of operations which may result in
increased costs.   

  USFE G currently
has pending rate cases in North Carolina and Ohio. USFE G also plans to
file rate cases in South Carolina before the end of 2013. These rate cases are
needed to recover the costs of plant modernization and other capital
investments in generation, transmission, and distribution systems, as well as
increased expenditures for nuclear plants and personnel, recovery of costs
associated with MGP sites, vegetation management and other operating costs.
USFE G s earnings could be adversely impacted if these rate cases are
denied or delayed by the NCUC, PSCSC or PUCO.  

  In
accordance with the terms of the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, with consumer
representatives and approved by the FPSC, Progress Energy Florida retains the
sole discretion and flexibility to retire Crystal River Unit 3. As a result of
the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, under the terms of the 2012 FPSC
Settlement Agreement, Progress Energy Florida is allowed to recover all
remaining Crystal River Unit 3 investments and to earn a return on the Crystal
River Unit 3 investments set at its current authorized overall cost of capital,
adjusted to reflect a return on equity set at 70 percent of the current FPSC
authorized return on equity, no earlier than the first billing cycle of January
2017. Progress Energy Florida expects that the FPSC will review the prudence of
the retirement decision in Phase 2 of the Crystal River Unit 3 delamination
regulatory docket. Progress Energy Florida has also asked the FPSC to review
the mediated resolution of insurance claims with NEIL as part of Phase 3 of
this regulatory docket. Phase 2 and Phase 3 hearings have been tentatively
scheduled to begin on June 19, 2013. USFE G s financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely impacted if the FPSC issues an
unfavorable ruling.  

  The ability to
integrate Progress Energy businesses and realize cost savings and any other
synergies expected from the merger with Progress Energy could be different from
what USFE G expects and may have a significant impact on USFE G s
results of operations.

PART II   

Year Ended December 31,
2012 as Compared to December 31, 2011    

    Operating revenues.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$285 million decrease in electric revenues from the coal-fired generation
assets driven primarily by the expiration of the 2009-2011 ESP which dedicated
Commercial Power s coal-fired generation to Duke Energy Ohio s retail
customers, net of stability charge revenues, partially offset by the coal-fired
generation assets participating in the   PJM
Interconnection, LLC (PJM)  
wholesale energy market in 2012,  

A
$116 million decrease in electric revenues from Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC
(Duke Energy Retail) resulting from lower volumes and unfavorable pricing,  

A $39
million decrease in electric revenues from the gas-fired generation assets
driven primarily by lower power prices, partially offset by increased volumes,  

A
$27 million decrease in electric revenues from Duke Energy Generation Services,
Inc. (DEGS), excluding renewables, due primarily to the termination of certain
operations at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and a reduction of coal
sales volumes as a result of lower natural gas prices,  

An
$18 million decrease in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared
capacity auction pricing in 2012 compared to 2011 for the gas-fired generation
assets, net of an increase associated with the move of the coal-fired
generation assets from Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc.
(MISO) to PJM in 2012, and  

An
$8 million decrease in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power and
capacity hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $6 million in
2012 compared to gains of $2 million in 2011.  

  Partially offsetting
these decreases were:   

A
$64 million increase from participation in competitive retail load auctions,
and  

A
$17 million increase in electric revenues from higher production in the
renewables portfolio.  

    Operating expenses.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$140 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses resulting primarily
from the prior year recognition of MISO exit fees; lower transmission costs,
prior year station outages, and 2011 regulatory asset amortization expenses,  

An
$88 million decrease primarily from the 2011 impairment of excess emission
allowances as a result of the EPA s issuance of the CSAPR,  

An
$85 million decrease in fuel expenses from the gas-fired generation assets
driven by lower natural gas costs, partially offset by higher volumes,  

A
$19 million decrease in DEGS, excluding renewables, fuel used due primarily to
the termination of certain operations at the end of the first quarter of 2011
and from lower natural gas prices,  

A
$15 million decrease due to the receipt of funds in 2012 related to a
previously written off receivable associated with the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy,  

A
$15 million decrease in purchased power to serve Duke Energy Retail customers,
and  

A
$13 million decrease in fuel used for the coal-fired generation assets driven
primarily by lower generation volumes.  

  Partially offsetting
these decreases was:  

A
$54 million increase in purchase power to serve competitive retail load
auctions.  

    Other income and
expense, net.     
   The
variance is primarily due to the sale of certain DEGS operations and higher
equity earnings from the renewables portfolio.  

    Interest expense.         The variance is
primarily due to higher capitalized interest on wind construction projects.  

    Income tax (benefit)
expense.    
The variance in tax benefit is primarily due to a decrease in pretax income.
The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was (9.5)
% and (1.4) %, respectively.    

    Segment income     .     The variance is
primarily attributable to lower revenues driven by the net impact of the
expiration of the 2009-2011 ESP and the impact of competitive market dispatch
for the Duke Energy Ohio coal-fired assets, lower Duke Energy Retail earnings,
and lower PJM capacity

revenues. These negative
impacts were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower impairment
charges, and increased margins from the gas-fired generation assets.  

   Year Ended December 31,
2011 as Compared to December 31, 2010    

    Operating revenues.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$240 million increase in wholesale electric revenues due to higher generation
volumes, net of lower pricing and lower margin earned from participation in
wholesale auctions in 2011, and   

A
$53 million increase in renewable generation revenues due to additional
renewable generation facilities placed in service after 2010 and a full year of
operations for renewable generation facilities placed in service throughout
2010.   

Partially
offsetting these increases were:   

A
$178 million decrease in retail electric revenues resulting from lower sales
volumes driven by increased customer switching levels and unfavorable weather
net of higher retail pricing under the ESP in 2011, and   

A
$66 million decrease in DEGS revenues, excluding renewables, due primarily to a
contract termination and plant maintenance.   

    Operating
expenses.     The
variance was primarily driven by:   

A
$584 million decrease in impairment charges primarily related to a $660 million
charge related to goodwill and nonregulated coal-fired generation asset
impairments in the Midwest in 2010, as compared to a $79 million impairment in
2011 to write down the carrying value of excess emission allowances held to
fair value as a result of the EPA s issuance of the Cross-State Air Pollution
Rule (CSAPR) and a $9 million impairment of the Vermillion generation station
in 2011. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Goodwill,
Intangible Assets and Impairments,  for additional information, and   

A
$65 million decrease in retail fuel and purchased power expenses due to lower
generation volumes net of higher purchased power volumes in 2011 as compared to
2010.   

  Partially
offsetting these decreases were:   

A
$156 million increase in wholesale fuel expenses due to higher generation
volumes, partially offset by favorable hedge realizations in 2011 as compared
to 2010,   

A
$46 million increase in operating expenses resulting primarily from the
recognition of MISO exit fees, higher maintenance expenses and higher
transmission costs, partially offset by lower governance costs in 2011 compared
to 2010, and   

A
$30 million increase in mark-to-market fuel expense on non-qualifying fuel
hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $3 million in 2011
compared to gains of $27 million in 2010.   

    Other
income and expense, net.     The variance is primarily due to distributions
from South Houston Green Power received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011.   

    Interest
expense.    
The variance is primarily due to lower capitalized interest on wind
construction projects.  

    Income
tax (benefit) expense.     The variance in pretax income was primarily due to a
non-deductible goodwill impairment in 2010. The effective tax rates for the
year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, were (1.4%) and (7.2%), respectively.  

    Segment
income     .
   The
variance is primarily attributable to lower goodwill, generation and other
asset impairment charges, higher wholesale margins due to increased generation
volumes, and an increase in renewables generation revenues. These factors were
partially offset by lower retail margins driven by customer switching and unfavorable
weather, higher operating expenses resulting from the recognition of MISO exit
fees and increased maintenance expenses, and net mark-to-market losses on
non-qualifying commodity hedge contracts in 2011 compared to gains in 2010.   

   Matters Impacting Future
Commercial Power Results    

  Changes or variability
in assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the renewables reporting
unit for goodwill testing purposes including but not limited to, legislative
actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rates and discount
rates, could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the renewables
reporting unit. In the event of a significant decline in the estimated fair
value of the renewables reporting unit, goodwill and other asset impairment
charges could be recorded. The carrying value of goodwill, and intangible
assets associated with proposed renewable projects within Commercial Power s
renewables reporting unit was approximately $108 million at December 31, 2012.  

  The current low energy
price projections, as well as recently issued and proposed environmental
regulations pertaining to coal and coal-fired generating  facilities, could
impact future cash flows and market valuations of Commercial Power s coal-fired
generation assets which could lead to impairment charges.

The variance was driven primarily by current year impairments and prior year
gains on sales of investments, higher interest income recorded in 2011
following the resolution of certain income tax matters related to prior years
and reversal of reserves related to certain guarantees Duke Energy had issued
on behalf of Crescent in 2011. These negative impacts were partially offset by
higher returns on investments that support benefit obligations in 2012 compared
to 2011.  

    Interest expense.     The variance was due
primarily to higher debt balances as a result of debt issuances and the
inclusion of Progress Energy interest expense beginning in July 2012.  

    Income tax benefit.     The variance is
primarily due to an increase in pretax loss. The effective tax rate for the
years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 41.1% and 56.0%, respectively.  

    Net expense.     The variance was due
primarily to charges related to the Progress Energy merger, increased severance

variance was driven primarily by $172 million of 2010 employee severance costs
related to the voluntary severance plan and the consolidation of certain
corporate office functions from the Midwest to Charlotte, North Carolina, prior
year donations of $56 million to the Duke Energy Foundation, which is a nonprofit
organization funded by Duke Energy shareholders that makes charitable
contributions to selected nonprofits and government subdivisions, a decrease as
a result of the DukeNet deconsolidation in December 2010 and the subsequent

DukeNet deconsolidation in December 2010 and the subsequent accounting for Duke
Energy s investment in DukeNet as an equity method investment, and higher
interest expense due to increased debt issuances in the current year. These
negative impacts were partially offset by prior year impairments and 2011 gains
on sales of investments and higher income tax benefit due to increased net

   Matters Impacting
Future Other Results    

  Duke Energy previously
held an effective 50% interest in Crescent, which was a real estate joint
venture formed by Duke Energy in 2006 that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in June 2009. On June 9, 2010, Crescent restructured and emerged
from bankruptcy and Duke Energy forfeited its entire 50% ownership interest to
Crescent debt holders. This forfeiture caused Duke Energy to recognize a loss, for
tax purposes, on its interest in the second quarter of 2010. Although Crescent
has reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy with creditors owning all Crescent
interest, there remains uncertainty as to the tax treatment associated with the
restructuring. Based on this uncertainty, it is possible that Duke Energy could
incur a future tax liability related to the tax losses associated with its
partnership interest in Crescent and the resolution of issues associated with
Crescent s emergence from bankruptcy.

The
increase in Duke Energy Carolinas  net income for the year ended December 31,
2012, compared to December 31, 2011, was primarily due to the following
factors:   

    Operating
revenues.     The
variance was primarily due to:   

A
$323 million increase in net retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to
revised retail base rates implemented in North Carolina and South Carolina in
the first quarter of 2012, and revenues recognized for the energy efficiency
programs, and  

A
$40 million increase in weather adjusted sales volumes to customers primarily
due to higher weather-normal sales to retail customers and an extra day of
revenues due to 2012 being a leap year.  

             Partially
offsetting these increases were:   

A
$141 million (net of fuel) decrease in GWh sales to retail customers due to
overall unfavorable weather conditions. The weather statistics for heating
degree days in 2012 were unfavorable compared to the same period in 2011, while
weather statistics for cooling degree days were less favorable in 2012 compared
to the same period in 2011, and  

              An $88 million
decrease in fuel revenues driven primarily by decreased demand from retail
customers mainly due to overall unfavorable weather conditions, partially
offset by higher fuel rates in both North Carolina and South Carolina.  Fuel revenues
represent sales to retail and wholesale customers.  

    Operating
expenses.     The
variance was primarily due to   :     

A
$107 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to
increases in depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and
amortization of certain regulatory assets,   

48   

PART II   

A $75 million increase
in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to Duke Energy Carolinas 
portion of the costs associated with the Progress Energy merger including
donations, severance, and certain other costs, higher non-outage and outage
costs at generation plants, increased corporate costs, and required donations
resulting from the most recent North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases,
partially offset by the establishment of regulatory assets in the first quarter
of 2012, pursuant to regulatory orders for future recovery of certain employee
severance costs related to the 2010 voluntary severance plan and other costs,
decreased storm costs, and lower governance costs, and  

A
$25 million increase in general taxes primarily due to higher revenue related
taxes in 2012, higher North Carolina property tax expense, capitalization of
North Carolina property taxes in the prior year related to future generation
plants, a favorable prior year resolution of a property tax issue related to
pollution control equipment exemptions and a sales and use tax refund in 2011
with no comparable refund in 2012, and  

A
$19 million increase in impairment charges primarily related to the merger with
Progress Energy. These charges relate to planned transmission project costs for
which no recovery is expected, and certain costs associated with mitigation
sales pursuant to merger settlement agreements with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC).  

  Partially
offsetting these increases was:   

An
$80 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily
related to lower volume of coal used in electric generation due to lower demand
from retail customers based on overall unfavorable weather conditions and lower
coal-fired generation due to low natural gas prices.  

    Interest expense.     The variance is
primarily due to lower debt return on deferred projects and a lower debt
component of allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).  

    Income tax expense.     The variance in income
tax expense is primarily due to prior year state audit settlements. The
effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 34.3% and
36.1%, respectively.   

   Matters Impacting
Future Duke Energy Carolinas Results    

  Duke Energy Carolinas
filed a rate case on February 4, 2013 in North Carolina and plans to file a
rate case in South Carolina in early 2013. These planned rates cases are needed
to recover investments in Duke Energy Carolinas  ongoing infrastructure
modernization projects and operating costs. Duke Energy Carolinas  earnings
could be adversely impacted if these rate cases are denied or delayed by either
of the state regulatory commissions.   

  The ability to
integrate Progress Energy businesses and realize cost savings and any other
synergies expected from the merger with Progress Energy could be different from
what Duke Energy Carolinas expects and may have a significant impact on Duke
Energy Carolinas  results of operations.

Form 10-K.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS    

The
decrease in Progress Energy s net income for the year ended December 31, 2012
compared to December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the following factors:  

    Operating
revenues.     The
variance was primarily due to:   

A
$319 million increase in fuel and capacity revenues driven primarily by the
2011 charge of $288 million for the amount to be refunded through the fuel
clause in accordance with the 2012 settlement agreement at Progress Energy
Florida, and  

A
$154 million increase in sales to wholesale customers primarily due to Progress
Energy Carolinas  joint dispatch agreement (JDA) revenues from Duke Energy
Carolinas, the impact of an amended capacity contract with a major wholesale
customer at Progress Energy Carolinas that began in May 2012 and a new
wholesale contract at Progress Energy Carolinas that began in July 2012.    

  Partially
offsetting these increases was:   

An
$86 million decrease in sales to retail customers primarily due to unfavorable
weather conditions. The weather statistics for heating degree days in 2012 were
unfavorable compared to the same period in 2011, while weather statistics for
cooling degree days were less favorable in 2012 compared to the same period in
2011.  

    Operating
expenses.     The
variance was primarily due to:   

A
$385 million increase in Operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due
to higher costs to achieve the merger with Duke Energy and Progress Energy
Carolinas  higher nuclear plant outage costs, and   

A
$261 million increase in Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power
primarily due to the impact of establishing a $100 million regulatory liability
for replacement power in accordance with Progress Energy Florida s 2012 FPSC
settlement agreement (See Note 4), the impact of higher rates at Progress
Energy Carolinas and a change in generation mix at Progress Energy Carolinas,
which was driven by nuclear refueling outages in 2012.  

A
$197 million increase in Impairment charges primarily due to the impact of the
decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3 (See Note 4) and the probable
disallowance of transmission project costs at Progress Energy Carolinas, which
are a portion of the FERC Mitigation charges (See Note 2) included in the costs
to achieve the merger with Duke Energy.    

    Other
income and expenses, net.     The variance was primarily due to the $59
million prior-year pretax unrealized loss to record the change in fair value of
the contingent value obligations (CVOs). The change in fair value was
determined by an October 3, 2011 settlement agreement with a CVO holder to
purchase all of their CVOs at a negotiated purchase price. The settlement
agreement also led to a subsequent tender offer to remaining CVO holders at the
same purchase price.  

    Income
tax expense.     The
variance was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income. The effective tax
rates for 2012 and 2011 were 32.7% and 35.6%, respectively. The decrease in the
effective tax rate is primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income as well
as the decrease for the change of fair value of outstanding CVOs.   

    Discontinued
operations, net of tax.     The variance was primarily due to the impact of the US
Global settlement in 2012 (See Note 5).

PART II   

In accordance with the terms of a 2012 FPSC Settlement
Agreement, with consumer representatives and approved by the FPSC, Progress
Energy Florida retains the sole discretion and flexibility to retire Crystal
River Unit 3. As a result of the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, under
the terms of the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, Progress Energy Florida is
allowed to recover all remaining Crystal River Unit 3 investments and to earn a
return on the Crystal River Unit 3 investments set at its current authorized
overall cost of capital, adjusted to reflect a return on equity set at 70
percent of the current FPSC authorized return on equity, no earlier than the
first billing cycle of January 2017. Progress Energy Florida expects that the
FPSC will review the prudence of the retirement decision in Phase 2 of the
Crystal River Unit 3 delamination regulatory docket. Progress Energy Florida
has also asked the FPSC to review the mediated resolution of insurance claims
with NEIL as part of Phase 3 of this regulatory docket. Phase 2 and Phase 3
hearings have been tentatively scheduled to begin on June 19, 2013. Progress
Energy s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
impacted if the FPSC issues an unfavorable ruling.  

  Progress Energy
Carolinas filed a rate case in North Carolina in October 2012, and plans to
file a rate case in South Carolina before the end of 2013. These rate cases are
needed to recover the cost of plant modernization and other capital investments
in generation, transmission and distribution systems, as well as increased
expenditures for nuclear plants and personnel, vegetation management and other
operating costs. Progress Energy s earnings could be adversely impacted if
these rate cases are denied or delayed by the NCUC or PSCSC.  

  The ability to
integrate with Duke Energy businesses and realize cost savings and any other
synergies expected from the merger with Duke Energy could be different from
what Progress Energy expects and may have a significant impact on Progress
Energy s results of operations.

The decrease in
Progress Energy Carolinas  net income for the year ended December 31, 2012
compared to December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the following factors:   

    Operating Revenues.     The variance was
primarily due to:   

A
$139 million increase in sales to wholesale customers primarily due to JDA
revenues from Duke Energy Carolinas, the impact of an amended capacity contract
with a major wholesale customer that began in May 2012 and a new wholesale
contract that began in July 2012,  

A
$53 million increase in fuel revenues driven primarily by Interim FERC
Mitigation wholesale fuel revenue and higher fuel rates, and  

A
$19 million increase in clause-recoverable regulatory revenues primarily due to
increased spending on new and existing DSM programs.  

  Partially offsetting
these increases was:   

A
$67 million decrease in sales to retail customers primarily due to unfavorable
weather conditions. The number of heating degree days for the 12 months ended
December 31, 2012 was 19% below normal compared to 9% below normal for the same
period in 2011. In addition, cooling degree days for the 12 months ended
December 31, 2012 were 3% above normal compared to 19% above normal in the same
period in 2011.   

    Operating Expenses.     The variance was
primarily due to   :     

A
$303 million increase in Operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to
higher nuclear plant outage costs, higher costs to achieve the merger with Duke
Energy and the prior year non-capital portion of a favorable judgment from
spent fuel litigation, partially offset by lower storm costs. The higher
nuclear plant outage costs are primarily due to three nuclear refueling outages
in 2012 compared to one outage in 2011,  

52   

PART II   

A $140 million
increase in Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due
to the impact of higher rates; higher weather-adjusted volumes and increased purchased
power, which was driven by favorable gas prices and nuclear plant outages; and
generation mix, which was driven by nuclear plant outages, and  

A
$51 million increase in Impairment charges primarily due to the disallowance of
transmission project costs, which are a portion of the FERC Mitigation charges
included in the costs to achieve the merger with Duke Energy.  

    Interest Expense.     The variance was
primarily due to higher interest expense on long-term debt due to higher
average debt outstanding and the prior-year settlement of 2004 and 2005 income
tax audits.  

    Income Tax Expense.     The variance was
primarily due to a decrease in pretax net income. The effective tax rate for
the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 28.7% and 33.2%, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the decrease in
pretax income.

The decrease in
Progress Energy Florida s net income for the year ended December 31, 2012
compared to December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the following factors:   

    Operating Revenues.     The variance was
primarily due to:   

A
$266 million increase in fuel and capacity revenues driven primarily by the
2011 charge of $288 million for the amount to be refunded through the fuel
clause in accordance with the 2012 FPSC settlement agreement and the impact of
higher residential fuel rates, partially offset by unfavorable weather
conditions that impacted wholesale and retail fuel revenues. Also, Progress
Energy Florida had lower capacity revenues resulting from a lower capacity rate
and the lower sales volume,  

A
$28 million increase in other operating revenues primarily due to higher OATT
rates, and  

A
$15 million increase in sales to wholesale customers primarily due to a new
contract with a major customer.  

  Partially offsetting
these increases was:   

A
$19 million decrease in sales to retail customers due to unfavorable weather
conditions. The number of heating degree days for the 12 months ended December
31, 2012 was 22% below normal compared to 12% below normal in the same period
in 2011. In addition, cooling degree days for the 12 months ended December 31,
2012 were 4% above normal compared to 5% above normal in the same period in
2011.   

    Operating Expenses.     The variance was
primarily due to   :     

A
$146 million increase in Impairment charges due to the impact of the decision
to retire Crystal River Unit 3 (See Note 4),  

54   

PART II   

A $121 million
increase in Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due
to the impact of establishing a regulatory liability for replacement power in
accordance with the 2012 FPSC settlement agreement (See Note 4), and an
increase in deferred fuel expense related to higher under-recovered fuel costs
in 2011 as a result of higher system requirements driven by favorable weather
in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by lower natural gas
prices and lower system requirements as a result of unfavorable weather
conditions in the current year and a lower Crystal River Unit 3 indemnification
charge for the estimated joint owner replacement power costs,  

An
$86 million increase in Operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to
higher costs to achieve the merger with Duke Energy, and  

A
$23 million increase in Depreciation and amortization primarily due to a
decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization
expense as allowed under the 2012 and 2010 settlement agreements (See Note 4)
and higher Environmental Cost Recovery Clause (ECRC) amortization due to less
over-recovery, partially offset by lower nuclear cost-recovery amortization
primarily related to the Levy nuclear station project.  

    Interest Expense.     The variance was
primarily due to the prior-year favorable settlement of 2004 and 2005 income
tax audits.  

    Income Tax Expense.     The variance was
primarily due to a decrease in pretax net income. The effective tax rate for
the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 35.7% and 36.3%, respectively  .

The
decrease in Duke Energy Ohio s net income for the year ended December 31, 2012
compared to December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the following factors:   

    Operating
revenues.     The
variance was primarily driven by:   

A
$285 million decrease in electric revenues from the coal-fired generation
assets driven primarily by the expiration of the 2009-2011 ESP, net of
stability charge revenues, partially offset by the coal-fired generation assets
participating in the PJM wholesale energy market in 2012,  

A
$39 million decrease in electric revenues from the gas-fired generation assets
driven primarily by lower power prices, partially offset by increased volumes,
and  

An
$18 million decrease in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared
capacity auction pricing in 2012 compared to 2011 for the gas-fired generation
assets, net of an increase associated with the move of the coal-fired assets
from MISO to PJM in 2012.  

  Partially
offsetting these decreases were:   

A
$279 million increase in regulated fuel and purchased power revenues driven
primarily by higher purchased power revenues collected under the new Ohio ESP
which became effective January 1, 2012, partially offset by reduced gas sales
volumes and lower natural gas costs, and  

A
$32 million increase in retail Ohio electric energy efficiency rider revenue
resulting primarily from the approval of the final save-a-watt order for the
years 2009-2012.  

    Operating expenses.     The variance was
primarily driven by:   

A
$101 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses resulting primarily
from prior year recognition of MISO exit fees, higher prior year station
outages, and regulatory asset amortization expenses,  

An
$88 million decrease primarily from the 2011 impairment of excess emission
allowances as a result of the EPA s issuance of the Cross-State Air Pollution
Rule (CSAPR), and  

56   

PART II   

An
$85 million decrease in fuel expense from the gas-fired generation assets
driven by lower natural gas costs, partially offset by higher volumes.  

  Partially
offsetting these decreases was:   

A
$274 million increase in regulated fuel expense driven primarily by higher
purchased power expense as a result of the new ESP, partially offset by reduced
gas sales volumes and lower natural gas costs.  

    Interest
expense.     The
variance was primarily due to lower average debt balances in 2012 compared to
2011 and post in-service carrying charges related to new projects.  

    Income tax expense.     The variance in tax
expense is primarily due to an increase in the effective tax rate. The
effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 36.0% and
33.1%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to
a $10 million reduction of deferred tax liabilities as a result of an election
related to the transfer of certain gas-fired generation assets to its wholly
owned subsidiary Duke Energy Commercial Asset Management, LLC (DECAM) in the
second quarter of 2011.     

Matters Impacting
Future Duke Energy Ohio Results    

  Duke
Energy Ohio filed electric and gas distribution rate cases in July 2012. These
planned rate cases are needed to recover capital investments, costs associated
with MGP sites and operating costs. Duke Energy Ohio s earnings could be
adversely impacted if these rate cases are denied or delayed by the state
regulatory commission.   

  The current low energy
price projections, as well as recently issued and proposed environmental
regulations pertaining to coal and coal-fired generating  facilities, could
impact future cash flows and market valuations of Duke Energy Ohio s coal-fired
generation assets which could lead to impairment charges.

Energy Indiana s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to net
income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the following
factors:   

    Operating
Revenues.     The
variance was primarily due to:   

A
$102 million net increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) primarily
due to an increase in fuel rates as a result of higher fuel and purchased power
costs,  

A
$17 million net increase in rate riders primarily related to higher recoveries
under the clean coal technology and energy efficiency riders, and   

A
$12 million increase in rate pricing due to the positive impact on overall
average prices of lower sales volumes.  

  Partially offsetting
these increases were:  

A
$31 million decrease in retail revenue due to a regulatory order to refund
revenues to customers related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant that is currently
under construction.  See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 Regulatory Matters,  for additional information, and  

A
$7 million decrease in retail revenues related to less favorable weather
conditions and weather-normal sales volumes in 2012 compared to 2011.  

    Operating
Expenses.     The
variance was primarily due to:   

              A $378 million
increase due to impairment and other charges recorded in 2012 related to the
Edwardsport IGCC plant that is currently under construction of $600 million,
partially offset by a 2011 Edwardsport IGCC impairment charge of $222 million. 
See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for
additional information, and  

A
$102 million increase in fuel costs primarily due to an increase in fuel rates
as a result of higher fuel and purchased power costs.  

  Partially offsetting
these increases were:   

58   

PART II   

A $29 million decrease
in operation and maintenance primarily due to higher storm costs in the prior
year, and lower generation and outage maintenance costs in 2012, partially
offset by higher energy efficiency program costs.  

    Income Tax (Benefit)
Expense.     The
variance in income tax expense is primarily due to a decrease in pretax income.
The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were
59.5% and 30.6%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is
primarily due to the decrease in pretax income in 2012 related to the
Edwardsport IGCC project.  

   Matters Impacting
Future Duke Energy Indiana Results    

  On December 27, 2012,
the IURC approved a settlement agreement between Duke Energy Indiana and
certain intervenors to cap the construction costs recoverable in retail rates.
The Edwardsport IGCC plant is scheduled to begin commercial operation in
mid-2013. Duke Energy Indiana s earnings could be adversely impacted by
additional delays in the commencement of operations which may result in
increased costs.

PART II   

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES    

The
application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that
continues to develop as Duke Energy s operations change and accounting guidance
evolves. Duke Energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies
and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments.   

  Management
bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various
assumptions that it believes are reasonable at the time of application. The
estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about
Duke Energy s environment becomes available. If estimates and judgments are
different than the actual amounts recorded, adjustments are made in subsequent
periods to take into consideration the new information. Duke Energy discusses
its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting
policies with senior members of management and the audit committee, as
appropriate. Duke Energy s critical accounting policies and estimates are
discussed below.   

Regulatory
Accounting    

Duke
Energy s regulated operations (the substantial majority of U.S. Franchised
Electric and Gas s operations) meet the criteria for application of regulatory
accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy records assets and liabilities
that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded
under GAAP in the U.S. for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally
represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are
probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally
represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for
costs that have yet to be incurred. Management continually assesses whether the
regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such
as applicable regulatory environment changes, historical regulatory treatment
for similar costs in Duke Energy s jurisdictions, litigation of rate orders,
recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending
or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment,
management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery.
This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the
state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future
recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the asset write-offs would be required
to be recognized in operating income. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can
provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property,
plant and equipment, recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and
amortization of regulatory assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion
of certain assets. Total regulatory assets for Duke Energy were $11,741 million
and $4,046 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Total
regulatory liabilities were $5,740 million and $3,006 million as of December
31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increases in regulatory assets and
liabilities are driven primarily by the Progress Energy merger. For further
information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory
Matters.    

  In order
to apply regulatory accounting treatment and record regulatory assets and
liabilities, certain criteria must be met. In determining whether the criteria
are met for its operations, management makes significant judgments, including
determining whether revenue rates for services provided to customers are
subject to approval by an independent, third-party regulator, whether the
regulated rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing the
regulated service, and a determination of whether, in view of the demand for
the regulated services and the level of competition, it is reasonable to assume
that rates set at levels that will recover the operations  costs can be charged
to and collected from customers. This final criterion requires consideration of
anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition, direct and indirect,
during the recovery period for any capitalized costs.   

  The
regulatory accounting rules require recognition of a loss if it becomes
probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction or a recently
completed plant will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable
estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments can
require significant judgment by management regarding matters such as the
ultimate cost of a plant under construction, regulatory recovery implications,
etc. As discussed in Note 4,  Regulatory Matters,  during 2012, 2011 and 2010
Duke Energy Indiana recorded charges of $631 million, $222 million and $44
million, respectively, related to the IGCC plant currently under construction
in Edwardsport, Indiana. Management will continue to assess matters as the
construction of the plant and the related regulatory proceedings continue, and
further charges could be required in 2013 or beyond. Also as discussed in Note
2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Acquisitions and Sales of Other
Assets , Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas recorded disallowance
charges in 2012 in order to gain FERC approval of the merger between Duke
Energy and Progress Energy.  

  As
discussed further in Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and
Note 4,  Regulatory Matters,  Duke Energy Ohio discontinued the application of
regulatory accounting treatment to portions of its generation operations in
November 2011 in conjunction with the approval of its new Electric Security
Plan by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. The effect of this change was
immaterial to the financial statements.   

Goodwill
Impairment Assessments    

Duke
Energy s goodwill balances are included in the following table.   

The Duke Energy
allocates goodwill to a reporting unit, which Duke Energy defines as an
operating segment or one level below an operating segment. During 2012, Duke
Energy recorded $12,467 million of goodwill associated with the merger with
Progress Energy. This goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over
the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the
acquisition date, and was preliminarily allocated entirely to the USFE G
segment. The goodwill recognized is subject to change as additional information
is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date. See Note 2,  Acquisitions and Sales of Other Assets,  for
additional information on the merger with Progress Energy.  

  The remainder of
USFE G s goodwill relates to the acquisition of Cinergy in April 2006.
Commercial Power s goodwill resulted from the 2008 acquisition of Catamount Energy
Corporation, a leading wind power company located in Rutland, Vermont, and has
been allocated to the Renewables reporting unit. International Energy s
goodwill resulted from various acquisitions, including $59 million from the
2012 acquisition of Iberoamericana de Energia Ibener S.A. in Chile. See Note 2,
 Acquisitions and Sales of Other Assets,  for additional information.  

60   

PART II   

Duke
Energy recorded impairments of $500 million related to Commercial Power s nonregulated
Midwest generation reporting unit in 2010. Subsequent to the 2010 impairment
charge there is no recorded amount of goodwill at Commercial Power s nonregulated
Midwest generation reporting unit. These impairment charges are recorded in
Goodwill and Other Impairment Charges on Duke Energy s Consolidated Statement
of Operations. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Goodwill,
Intangible Assets and Impairments  for further information regarding the
factors impacting the valuation of Commercial Power s nonregulated generation
reporting unit. Duke Energy determined that no other goodwill impairments
existed in 2012, 2011, and 2010.   

  As discussed in Note 12
to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Goodwill, Intangible Assets and
Impairments,  Duke Energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at the
reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if events or
circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value. Duke Energy evaluates the carrying
amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of
August 31 and performs interim impairment tests if a triggering event
occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying value.   

  The analysis of the
potential impairment of goodwill may first consider qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50 percent
chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value.
This is sometimes referred to as  step zero  and is an optional step in the
annual goodwill impairment analysis. If the results of qualitative assessments
indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less
than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the two-step impairment test is
required. Step one of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of
reporting units with their carrying values, including goodwill. If the carrying
amount is less than fair value in step one, further testing of goodwill is not
performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting
unit s fair value, step two must be performed to determine the amount, if any,
of the goodwill impairment loss. Step two of the goodwill impairment test
involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill
against the carrying value of the goodwill. Under step two, determining the
implied fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit s
identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting
unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date. The
difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in
step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities
represents the implied fair value of goodwill. The goodwill impairment charge,
if any, would be the difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and the
implied fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two.   

  As a result of the
acquisition of Progress Energy, Duke Energy performed step one of the goodwill
impairment test as of August 31, 2012, and concluded the fair value of each of
its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values, and thus, did
not record any impairment charges. In 2011, Duke Energy performed the
qualitative assessments under step zero and concluded that it was more likely
than not the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
Thus, the two step goodwill impairment test was not necessary in 2011.    

  When performing step
zero of the goodwill impairment test, Duke Energy s qualitative assessments
include reviews of current forecasts compared to prior forecasts, consideration
of recent fair value calculations, if any, review of the stock price
performance of Duke Energy and its peers, credit ratings of Duke Energy s
significant subsidiaries, updates to weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
calculations or review of the key inputs to the WACC and consideration of overall
economic factors, recent regulatory commission actions and related regulatory
climates, and recent financial performance.   

  For purposes of the
step one analyses, determination of the reporting units  fair values is based
on a combination of the income approach, which estimates the fair value of Duke
Energy s reporting units based on discounted future cash flows, and the market
approach, which estimates the fair value of Duke Energy s reporting units based
on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Generally, more
emphasis is applied to the income approach as it represents management s best
estimate of future value. Key assumptions used in the income approach analyses
include, but are not limited to, estimated future cash flows and the use of an
appropriate discount rate. The market approach uses implied market multiples
derived from comparable peer utilities and market transactions to estimate the
fair value.   

  Estimated future cash
flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on Duke Energy s
internal business plan, and adjusted as appropriate for Duke Energy s views of
market participant assumptions. Duke Energy s internal business plan reflects
management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal
data and economic data obtained from third party sources, projected commodity
pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations. The business
plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the
outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of returns on equity,
anticipated earnings/returns related to significant future capital investments,
continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts.
Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operation,
maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome
of the aforementioned events. In estimating cash flows, Duke Energy
incorporates expected growth rates, regulatory and economic stability, the
ability to renew contracts and other factors, into its revenue and expense
forecasts. Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ
significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow
assumptions could cause the fair value of Duke Energy s reporting units to be
significantly different in future periods.   

  One of the most
significant assumptions that Duke Energy utilizes in determining the fair value
of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied
to the estimated future cash flows. Management determines the appropriate
discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the WACC for each
individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the pre-tax cost of
debt and cost of equity (a major component of the cost of equity is the current
risk-free rate on twenty year U.S. Treasury bonds). In the 2012 step one
impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACC s for certain peer
companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As
each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its
operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting
unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account
for company specific risk premiums. For example, transmission and distribution
reporting units generally would have a lower company specific risk premium as
they do not have the higher level of risk associated with owning and operating
generation assets nor do they have significant construction risk or risk
associated with potential future carbon legislation or pending EPA regulations.
The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2012,
for each of Duke Energy s domestic reporting units were commensurate with the
risks associated with each reporting unit and ranged from 5.2% to 7.1%. For
Duke Energy s international operations, a country specific risk adder based on
the average of risk premium for each separate jurisdiction in which
International Energy operates was added to the base discount rate to reflect
the differing risk profiles of the jurisdictions and countries. This resulted
in a discount rate for the August 31, 2012 goodwill impairment test for the
international operations of 8.5%.  

  The underlying
assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent changes,
particularly changes in the discount rates or growth rates inherent in
management s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment
charges. Management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair
value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill
for impairment as appropriate.   

  The majority of Duke
Energy s business is in environments that are either fully or partially
rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted
periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales
volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy s regulated utilities operate
to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of
significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, changes in
discount rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of equity. As of
August 31, 2012, all of the USFE G      

61   

PART II   

reporting
units  estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by
more than 10%, except Progress Energy Florida which has preliminarily been
allocated goodwill of $2,457 million. Management will continue to monitor changes
in the business, as well as overall market conditions and economic factors that
could require additional impairment tests.  

  As discussed in Note 12
to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Goodwill, Intangible Assets and
Impairments , the fair value of USFE G s Progress Energy Florida reporting
unit and Commercial Power s Renewables reporting unit are impacted by a
multitude of factors, including legislative actions related to tax credit
extensions, long-term growth rate assumptions, the market price of power and
discount rates. As of December 31, 2012, the Progress Energy Florida reporting
unit and the Renewables reporting unit s estimated fair value of equity
exceeded the carrying value of equity by less than 10%. Management continues to
monitor these assumptions for any indicators that the fair value of the
reporting unit could be below the carrying value, and will assess goodwill for
impairment as appropriate  

Long-Lived
Asset Impairment Assessments    

Property, plant and
equipment is stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated
depreciation or fair value, if impaired. Duke Energy evaluates property, plant
and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The
determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. Performing an impairment evaluation involves a
significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying
circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping
affected assets, and developing the undiscounted future cash flows associated
with the asset. Additionally, determining the fair value of the asset requires
probability weighting the future cash flows to reflect expectations about
possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an
appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant
information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future
cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from
actual results. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the asset and
recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the
estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an
impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated
fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.   

  When it becomes
probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets have
been abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The
value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned
property is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated
rates, including any return. As such, an impairment charge could be offset by
the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable.   

  As discussed further
in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Goodwill, Intangible
Assets and Impairments,  in the third quarter of 2012, Duke Energy Carolinas
and Progress Energy Carolinas recorded certain impairment charges in
conjunction with the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. In the
third quarter of 2011, Commercial Power recorded $79 million of pre-tax
impairment charges related to Clean Air Act emission allowances which were no
longer expected to be used as a result of the issuance of the final Cross State
Air Pollution Rule. In the second quarter of 2010, Commercial Power recorded
$160 million of pre-tax impairment charges related to certain generating assets
and emission allowances in the Midwest to write-down the value of these assets
to their estimated fair value, which was impacted by the EPA s rules on
emissions of NO x  and SO 2 . These impairment charges are
recorded in Goodwill and Other Impairment Charges on Duke Energy s Consolidated
Statement of Operations.   

Revenue
Recognition    

Revenues on sales of
electricity and gas are recognized when either the service is provided or the
product is delivered. Operating revenues include unbilled electric and gas
revenues earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of
the accounting period. Unbilled retail revenues are estimated by applying an
average revenue per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or per Mcf for all customer classes to
the number of estimated kWh or Mcf delivered but not billed. Unbilled wholesale
energy revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per
megawatt-hour (MWh) to the number of estimated MWh delivered but not yet billed.
Unbilled wholesale demand revenues are calculated by applying the contractual
rate per MW to the MW volume delivered but not yet billed. The amount of
unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of
numerous factors, including seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns,
customer mix and the average price in effect for customer classes.   

  At December 31, 2012
and 2011, Duke Energy had $920 million and $674 million, respectively, of
unbilled revenues within Restricted Receivables of Variable Interest Entities
and Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

Accounting
for Loss Contingencies    

Duke Energy is
involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal
course of business. In the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements, management makes judgments regarding the future outcome of
contingent events and records a loss contingency when it is determined that it
is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. Management regularly reviews current information available to
determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are
required. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts
and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third
parties, such as federal, state and local courts and other regulators.
Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Amounts
recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual
outcome once the contingency is resolved, which could have a material impact on
future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy.

Duke Energy Carolinas
has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost
reimbursement relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen
from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and
maintenance activities conducted by Duke Energy Carolinas on its electric generation
plants prior to 1985. Amounts recognized as asbestos-related reserves in the
respective Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $751 million and $801 million as
of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are classified in Other within
Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities.
These reserves are based upon the minimum amount in Duke Energy s best estimate
of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through 2030.
Management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims filed
against Duke Energy after 2030. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a
longer-term forecast, management does not believe that they can reasonably
estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2030
related to such potential claims. Asbestos-related loss estimates incorporate
anticipated inflation, if applicable, and are recorded on an undiscounted
basis. These reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to
greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. A significant upward or
downward trend in the number of claims filed, the nature of the alleged injury,
and the average cost of resolving each such claim could change our estimated
liability, as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial. A
federal legislative solution, further state tort reform or structured
settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability. Given the
uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous
other factors outside our control, management believes that it is possible Duke
Energy may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves.   

62   

PART II   

Duke
Energy Carolinas has a third-party insurance policy to cover certain losses
related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self
insured retention of $476 million. Duke Energy s cumulative payments began to
exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy in 2008. Future
payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by Duke Energy s third party
insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit for potential future insurance
recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is $935 million
in excess of the self insured retention. Insurance recoveries of $781 million
and $813 million related to this policy are classified in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets in Other within Investments and Other Assets and Receivables as
of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Duke Energy is not aware of any
uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Management
believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance
carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.   

  For further
information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments
and Contingencies.    

Accounting
for Income Taxes    

Significant management
judgment is required in determining Duke Energy s provision for income taxes,
deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded
against Duke Energy s net deferred tax assets, if any.   

  Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The probability of
realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income
and the use of tax planning that could impact the ability to realize deferred
tax assets. If future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain, a
valuation allowance may be recorded against certain deferred tax assets.   

  In assessing the
likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers
estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Actual income
taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the impacts of various items,
including changes to income tax laws, Duke Energy s forecasted financial
condition and results of operations in future periods, as well as results of
audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. Although
management believes current estimates are reasonable, actual results could
differ from these estimates.   

  Significant judgment
is also required in computing Duke Energy s quarterly effective tax rate (ETR).
The ETR calculations are revised each quarter based on the best annual tax
assumptions available at that time, including, but not limited to, income
levels, deductions and credits. In accordance with interim tax reporting rules,
a tax expense or benefit is recorded every quarter to adjust for the difference
in tax expense computed based on the actual year-to-date ETR versus the
forecasted annual ETR, excluding discrete items impacting income tax expense
that have occurred year-to-date.   

  Duke Energy recognizes
tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns,
including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return,
when a more-likely-than-not threshold is met for a tax position and management
believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities. Duke Energy records the largest amount of the tax benefit that is
greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Management evaluates
each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances
of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority
having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant management
judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount
of tax benefits to be recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management
reevaluates tax positions when new information about recognition or measurement
becomes available. The portion of the tax benefit which is uncertain is
disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   

  Undistributed foreign
earnings associated with International Energy s operations are considered
indefinitely reinvested. As a result, no U.S. tax is recorded on such earnings.
This assertion is based on management s determination that the cash held in
International Energy s foreign jurisdictions is not needed to fund the
operations of its U.S. operations and that International Energy either has
invested or has intentions to reinvest such earnings. While management
currently intends to indefinitely reinvest all of International Energy s unremitted
earnings, should circumstances change, Duke Energy may need to record
additional income tax expense in the period in which such determination
changes. The cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2012, on
which Duke Energy has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes is approximately $2.0 billion. The amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is estimated at
between $275 million and $350 million.   

  For further information,
see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Income Taxes.    

Pension
and Other Post-Retirement Benefits    

The calculation of
pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and pension and other
post-retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions. Changes in these
assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts, and
future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes
that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement
benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the
assumed discount rate. Additionally, medical and prescription drug cost trend
rate assumptions are critical to Duke Energy s estimates of other
post-retirement benefits.   

  Funding requirements
for defined benefit plans are determined by government regulations. Duke Energy
made voluntary contributions to its defined benefit retirement plans of $200
million in 2012, $200 million in 2011, and $400 million in 2010 and mandatory
contributions of $104 million in 2012. In 2013, Duke Energy anticipates making
$350 million of contributions to its defined benefit plans.   

  Duke Energy and its
subsidiaries, including Progress Energy and Cinergy, maintain, and the
Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-contributory defined benefit
retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S. employees using a cash balance
formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a
retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage
(which may vary with age and years of service) of current eligible earnings and
current interest credits. Certain Progress Energy and Cinergy U.S. employees
are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula. Under the Cinergy
final average earnings formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement
benefit equal to a percentage of their highest 3-year average earnings, plus a
percentage of their highest 3-year average earnings in excess of covered
compensation per year of participation (maximum of 35 years), plus a percentage
of their highest 3-year average earnings times years of participation in excess
of 35 years. Under the Progress Energy final average earnings formula, a plan
participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their
highest 4-year average earnings, plus a percentage of their highest 4-year
average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation
(maximum of 35 years), plus a percentage of their highest 4-year average
earnings times years of participation in excess of 35 years. Duke Energy also
maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-qualified,
non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain
executives.

PART II   

Duke
Energy and most of its subsidiaries provide, and the Subsidiary Registrants
participate in, some health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Certain employees are
eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at
retirement, as defined in the plans.   

  Duke Energy recognized
pre-tax qualified pension cost of $117 million in 2012. In 2013, Duke Energy s
pre-tax qualified pension cost is expected to be $61 million higher than in
2012 resulting primarily from a 2013 decrease in the discount rate on
obligations and  expected long-term rate of return on assets, and 12 months of
expense recognition in 2013 for the Progress Energy plans. Duke Energy
recognized pre-tax nonqualified pension cost of $19 million and pre-tax other
post-retirement benefits cost of $80 million, in 2012. In 2013, pre-tax
non-qualified pension cost is expected to be approximately the same amount as
in 2012. In 2013, pre-tax other post-retirement benefits costs are expected to
be approximately $46 million higher than in 2012 resulting primarily from  12
months of expense recognition in 2013 for the Progress Energy plans.   

  For both pension and
other post-retirement plans, Duke Energy assumes that its plan s assets will
generate a long-term rate of return of 7.75% as of December 31, 2012. The
assets for Duke Energy s pension and other post-retirement plans are maintained
in two master trusts, the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust and the Progress
Energy Master Trust. The investment objective of the master trusts is to
achieve reasonable returns on trust assets, subject to a prudent level of
portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan
participants. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the
investment objective and the risk profile. U.S. equities are held for their
high expected return. Non-U.S. equities, debt securities, hedge funds, real
estate and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments
within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market
participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments. Duke
Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically
rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered
appropriate. Duke Energy also invests other post-retirement assets in the Duke
Energy Corporation Employee Benefits Trust (VEBA I). The investment objective
of VEBA I is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of
portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for
participants. VEBA I is passively managed.   

  The expected long-term
rate of return of 7.75% for the plan s assets was developed using a weighted
average calculation of expected returns for the master trusts based primarily
on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active
asset managers. The weighted average returns expected by asset classes for the
Duke Energy Retirement Master Trust were 2.53% for U.S. equities, 1.46% for
Non-U.S. equities, 0.97% for global equities, 1.65% for debt securities, 0.36%
for global private equity, 0.22% for hedge funds, 0.28% for real estate and
0.28% for other global securities. The weighted average returns expected by asset
classes for the Progress Energy Master Trust were 1.83% for U.S. equities,
1.41% for Non-U.S. equities, 0.78% for global equities, 1.67% for debt
securities, 1.20% for global private equity, 0.57% for hedge funds, 0.08% for
real estate and 0.21% for other global securities  

  Duke Energy discounted
its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of
4.1% as of December 31, 2012. The discount rates used to measure benefit plan
benefit obligations for financial reporting purposes should reflect rates at
which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2012,
Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other
post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio
approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of
high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for
the projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is
derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or
higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is
determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit
payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.   

  Future changes in plan
asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the
participants in Duke Energy s pension and post-retirement plans will impact
Duke Energy s future pension expense and liabilities. Management cannot predict
with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following table
presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy s 2012 pre-tax pension expense,
pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25%
change in rates were to occur.  

Duke
Energy s U.S. post-retirement plan uses a medical care trend rate which
reflects the near and long-term expectation of increases in medical health care
costs. Duke Energy s U.S. post-retirement plan uses a prescription drug trend
rate which reflects the near and long-term expectation of increases in
prescription drug health care costs. As of December 31, 2012, the medical care
trend rates were 8.5%, which grades to 5.00% by 2020. The following table
presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy s 2012 pre-tax other
post-retirement expense and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 1%
point change in the health care trend rate were to occur.

PART II   

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES    

Overview    

At December 31, 2012,
Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.8
billion, of which $1.1 billion is held in foreign jurisdictions and is
forecasted to be used to fund the operations of and investments in
International Energy. To fund its domestic liquidity and capital requirements,
Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, borrowings, and
its existing cash and cash equivalents. The relatively stable operating cash flows
of USFE G compose a substantial portion of Duke Energy s cash flows from
operations and it is anticipated that it will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future. A material adverse change in operations, or in available
financing, could impact Duke Energy s ability to fund its current liquidity and
capital resource requirements. Weather conditions, commodity price fluctuations
and unanticipated expenses, including unplanned plant outages and storms, could
affect the timing and level of internally generated funds.   

  Ultimate cash flows
from operations are subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited
to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A.
 Risk Factors  for details).   

  Duke Energy s
projected capital and investment expenditures for the next three fiscal years
are included in the table below.  

Duke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning
  its business for future success and will invest principally in its   

strongest business sectors. Based on this goal, the majority of
  Duke Energy s total projected capital expenditures are allocated to the  

USFE G segment. The table below includes the components of
  projected capital expenditures for USFE G for the next three fiscal
  years.

With
respect to the 2013 capital expenditure plan, Duke Energy has flexibility
within its $6.3 billion budget to defer or eliminate certain spending should
economic or financing conditions deteriorate. Of the $6.3 billion budget, $1.3 billion
relates to projects for which management has committed capital, including, but
not limited to, the final construction of the Edwardsport IGCC plant and the Sutton
combined cycle gas-fired facility, and management intends to spend those
capital dollars in 2013 irrespective of broader economic factors. $4.6 billion
of projected 2013 capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for
overall system maintenance and upgrades, customer connections, compliance with
new environmental requirements and corporate capital expenditures. Although
these expenditures are ultimately necessary to ensure overall system
maintenance and reliability, the timing of the expenditures may be influenced
by broad economic conditions and customer growth, thus management has more
flexibility in terms of when these dollars are actually spent. The remaining
planned 2013 capital expenditures of $0.4 billion are of a discretionary nature
and relate to growth opportunities in which Duke Energy may invest, provided
there are opportunities that meet return expectations.   

  As a
result of Duke Energy s significant commitment to modernize its generating
fleet through the construction of new units, the ability to cost effectively
manage the construction phase of current and future projects is critical to
ensuring full and timely recovery of costs of construction. Should Duke Energy
encounter significant cost overruns above amounts approved by the various state
commissions, and those amounts are disallowed for recovery in rates, or if
construction costs of renewable generation exceed amounts provided through
power sales agreements and tax credits, future cash flows and results of
operations could be adversely impacted.   

  Duke
Energy s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the
table below.   

Duke
Energy s fixed charges coverage ratio, calculated using SEC guidelines, was 2.5
times for 2012, 3.2 times for 2011, and 3.0 times for 2010.   

  In 2013,
Duke Energy currently anticipates issuing additional debt of $4.3 billion,
primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities.
Due to the flexibility in the timing of projected 2013 capital expenditures,
the timing and amount of debt issuances throughout 2013 could be influenced by
changes in capital spending.   

  Duke
Energy has access to a $6 billion master credit facility, which is not
restricted upon general market conditions. At December 31, 2012, Duke Energy
has available borrowing capacity of $4.9 billion under this facility.
Management currently believes that amounts available under its revolving master
credit facility are accessible should there be a need to generate additional
short-term financing in 2013. Management expects that cash flows from
operations and issuances of debt will be sufficient to cover the 2013 funding
requirements related to capital and investments expenditures, dividend payments
and debt maturities. See  Credit Facilities  section below for additional
information regarding Duke Energy s credit facility.   

  Duke
Energy monitors compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions and does
not currently believe it will be in violation or breach of its significant debt
covenants during 2013. However, circumstances could arise that may alter that
view. If and when management had a belief that such      

65   

PART II   

potential
breach could exist, appropriate action would be taken to mitigate any such
issue. Duke Energy also maintains an active dialogue with the credit rating
agencies.   

  Duke
Energy periodically evaluates the impact of repatriation of cash generated and
held in foreign countries. Duke Energy s current intent is to indefinitely
reinvest foreign earnings. However, circumstances could arise that may alter
that view, including a future change in tax law governing U.S. taxation of
foreign earnings. If Duke Energy were to decide to repatriate foreign generated
and held cash, recognition of material U.S. federal income tax liabilities
could be required.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 as
  compared to 2011 was driven primarily by:   

An approximately $1,210 million increase in net income after
  non-cash adjustments (depreciation and amortizations, higher Edwardsport
  charges, severance expense and other Progress Energy merger related costs),
  resulting from the inclusion of Progress Energy's results beginning July 2,
  2012 and the impact of the 2011 North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases,
  net of unfavorable weather; and   

A $560 million increase in traditional working capital, mainly
  due to an increase in current year vacation and incentive accruals and prior
  year refund of North Carolina overcollected fuels costs and current year
  overcollection of North Carolina and South Carolina fuel costs, partially
  offset by;  

A $100 million increase in contributions to company sponsored
  pension plans due to contributions for Progress Energy pension plans.  

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 as
  compared to 2010 was driven primarily by:   

Changes in traditional working capital amounts principally due
  to a increase in coal inventory, resulting mainly from milder weather and
  changes in the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
  partially offset by;   

A $200 million decrease in contributions to company sponsored
  pension plans due to 2010 pre-funding of contributions resulting from
  favorable borrowing conditions.

The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2012 as
  compared to 2011 is primarily due to the following:   

A $1,490 million increase in capital, investment and acquisition
  expenditures primarily due to the inclusion of Progress Energy's capital
  expenditures beginning July 2, 2012, higher expenditures on renewable energy
  projects and the Chilean hydro acquisition, net of lower spending on Duke
  Energy's ongoing infrastructure modernization program as these projects near
  completion and  

A $440 million increase in restricted cash primarily due to a
  secured debt issuance related to Chilean hydro acquisition.   

The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2011 as
  compared to 2010 is primarily due to the following:   

A $290 million decrease in proceeds from sales of equity
  investments and other assets, and sales of and collections on notes
  receivable as result of cash received in 2010 from the sale of a 50% interest
  in DukeNet and the sale of Duke Energy s 30% interest in Q-Comm, partially
  offset by the 2011 sale of Windstream stock received in conjunction with the
  Q-Comm sale in December 2010 and  

A $230 million increase in purchases of available-for-sale
  securities, net of proceeds, due to the investment of excess cash held in
  foreign jurisdictions.   

These increases in cash used were partially offset by the
  following:  

A $390 million decrease in capital, investment and acquisition
  expenditures primarily due to construction of the Edwardsport IGCC plant and
  Cliffside Unit 6 nearing completion.

The decrease in net cash
  provided by financing activities in 2012 as compared to 2011 was due
  primarily to the following:  

A $620 million decrease
  in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to the timing of issuances
  and redemptions between years and  

A $420 million increase
  in quarterly dividends primarily due to an increase in common shares
  outstanding, resulting from the merger with Progress Energy and an increase
  in dividends per share from $0.75 to $0.765 in the third quarter of 2012. The
  total annual dividend per share was $3.03 in 2012 compared to $2.97 in 2011;  

These decreases in cash
  provided were partially offset by:  

A $70 million increase in
  proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper, primarily
  due to the PremierNotes program, net of paydown of commercial paper.  

The increase in net cash
  provided by financing activities in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due
  primarily to the following:  

A $1,200 million net
  increase in long-term debt primarily due to financings associated with the
  ongoing fleet modernization program and   

A $260 million increase
  in proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper,
  primarily due to PremierNotes and commercial paper issuances.  

These increases in cash
  provided were partially offset by:  

A $240 million decrease
  in proceeds from the issuances of common stock primarily related to the
  Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) and other internal plans, due to the
  discontinuance of new share issuances in the first quarter of 2011 and   

A $50 million increase in
  dividends paid in 2011 due to an increase in dividends per share from $0.735
  to $0.75 in the third quarter of 2011. The total annual dividend per share
  was $2.97 in 2011 compared to $2.91 in 2010.  

Significant
Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt Activities   2012 - 2013.   

  Duke Energy s
outstanding long-term debt, including current maturities as of December 31,
2012, includes approximately $17.8 billion assumed in the merger with Progress
Energy. This amount includes $2.3 billion of fair value adjustments recorded in
connection with purchase accounting for the Progress Energy merger, which are
not part of future principal payments and will amortize over the remaining life
of the debt. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Acquisitions,
Dispositions and Sales of Other Assets  for additional information related to
the merger with Progress Energy.  

  On February 6, 2013,
Duke Energy announced that it will redeem all shares of the three and five series
of preferred stock issued by Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy
Florida, respectively, of $93 million on March 8, 2013.  

   In January 2013, Duke
Energy issued $500 million of unsecured junior subordinated debentures, which
carry a fixed interest rate of 5.125%, are callable at par after five years and
mature January 15, 2073. Proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem at par
$300 million of 7.10% junior subordinated debt in February 2013, with the
remainder to repay a portion of commercial paper as it matures, to fund capital
expenditures of our unregulated businesses and for general corporate purposes.  

  In
December 2012, Duke Energy entered credit agreements with a commercial bank for
a $190 million bridge loan and a $200 million revolving loan. The bridge loan
carries a variable interest rate equal to the 180-day Libor rate plus 0.80% and
matures on June 20, 2013. The revolving loan carries a variable interest rate
equal to the 360-day Libor rate plus 1.35% and is payable in full on December
20, 2013; Duke Energy has the right to extend the term of the revolving loan
for an additional 1-year terms, not to exceed a final maturity of 13 years from
the date of the initial funding. Both loans are collateralized with cash
deposits equal to 101% of the loan amounts, and therefore no net proceeds from
the financings exist as of December 31, 2012.     

  In December 2012, Los
Vientos Windpower IA, LLC (Los Vientos 1A) and Los Vientos Windpower 1B, LLC
(Los Vientos 1B), subsidiaries of Duke Energy Generation Services, Inc. (DEGS)
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, each entered into long-term
loan agreements of $246 million and $177 million, respectively.  Of the
total loan amounts for Los Vientos 1A and Los Vientos 1B, $110 million for each
is at a fixed interest rate of      

67   

PART II   

4.740% that mature in
June, 2037 and June, 2036, respectively. The remainder of the Los Vientos 1A
and Los Vientos 1B loan amounts of $136 million and $67 million, respectively,
is at the six month adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an
applicable margin that was initially set at 2.774% for each loan. In connection
with the variable rate portion of the loans, Los Vientos 1A and Los Vientos 1B
entered into interest rate swaps to convert the substantial majority of the
variable rate loan interest payments from a variable rate to a fixed rate of
2.055% and 2.0175%, respectively, plus the applicable margin, which was 2.25%
as of December 31, 2012 for each loan and each of these loans is due to mature
June 30, 2030. The collateral for the loans are substantially all of the assets
of Los Vientos Windpower IA, LLC and Los Vientos Windpower 1B, LLC. Proceeds
from the issuances will be used to help fund the existing wind portfolio.   

  In November 2012,
Progress Energy Florida issued $650 million principal amount of first mortgage
bonds, of which $250 million carry a fixed interest rate of 0.65% and mature
November 15, 2015 and $400 million carry a fixed interest rate of 3.85% and
mature November 15, 2042. Proceeds from the issuances will be used to repay
$425 million 4.80% first mortgage bonds due March 1, 2013, as well as for
general corporate purposes.  

  In September 2012,
Duke Energy Carolinas issued $650 million principal amount of first mortgage
bonds, which carry a fixed interest rate of 4.00% and mature September 30,
2042.  Proceeds from the issuance were used to repay at maturity the $420
million debentures due through November 2012, as well as for general corporate
purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures.    

  In August 2012, Duke
Energy Corporation issued $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes, of which $700
million carry a fixed interest rate of 1.625% and mature August 15, 2017 and
$500 million carry a fixed interest rate of 3.05% and mature August 15, 2022.
Proceeds from the issuances were used to repay at maturity Duke Energy Ohio s
$500 million debentures due September 15, 2012 as well as for general corporate
purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper.    

  In April 2012, Duke
Energy executed a joint venture agreement with Sumitomo Corporation of America
(SCOA). Under the terms of the agreement, Duke Energy and SCOA each own a 50%
interest in the joint venture (DS Cornerstone, LLC), which owns two wind
generation projects. The facilities began commercial operations in June 2012
and August 2012. Duke Energy and SCOA also negotiated a $330 million,
Construction and 12-year amortizing Term Loan Facility, on behalf of the
borrower, a wholly owned subsidiary of the joint venture. The loan agreement is
non-recourse to Duke Energy. Duke Energy received proceeds of $319 million upon
execution of the loan agreement. This amount represents reimbursement of a
significant portion of Duke Energy s construction costs incurred as of the date
of the agreement. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Variable Interest Entities  for further information.  

  In March 2012, Duke
Energy Indiana issued $250 million principal amount of first mortgage bonds,
which carry a fixed interest rate of 4.20% and mature March 15, 2042. Proceeds
from the issuance were used to repay a portion of Duke Energy Indiana s
outstanding short-term debt.   

  In January 2012, Duke
Energy Carolinas used proceeds from its December 2011 $1 billion issuance of
principal amount of first mortgage bonds to repay $750 million 6.25% senior
unsecured notes that matured January 15, 2012.

1.75% and mature December 15, 2016 and $650 million carry a fixed interest rate
of 4.25% and mature December 15, 2041. Proceeds from the issuances were used to
repay $750 million 6.25% senior unsecured notes which matured January 15, 2012,
with the remainder to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate
purposes.  

  In
November 2011, Duke Energy issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, which
carry a fixed interest rate of 2.15% and mature November 15, 2016. Proceeds
from the issuance will be used to fund capital expenditures in Duke Energy s
unregulated businesses in the U.S. and for general corporate purposes.   

  In the
third quarter of 2011, Duke Energy issued an additional $450 million in
Commercial Paper. Proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate
purposes. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Duke Energy repaid $375 million of
Commercial Paper with the proceeds from the August 2011 Duke Energy debt
issuances discussed below.   

  In
August 2011, Duke Energy issued $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured
notes, which carry a fixed interest rate of 3.55% and mature September 15,
2021. Proceeds from the issuance were used to repay a portion of Duke Energy s
commercial paper, as discussed above, as it matures, to fund capital
expenditures in Duke Energy s unregulated businesses in the U.S. and for
general corporate purposes.   

  In May
2011, Duke Energy Carolinas issued $500 million principal amount of first
mortgage bonds, which carry a fixed interest rate of 3.90% and mature June 15,
2021. Proceeds from this issuance were used to fund capital expenditures and
for general corporate purposes.   

   Significant
Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt Activities   2010.    

  In
December 2010, Top of the World Wind Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of DEGS, an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, entered into a long-term loan
agreement for $193 million principal amount maturing in December 2028. The
collateral for this loan is substantially all of the assets of Top of the World
Windpower LLC. The initial interest rate on the notes is the six month adjusted
LIBOR plus an applicable margin. In connection with this debt issuance, DEGS
entered into an interest rate swap to convert the substantial majority of the
loan interest payments from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 3.465% plus the
applicable margin, which was 2.375% as of December 31, 2012. Proceeds from the
issuance will be used to help fund the existing wind portfolio.   

  In
September 2010, Duke Energy Carolinas converted $143 million of tax-exempt
variable-rate demand bonds to tax-exempt term bonds, which carry a fixed
interest rate of 4.375% and mature October 2031. Prior to the conversion, the
bonds were held by Duke Energy Carolinas as treasury bonds. In connection with
the conversion, the tax-exempt bonds were secured by a series of Duke Energy
Carolinas  first mortgage bonds.   

  In
September 2010, Duke Energy Carolinas converted $100 million of tax-exempt
variable-rate demand bonds, to tax-exempt term bonds, which carry a fixed
interest rate of 4.625% and mature November 1, 2040. In connection with the
conversion, the tax-exempt bonds were secured by a series of Duke Energy
Carolinas  first mortgage bonds.   

  In
September 2010, Duke Energy Indiana refunded $70 million of tax-exempt auction
rate bonds through the issuance of $70 million principal amount of tax-exempt

mature March 1, 2019, and $10 million carry a fixed interest rate of 3.75% and
mature April 1, 2022. In connection with the conversion, the tax-exempt bonds
were secured by a series of Duke Energy Indiana s first mortgage bonds.   

  In July
2010, Duke Energy Indiana issued $500 million principal amount of 3.75% first
mortgage bonds due July 15, 2020. Proceeds from the issuance were used to repay
$123 million of borrowings under the Master Credit Facility, to fund Duke
Energy Indiana s ongoing capital expenditures and for general corporate
purposes.

PART II   

In
July 2010, International Energy issued $281 million principal amount in Brazil,
which carries an interest rate of 8.59% plus IGP-M (Brazil s monthly inflation
index) non-convertible debentures due July 2015. Proceeds of the issuance were
used to refinance Brazil debt related to DEIGP and for future debt maturities
in Brazil.   

  In June
2010, Duke Energy Carolinas issued $450 million principal amount of 4.30% first
mortgage bonds due June 15, 2020. Proceeds from the issuance were used to fund
Duke Energy Carolinas  ongoing capital expenditures and for general corporate
purposes.   

  In May
2010, Green Frontier Wind Power, LLC, a subsidiary of DEGS, an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Duke Energy, entered into a long-term loan agreement for $325
million principal amount maturing in 2025. The collateral for this loan is a
group of five wind farms located in Wyoming, Colorado and Pennsylvania. The
initial interest rate on the notes is the six month adjusted LIBOR plus an
applicable margin. In connection with this debt issuance, DEGS entered into an
interest rate swap to convert the substantial majority of the loan interest
payments from a variable rate to a fixed rate of approximately 3.4% plus the
applicable margin, which was 2.5% as of December 30, 2012. Proceeds from the
issuance were used to help fund the existing wind portfolio.   

  In March
2010, Duke Energy issued $450 million principal amount of 3.35% senior unsecured
notes due April 1, 2015. Proceeds from the issuance were used to repay $274
million of borrowings under the master credit facility and for general
corporate purposes.   

Credit
Facilities    

Master
Credit Facility Summary.    In November 2011, Duke Energy entered into a $6 billion,
5-year master credit facility, expiring in November 2016, with $4 billion
available at closing and the remaining $2 billion available following
successful completion of the merger with Progress Energy. In October 2012, the
Duke Energy Registrants reached an agreement with banks representing $5.63
billion of commitments under the master credit facility to extend the
expiration date by one year to November 2017. Through November 2016, the
available credit under this facility remains $6 billion. The Duke Energy
Registrants each have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility up to
specified sublimits for each borrower. However, Duke Energy has the unilateral
ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each
borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. See the table below
for the borrowing sublimits for each of the borrowers as of December 31, 2012.
The amount available under the master credit facility is reduced by the use of
the master credit facility to backstop the issuances of commercial paper,
certain letters of credit and variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be
put to the Company at the option of the holder. Borrowing sublimits for the
Subsidiary Registrants are also reduced for amounts outstanding under the money
pool arrangement.
The credit facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total
capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower.  

In
January 2012, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky collectively entered
into a $156 million 2-year bilateral letter of credit agreement, under which
Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky may request the issuance of
letters of credit up to $129 million and $27 million, respectively, on their
behalf to support various series of variable-rate demand bonds. In addition,
Duke Energy Indiana entered into a $78 million 2-year bilateral letter of
credit facility. These credit facilities may not be used for any purpose other
than to support the variable rate demand bonds issued by Duke Energy Indiana
and Duke Energy Kentucky. In February 2012, letters of credit were issued
corresponding to the amount of the facilities to support various series of
tax-exempt bonds at Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky. In February
2013, the letters of credit were amended to extend the expiration date to January
2015.  

  Duke
Energy s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other
covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods
could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As
of December 31, 2012, Duke Energy was in compliance with all covenants related
to its significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may
allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to
nonpayment, or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the
borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements
contain material adverse change clauses.   

    Credit
Ratings.     Duke
Energy and certain subsidiaries each hold credit ratings by Fitch Ratings (Fitch),
Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) and Standard   Poor s (S P). Duke
Energy s corporate credit rating and issuer credit rating from Fitch, Moody s
and S P, respectively, as of February 13, 2013 is BBB+, Baa2 and BBB,
respectively. As of February 13, 2013, the Duke Energy Registrants  have a
stable outlook rating from Fitch and Moody s, with the exception of Progress
Energy Florida, which has a negative outlook at Fitch. In addition, the Duke
Energy Registrants have a negative outlook rating from S P.

PART II   

Duke Energy s credit
ratings are dependent on, among other factors, the ability to generate
sufficient cash to fund capital and investment expenditures and pay dividends
on its common stock, while maintaining the strength of its current balance
sheet. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, Duke Energy is
unable to maintain its current balance sheet strength, or if its earnings and
cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, Duke Energy s credit ratings could
be negatively impacted.   

    Credit-Related Clauses     .           Duke Energy may be
required to repay certain debt should the credit ratings at Duke Energy
Carolinas fall to a certain level at S P or Moody s. As of December 31,
2012, Duke Energy had $9 million of senior unsecured notes which mature
serially through 2016 that may be required to be repaid if Duke Energy
Carolinas  senior unsecured debt ratings fall below BBB at S P or Baa2 at
Moody s.   

    First Mortgage Bond
Restrictions.    
The Subsidiary Registrants  first mortgage bonds are secured under their
respective mortgage indentures. Each mortgage constitutes a first lien on
substantially all of the fixed properties of the respective company, subject to
certain permitted encumbrances and exceptions. The lien of each mortgage also
covers subsequently acquired property. Each mortgage allows the issuance of
additional first mortgage bonds based on property additions, retirements of
first mortgage bonds and the deposit of cash if certain conditions are
satisfied. Most of the Subsidiary Registrants are required to pass a  net
earnings  test in order to issue new first mortgage bonds, other than on the
basis of retired bonds under certain circumstances. The test requires that the
issuer s adjusted net earnings, which is calculated based on results for 12
consecutive months within the prior 15 to 18 months, be at least twice the
annual interest requirement for bonds currently outstanding and to be
outstanding. Duke Energy Indiana s and Progress Energy Florida s ratios of net
earnings to the annual interest requirement for bonds have at times in 2012
been below 2.0 times, due to various charges to operating expenses. As
discussed in Note 4, Regulatory Matters, these charges and any future charges
may impact future net earnings tests and affect the ability of Duke Energy
Indiana and Progress Energy Florida to issue first mortgage bonds. In the event
Duke Energy Indiana s or Progress Energy Florida s long-term debt requirements
exceed its first mortgage bond capacity, Duke Energy Indiana or Progress Energy
Florida can access alternative sources of capital, including, but not limited
to issuing unsecured debt, borrowing under the money pool, entering into
bilateral direct loan arrangements, and, if necessary, utilizing available
capacity under the master credit facility. All other DEC registrants have
earnings substantially in excess of the net earnings test requirement for
issuing first mortgage bonds.  

    Other Financing
Matters.     The
following table shows significant amounts presented as Current maturities of
long-term debt on the Duke Energy Registrants respective Consolidated Balance Sheets
as of December 31, 2012. The amounts were presented as Long-term debt as of
December 31, 2011, except for the secured debt. The Duke Energy Registrants 
currently anticipates satisfying these obligations with proceeds from additional
borrowings, unless otherwise noted.  

On November 13, 2012,
Duke Energy filed a prospectus supplement to the September 2010 Form S-3 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to sell up to $1 billion of fixed
or variable rate unsecured senior notes, called InterNotes, due one year to 30
years from the date of issuance. The InterNotes will be issued in the retail
markets as direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Duke Energy
Corporation. The net proceeds from the sale of InterNotes will be used to fund
capital expenditures in Duke Energy s unregulated businesses and for general
corporate purposes. The balance as of December 31, 2012 is $35 million, with
maturities ranging from 10 to14 years. The notes reflect long-term debt
obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Long-term debt on Duke Energy s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  On March 1, 2012,
Progress Energy, as a well-known seasoned issuer, Progress Energy Carolinas and
Progress Energy Florida filed a combined shelf registration statement with the
SEC, which became effective upon filing with the SEC. The registration
statement is effective for three years and does not limit the amount or number
of various securities that can be issued. On July 3, 2012, Progress Energy
deregistered its equity securities from the registration statement in
connection with the merger with Progress Energy, but retained its ability to
issue senior debt securities and junior subordinated debentures under the
registration statement. However, we do not expect Progress Energy to issue any
new securities of these types in the      

70   

PART II   

future. Under
Progress Energy Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s registration
statements, they may issue various long-term debt securities and preferred
stock.   

  On April 4, 2011,
Duke Energy filed a registration statement (Form S-3) with the SEC to sell up
to $1 billion (maximum of $500 million of notes outstanding at any particular
time) of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called PremierNotes.
The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating
rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its
designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an
investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes
have no stated maturity date, but may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke
Energy at any time. The notes are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole
or in part at the investor s option. Proceeds from the sale of the notes will
be used for general corporate purposes. The balance as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, is $395 million and $79 million, respectively. The notes
reflect a short-term debt obligation of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes
Payable and Commercial Paper on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  In September 2010,
Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is
uncapped, Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy
Indiana may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices
and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The
registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by Duke
Energy.   

  Duke Energy has paid
quarterly cash dividends for 87 consecutive years and expects to continue its
policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as
to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings,
capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of
the Board of Directors.   

    Dividend and Other
Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries.         As discussed in Note 4
to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Regulatory Matters , Duke Energy s
wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount
of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy via dividend, advance or loan
as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with
Duke Energy s mergers with Cinergy and Progress Energy. Progress Energy
Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their
first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation which, in certain
circumstances, limited their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on
common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other
restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth
requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of
funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2012, the amount
of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may
not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend is $10.3
billion. However, Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on
paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity
accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various
operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe
these restrictions will have any significant impact on Duke Energy s ability to
access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future
funding obligations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

Duke
Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the
normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third
parties. These arrangements include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of
credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.   

  Most of
the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit
standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly
owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee
arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not
included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy,
either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital)
through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the spin-off of
Spectra Energy Corp (Spectra Energy), having to honor its contingencies is
largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and
other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.   

  Duke
Energy performs ongoing assessments of their respective guarantee obligations
to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of
potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy
has issued guarantees.  

  See Note
7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Guarantees and Indemnifications, 
for further details of the guarantee arrangements.   

  Issuance
of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke
Energy s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these
guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows or financial position.   

  Other
than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease
arrangements, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet
financing entities or structures. For additional information on these
commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments
and Contingencies.

  interest component of capital leases based on the interest rates stated in
  the lease agreements and exclude certain related executory costs.  

(d)  

Current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term
  debt, and purchase obligations reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
  have been excluded from the above table.  

(e)  

Includes contractual obligations to purchase physical quantities
  of electricity, coal, nuclear fuel and limestone, including a total of $195
  million for nuclear fuel contractual obligations related to Crystal River
  Unit 3. Also includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with
  uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural
  gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts
  that qualify as normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS). For contracts where the
  price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at
  December 31, 2012. For certain of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a
  net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting
  arrangements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset
  receivables and payables with such counterparties.  

(f)  

Includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting
  or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for
  engineering, procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and
  nuclear plant refurbishments, environmental projects on fossil facilities,
  major maintenance of certain nonregulated plants, maintenance and day to day
  contract work at certain wind facilities and commitments to buy wind and
  combustion turbines (CT). Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for
  services that are provided on demand, for which the timing of the purchase
  cannot be determined and Progress Energy Florida's engineering, procurement
  and construction agreement for Levy. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
  Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies  for further discussion
  of the Levy engineering, procurement and construction agreement.  

(g)  

Uncertain tax positions of $540 million are not reflected in
  this table as Duke Energy cannot predict when open income tax years will
  close with completed examinations. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial
  Statements,  Income Taxes.   

(h)  

Related to future annual funding obligations to nuclear
  decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) through nuclear power stations'
  re-licensing dates. Amounts through 2017 include $13 million per year for
  North Carolina jurisdictional amounts that Progress Energy Carolinas retained
  internally and is transitioning to its external decommissioning funds per a
  2008 NCUC order. The transition of the original $131 million must be complete
  by December 31, 2017, and at least 10 percent must be transitioned each year.
  See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement
  Obligations.   

(i)  

The table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental
  remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance
  claims (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and
  Contingencies ) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing of when
  cash payments will be required. Additionally, the table above excludes annual
  insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including
  nuclear insurance (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
   Commitments and Contingencies ), funding of pension and other
  post-retirement benefit plans (see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial
  Statements,  Employee Benefit Plans ), asset retirement obligations
  (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement
  Obligations ) and regulatory liabilities (see Note 4 to the Consolidated
  Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters ) because the amount and timing of
  the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are Deferred Income Taxes and
  Investment Tax Credits recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since cash
  payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income
  for each discrete fiscal year.

PART II   

QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Risk Management
Policies.     
   The
Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to market risks associated with commodity
prices, credit quality, interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency
exchange rates. Management has established comprehensive risk management
policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall
approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and
authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of
Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other
members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures, credit
exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is
responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity
price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.   

  The following
disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve
estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those
expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please review Item 1A,  Risk
Factors,  and  Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements  for a discussion of
the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.  

  The risks discussed
below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument
transactions and positions associated with the Duke Energy Registrants 
operations, such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory.   

Commodity
Price Risk   

The Duke Energy
Registrants are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of
electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and
purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets. The Duke
Energy Registrants  exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost-based
regulation of its U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas operations as these
regulated operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of
these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses.
While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and
when these costs are recovered through rates, changes from year to year
generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated
operations. At December 31, 2012, substantially all derivative commodity
instrument positions were subject to regulatory accounting treatment.   

  Price risk represents
the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of
electricity or other energy commodities. The Duke Energy Registrants  exposure
to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including
contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific
contract terms. The Duke Energy Registrants employ established policies and
procedures to manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations, which
may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures,
forwards and options. For additional information, see Note     15  to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Risk Management, Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.    

73   

PART II   

Validation
of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from the
Duke Energy Registrants  deal origination areas. While the Duke Energy
Registrants use common industry practices to develop their valuation
techniques, changes in their pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions
could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition.   

    Hedging Strategies.      The Duke Energy
Registrants closely monitor the risks associated with commodity price changes
on their future operations and, where appropriate, use various commodity
instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts to
mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations, in addition to
optimizing the value of the non-regulated generation portfolio. Duke Energy s
primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation
portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel.   

  The majority of instruments
used to manage the Duke Energy Registrants  commodity price exposure are either
not designated as a hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These
instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes
for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected
as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are
marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative
instruments reflected in earnings.   

  Certain derivatives
used to manage the Duke Energy Registrants  commodity price exposure are
accounted for as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. To the extent
that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the
transaction being hedged, there is no impact to the Consolidated Statements of
Operations until after delivery or settlement occurs. Accordingly, assumptions
and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported
earnings prior to settlement to the extent they are effective. Several factors
influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract, including the use of contracts
with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk.
Hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured at least quarterly.   

  In addition to the
hedge contracts described above and recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into other contracts that qualify for
the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as an NPNS, the
Duke Energy registrants apply such exception. Income recognition and
realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical
delivery of power. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no
recognition of the contract s fair value in the Consolidated Financial
Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the
transaction remains probable of occurring.   

    Generation Portfolio
Risks.     
The Duke Energy Registrants are primarily exposed to market price fluctuations
of wholesale power, natural gas, and coal prices in the U.S. Franchised
Electric and Gas and Commercial Power segments. The Duke Energy Registrants
optimize the value of their       wholesale and non-regulated generation
portfolios. The portfolios include generation assets (power and capacity),
fuel, and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output,
fuel requirements, and emission allowance requirements are based on forward
power, fuel and emission allowance markets. The component pieces of the
portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in
order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the
strategies of the business units. For Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy
Indiana, as well as the Kentucky regulated generation owned by Duke Energy Ohio,
the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed
load is subject to commodity price fluctuations, although the impact on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in
these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from
these activities with retail customers. Duke Energy Ohio is subject to
wholesale commodity price risks for its non-regulated generation portfolio. The
non-regulated generation portfolio dispatches all of their electricity into
unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues
from PJM. Duke Energy Ohio has fully hedged its forecasted coal-fired
generation for 2013. Capacity revenues are 100% contracted in PJM through May   
   2015. International Energy generally hedges its expected generation using
long-term bilateral power sales contracts when favorable market conditions
exist and it is subject to wholesale commodity price risks for electricity not
sold under such contracts. International Energy dispatches electricity not sold
under long-term bilateral contracts into unregulated markets and receives
wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from       national system
operators. Derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks
for delivery periods beyond 2013 are also       exposed to changes in fair
value due to market price fluctuations of       wholesale power, fuel oil  and
coal. See  Sensitivity Analysis for Generation Portfolio and Derivative Price
Risks  below, for more information regarding the effect of changes in commodity
prices on the Duke Energy Registrants  net income.   

    Other Commodity Risks.      At December 31,
2012, pre-tax income in 2013  was not expected to be materially impacted for
exposures to other commodities  price changes.   

    Sensitivity Analysis
for Generation Portfolio and Derivative Price Risks.      The table below
summarizes the estimated effect of commodity price changes on the Duke Energy
Registrants  pre-tax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as
of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 for Duke Energy and Duke
Energy Ohio. Forecasted exposure to commodity price risk for Duke Energy
Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida and Duke Energy
Indiana is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on their consolidated
results of operations in 2013, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of
December 31, 2012. The sensitivity analysis performed as of
December 31, 2011 related to forecasted exposure to commodity price risk
during 2012 also indicated that commodity price risk would not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations of Duke Energy
Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida and Duke Energy
Indiana during 2012 and the impacts of changing commodity prices in their
consolidated results of operations for 2012 was insignificant. The following
commodity price sensitivity calculations consider existing hedge positions and
estimated production levels, as indicated in the table below, but do not
consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in
commodity prices.

PART II   

Credit
Risk    

Credit risk represents
the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails
to perform under its contractual obligations. To reduce credit exposure, the
Duke Energy Registrants seek to enter into netting agreements with
counterparties that permit them to offset receivables and payables with such
counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants attempt to further reduce credit
risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable
obtaining collateral or terminating or resetting the terms of transactions
after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit-related events.
The Duke Energy Registrants may, at times, use credit derivatives or other
structures and techniques to provide for third-party credit enhancement of
their counterparties  obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash
or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of
collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the
customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to
each transaction. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Risk
Management, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,  for additional
information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.   

  The Duke Energy
Registrants  industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines
for physical delivery contracts. The Duke Energy Registrants frequently use
master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures. The
collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of
credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold.
The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each
party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy
Registrants  internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral
agreements generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is
sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions.   

  The Duke Energy
Registrants  principal customers for its electric and gas businesses are
commodity clearinghouses, regional transmission organizations, industrial,
commercial and residential end-users, marketers, distribution companies,
municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S.
and Latin America. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of
receivables from such entities throughout these regions. These concentrations
of customers may affect the Duke Energy Registrants  overall credit risk in
that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire
sector. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the
counterparties  financial condition prior to entering into an agreement,
establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an
ongoing basis.   

  Duke Energy Carolinas has
a third-party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to its asbestos-related
injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of $476 million.
Duke Energy Carolinas  cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance
retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of 2008. Future
payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third party insurance
carrier. The insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries
for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is $935 million in excess
of the self insured retention. Insurance recoveries of $781 million and $813
million related to this policy are classified in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets in Other within Investments and Other Assets and Receivables as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Duke Energy Carolinas is not
aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims.
Management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the
insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.   

  The Duke Energy
Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance
guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned
entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these
guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these
guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to
perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to
assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to
secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations
under the guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Guarantees and Indemnifications,  for further information on guarantees issued
by the Duke Energy Registrants.   

  The Duke Energy
Registrants are also subject to credit risk of their vendors and suppliers in
the form of performance risk on contracts including, but not limited to,
outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and commodity purchases.
The Duke Energy Registrants  credit exposure to such vendors and suppliers may
take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of
non-performance.   

  Credit risk associated
with the Duke Energy Registrants  service to residential, commercial and
industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable.
The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring customers to
provide a cash deposit or letter of credit until a satisfactory payment history
is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail
jurisdiction, at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for
retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the
Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through the retail rates.
Management continually monitors customer charge-offs and payment patterns to
ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy
Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections
through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated variable interest entity. Losses on
collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated
retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke
Energy Indiana. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Variable
Interest Entities.    

  Based on the Duke
Energy Registrants  policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and
their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently
anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position
or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.   

    European Exposures.      At December 31, 2012,
Duke Energy held $62 million of money market funds and short term investments
in investment-grade debt securities issued by financial and nonfinancial
institutions that are domiciled in Europe or have exposures to European
sovereign debt. This amount is recorded at fair value and included in Cash and
cash equivalents and Short-term investment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A
disorderly default by or withdrawal of a member nation from the euro zone and
financial stress in other European countries could require Duke Energy to
recognize an impairment of some or all of these securities.        

75   

PART II   

Interest Rate Risk    

The Duke Energy Registrants
are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of
their issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Duke
Energy Registrants manage interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate
exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects
of market changes in interest rates. The Duke Energy Registrants also enter
into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as,
but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock
agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 6, 15,
and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies,   Debt and Credit Facilities,   Risk Management,
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,  and  Fair Value of Financial
Assets and Liabilities.    

  The table below
summarizes the potential effect of interest rate changes on the Duke Energy
Registrants  pre-tax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as
of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  

These amounts were
estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on
variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges,
short-term and long-term investments, cash and cash equivalents outstanding as
of December 31, 2012 and 2011. The change in interest rate sensitivity for
the Duke Energy Registrants  is primarily due to changes in short-term debt
balances and cash balances. If interest rates changed significantly, management
would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change. However, due to
the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the Duke Energy
Registrants  financial structure.   

Marketable
Securities Price Risk    

As described further
in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities,  Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part
of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations of the business.
The vast majority of the investments in equity securities are within the NDTF
and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.   

    Pension
Plan Assets.     Duke
Energy and Progress Energy maintain investments to help fund the costs of
providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement
benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity
markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these
pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce
the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy
and Progress Energy have established asset allocation targets for their pension
plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the
risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. These
target allocations are presented in the table below.

A significant decline
in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding
of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows
of the Duke Energy Registrants in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the
fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan,
could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future
periods, which could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants  results of
operations in those periods.   Contributions to qualified pension plans
during 2012 are presented in the table below.  

76   

PART II   

Duke Energy intends to
contribute $350 million to its qualified pension plan in 2013. See Note 23 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Employee Benefit Plans,  for additional
information on pension plan assets.   

    NDTF.         As required by the NRC,
NCUC, PSCSC and the FPSC, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas and
Progress Energy Florida maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear
decommissioning. As of December 31, 2012, these funds were invested primarily
in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, fixed-income
securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC,
NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities
related to nuclear decommissioning. The investments in equity securities are
exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. The Duke Energy Registrants
actively monitor their portfolios by benchmarking the performance of their
investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically
reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes. Accounting
for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through Duke Energy
Carolinas , Progress Energy Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s rates;
therefore, fluctuations in equity prices do not affect their Consolidated
Statements of Operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are
deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to an Order by
the NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact
the amount of costs recovered through Duke Energy Carolinas , Progress Energy
Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s rates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations  for additional information
regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements,  Investments in Debt and Equity Securities  for
additional information regarding NTDF assets.   

Foreign
Currency Risk    

Duke Energy is exposed
to foreign currency risk from investments in international businesses owned and
operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity-related transactions
within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies. To
mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be
denominated in or indexed to the U.S. Dollar/inflation rates and/or local
inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt
denominated or issued in the foreign currency. Duke Energy may also use foreign
currency derivatives, where possible, to manage its risk related to foreign
currency fluctuations. To monitor its currency exchange rate risks, Duke Energy
uses sensitivity analysis, which measures the impact of devaluation of the
foreign currencies to which it has exposure.   

  In 2012, Duke Energy s
primary foreign currency rate exposure was to the Brazilian Real. The table
below summarizes the potential effect of foreign currency devaluations on Duke
Energy s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets,
based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011.

are included in the table below.   

Global
Climate Change   

77   

PART II   

The
EPA publishes an inventory of man-made U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
annually. In 2010, the most recent year reported, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ),
a byproduct of all sources of combustion, accounted for approximately 84
percent of total U.S. GHG emissions. The Duke Energy Registrants  GHG emissions
consist primarily of CO 2  and most come from its fleet of coal-fired
power plants in the U.S. In 2012, the Duke Energy Registrants  U.S. power
plants emitted approximately 132 million tons of CO2. The CO2 emissions from
Duke Energy s international electric operations were approximately 3 million
tons. The Duke Energy Registrants  future CO2 emissions will be influenced by
variables including new regulations, economic conditions that affect
electricity demand, and the Duke Energy Registrants  decisions regarding
generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants believe it is unlikely that legislation mandating reductions in GHG
emissions or establishing a carbon tax will be passed by the 113th Congress
which began on January 3, 2013. Beyond 2014 the prospects for enactment of any
federal legislation mandating reductions in GHG emissions or establishing a
carbon tax is highly uncertain. Given the high degree of uncertainty
surrounding potential future federal GHG legislation, management cannot predict
if or when such legislation might be enacted, what the requirements of any
potential legislation might be, or the potential impact it might have on the
Duke Energy Registrants. Among the outcomes of the 18th Conference of the
Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which
concluded in December 2012 was an affirmation by the participating countries to
complete negotiations on a new global agreement by 2015 that would take effect in
2020. The international climate change negotiating process is highly uncertain
and management cannot predict what the outcome might be or the potential impact
it might have on the Duke Energy Registrants.  

        The Duke Energy
Registrants do not anticipate any of the states in which it currently operates
fossil-fueled electric generating units taking action absent a federal
requirement to mandate reductions in GHG emissions from these facilities.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants are taking actions today that will result in reduced GHG emissions
over time. These actions will lower the Duke Energy Registrants  exposure to
any future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether
a result of federal legislation or EPA regulation. Under any future scenario
involving mandatory GHG limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to
seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory
mechanisms.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants recognize that certain groups associate severe weather events with
climate change, and forecast the possibility that these weather events could
have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more
frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential
changes of extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and
severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take
place, and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy, make
estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants 
operations that may result from the physical risks of potential changes in the
frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events, whatever the cause or
causes might be, impossible. Currently, the Duke Energy Registrants plan and
prepare for extreme weather events that it experiences from time to time, such
as ice storms, tornados, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, high winds and
droughts.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants  past experiences preparing for and responding to the impacts of
these types of weather-related events would reasonably be expected to help
management plan and prepare for future severe weather events to reduce, but not
eliminate, the operational, economic and financial impacts of such events. For
example, the Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the
potential impact of severe weather events on its electric distribution systems.
The Duke Energy Registrants  electric generating facilities are designed to
withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy
Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the
effects of any potential short-term disruption in its fuel supply so it can
continue to provide its customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity.
The Duke Energy Registrants have a program in place to effectively manage the
impact of future droughts on its operations.  

Other
EPA Regulations Recently Published and Under Development    

The EPA has issued and
is in various stages of developing several non-greenhouse gas (non-GHG)
environmental regulations that will affect the Duke Energy Registrants. These
include the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for hazardous air
pollutants, which is effective beginning in 2015, as well as proposed
regulations for cooling water intake structures under the Clean Water Act
316(b) and proposed regulations for coal combustion residuals. As a group,
these non-GHG environmental regulations will require the Duke Energy Registrants
to install additional environmental controls and accelerate retirement of some
coal-fired units. While the ultimate regulatory requirements for the Duke
Energy Registrants from the group of EPA regulatory actions will not be known
until all the rules have been finalized, for planning purposes, the Duke Energy
Registrants currently estimate the cost of new control equipment that may need
to be installed to comply with this group of rules could total $5 billion to $6
billion, excluding AFUDC, over the next 10 years. This range includes estimated
costs for new control equipment necessary to comply with the MATS of $650
million to $800 million. The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur
increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance, and other expenses
in conjunction with the non-GHG EPA regulations. In addition to the plant
retirements associated with new generation the Duke Energy Registrants are
constructing, the Duke Energy Registrants are planning to retire additional
coal fired generating capacity that is not economic to bring into compliance
with the EPA s regulations. Beyond 2012, total planned and potential retirements
could exceed 3,900 MW of coal-fired generating capacity. The Duke Energy
Registrants would also expect to incur costs for replacement generation as a
result of the potential coal-fired power plant retirements. Until the final
regulatory requirements of the group of EPA regulations are known and can be
fully evaluated, the potential compliance costs associated with these EPA
regulatory actions are subject to considerable uncertainty. Therefore, the
actual compliance costs incurred and MW to be retired may be materially
different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the
final EPA regulations.  

  For additional
information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory
Matters  and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and
Contingencies.   

Nuclear
Matters   

Following
the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan, Duke Energy
conducted thorough inspections at each of its four nuclear sites during 2011.
Progress Energy also conducted inspections in 2011 at each of its three sites.
The initial inspections have not identified any significant vulnerabilities,
however, Duke Energy is reviewing designs to evaluate safety margins to
external events. Emergency-response capabilities, written procedures and
engineering specifications were reviewed to verify each site s ability to
respond in the unlikely event of station blackout. Duke Energy is working
within the nuclear industry to improve the safety standards and margin using
the three layers of safety approach used in the U.S.: protection, mitigation
and emergency response. Emergency equipment is currently being added at each
station to perform key safety functions in the event that backup power sources
are lost permanently. These improvements are in addition to the numerous layers
of safety measures and systems previously in place.  

  In March
2011, the NRC formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of
processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make
additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system. On July 13, 2011, the
task force proposed a set of improvements designed to ensure protection,
enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve
efficiency of NRC programs. The recommendations      

78   

PART II   

were
further prioritized into three tiers based on the safety enhancement level. On
March 12, 2012, the NRC issued three regulatory orders requiring safety
enhancements related to mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural
events resulting in the loss of power at a plant, ensuring reliable hardened
containment vents and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation.  

  In May
2012, the NRC endorsed guidance on re-evaluating emergency communications
systems and staffing levels and performing seismic and flooding walkdowns. On
July 13, 2012, the NRC outlined plans for implementing Tier 2 and Tier 3
recommendations. On August 30, 2012, the NRC issued implementation guidance to
enable power plants to achieve compliance with the orders issued in March 2012.
Plants are then required to submit implementation plans to the NRC by February
28, 2013, and complete implementation of the safety enhancements within two
refueling outages or by December 31, 2016, whichever comes first. Each plant is
also required to reassess their seismic and flooding hazards using present-day
methods and information, conduct inspections to ensure protection against
hazards in the current design basis, and re-evaluate emergency communications
systems and staffing levels.  

  Duke
Energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancements ordered by the
NRC in connection with the March 12, 2012, regulatory orders noted above, the
cost of which could be material. Until such time as the NRC mandated
reassessment of flooding and seismic hazards is complete the exact scope and
cost of compliance modifications to our sites will not be known. With the NRC s
continuing review of the remaining recommendations, Duke Energy cannot predict
to what extent the NRC will impose additional licensing and safety-related
requirements, or the costs of complying with such requirements. The tight time
frame required to complete the necessary safety enhancements by no later than
2016 could lead to even higher costs. Upon receipt of additional guidance from
the NRC and a collaborative industry review, Duke Energy will be able to
determine an implementation plan and associated costs. See Item 1A,  Risk
Factors,  for further discussion of applicable risk factors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    

  To the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of  

  Duke Energy Corporation   

  Charlotte, North Carolina   

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of   Duke Energy Corporation   and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012,
based on the criteria established in    Internal Control   Integrated Framework
   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying    Management s
Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   . Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.  

  We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   

  A company's internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.   

  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of
the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.   

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of   Duke Energy Corporation   and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria
established in    Internal Control   Integrated Framework    issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission   .

  We conducted our audits in accordance with the

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence

in the United States (U.S.) and Latin America primarily through its direct and
indirect subsidiaries. Duke Energy s subsidiaries included Duke Energy
Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas), Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy
Ohio), which includes Duke Energy Kentucky, Inc. (Duke Energy Kentucky), and
Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (Duke Energy Indiana) prior to the merger with
Progress Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy). On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy merged
with Progress Energy, with Duke Energy continuing as the surviving corporation,
and Progress Energy becoming a subsidiary of Duke Energy. Carolina Power  
Light Company d/b/a Progress Energy Carolinas, Inc. (Progress Energy Carolinas)
and Florida Power Corporation d/b/a Progress Energy Florida, Inc. (Progress
Energy Florida), Progress Energy s regulated utility subsidiaries, are now
indirect subsidiaries of Duke Energy. Duke Energy s consolidated financial
statements include Progress Energy, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress
Energy Florida activity beginning July 2, 2012. See Note 2 for additional
information regarding the merger. When discussing Duke Energy s consolidated
financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its six separate
subsidiary registrants, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Progress Energy
Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana
(collectively referred to as the Subsidiary Registrants), which, along with
Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.   

  Progress
Energy, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida (collectively
referred to as the Progress Energy Registrants) continue to maintain reporting
requirements as SEC registrants. In accordance with SEC guidance, the Progress
Energy Registrants did not reflect the impacts of acquisition accounting from
the merger with Duke Energy, whereby the adjustments of assets and liabilities
to fair value and the resultant goodwill would be shown on the financial
statements of the Progress Energy Registrants. These adjustments were recorded
by Duke Energy.  

  The
information in these combined notes relates to each of the Duke Energy
Registrants as noted in the Index to the Combined Notes. However, none of the
registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to Duke
Energy or the subsidiaries of Duke Energy other than itself. As discussed
further in Note 3, Duke Energy operates three reportable business segments:
U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas (USFE G), Commercial Power and International
Energy. The remainder of Duke Energy s operations is presented as Other.  

  These
Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany
transactions and balances, the accounts of the Duke Energy Registrants and all
majority-owned subsidiaries where the respective Duke Energy Registrants have
control and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the respective Duke
Energy Registrants are the primary beneficiary. These Consolidated Financial
Statements also reflect the Duke Energy Registrants  proportionate share of
certain generation and transmission facilities. In January 2012, Duke Energy
Ohio completed the sale of its 75% ownership of the Vermillion Generating

   Reverse
Stock Split.   

  On July
2, 2012, just prior to the close of the merger with Progress Energy, Duke
Energy executed a one-for-three reverse stock split with respect to the issued
and outstanding shares of Duke Energy common stock. All per-share amounts
included in this Form 10-K are presented as if the one-for-three reverse stock
split had been effective from the beginning of the earliest period presented.  

   Use of
Estimates.    

  To
conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S.,
management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. Although these estimates are
based on management s best available information at the time, actual results
could differ.   

   Cost-Based
Regulation.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants account for their regulated operations in accordance with
applicable regulatory accounting guidance. The economic effects of regulation
can result in a regulated company recording assets for costs that have been or
are expected to be approved for recovery from customers in a future period or
recording liabilities for amounts that are expected to be returned to customers
in the rate-setting process in a period different from the period in which the
amounts would be recorded by an unregulated enterprise. Accordingly, the Duke
Energy Registrants record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated
ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated
entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the
treatment of the related cost in the ratemaking process. Management continually
assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by
considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders
applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or
potential deregulation legislation. Additionally, management continually
assesses whether any regulatory liabilities have been incurred. Based on this
continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are
probable of recovery and that no regulatory liabilities, other than those
recorded, have been incurred. These regulatory assets and liabilities are
classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Regulatory assets and Other in
Current Assets and as Regulatory liabilities and Other in Current Liabilities,
respectively. The Duke Energy Registrants periodically evaluate the
applicability of regulatory accounting treatment by considering factors such as
regulatory changes and the impact of competition. If cost-based regulation ends
or competition increases, the Duke Energy Registrants may have to reduce their
asset balances to reflect a market basis less than cost and write-off the
associated regulatory assets and liabilities. If it becomes probable that part
of the cost of a plant under construction or a recently completed plant will be
disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of
the disallowance can be made, that amount is recognized as a loss.   

  In
November 2011, in conjunction with the PUCO s approval of its new Electric
Security Plan (ESP), Duke Energy Ohio ceased applying regulatory accounting
treatment to generation operations within its Commercial Power segment.   

  For
further information, see Note 4.  

   Energy
Purchases, Fuel Costs and Fuel Cost Deferrals.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants utilize cost-tracking mechanisms, commonly referred to as a
fuel adjustment clause, to recover the retail portion of fuel and purchased
power. The Duke Energy Registrants defer the related cost through Fuel used in
electric generation and purchased power   regulated on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations, unless a regulatory requirement exists for deferral
through Operating Revenues.   

  Fuel
used in electric generation and purchased power   regulated includes fuel,
purchased power and recoverable costs that are deferred through fuel clauses
established by the Subsidiary Registrants  regulators. These clauses allow the
Subsidiary Registrants to recover fuel costs, fuel-related costs and portions
of purchased power costs through surcharges on customer rates. The Subsidiary
Registrants record any under-recovery or over-recovery resulting from the
differences between estimated and actual costs as a regulatory asset or
regulatory

liability until billed or refunded to
customers, at which point the differences are adjusted through revenues.
Indiana law limits the amount of fuel costs that Duke Energy Indiana can
recover to an amount that will not result in earning a return in excess of that
allowed by the IURC.  

  As
discussed in Note 4, beginning January 1, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio procures
energy for its retail customers through a third-party auction. Purchases of
energy through the auction process are a pass-through of costs for Duke Energy
Ohio, with no affect on earnings. Subsequent to December 31, 2011, Duke
Energy Ohio s generation assets are no longer dedicated to retail customers
and, accordingly, Duke Energy Ohio can no longer recover their generation
assets  energy purchases and fuel costs from regulated customers.   

   Cash
and Cash Equivalents.    

  All
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date
of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. At December 31, 2012, Duke
Energy had cash and cash equivalents of $1,424 million, of which $731 million
is held in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund
international operations and investments.  

   Restricted
Cash.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants have restricted cash related primarily to collateral assets,
escrow deposits, and restricted cash of VIEs. Restricted cash balances are
reflected in Other within Current Assets and in Other within Investments and
Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

Inventory.   

   Inventory
is comprised of amounts presented in the tables below and is recorded primarily
using the average cost method. Inventory related to the Duke Energy
Registrants  regulated operations is valued at historical cost consistent with
ratemaking treatment. Materials and supplies are recorded as inventory when
purchased and subsequently charged to expense or capitalized to property, plant
and equipment when installed. Reserves are established for excess and obsolete
inventory. Inventory related to the Duke Energy Registrants  nonregulated
operations is valued at the lower of cost or market.     The following tables
present the Duke Energy Registrants  inventory.  

Duke
Energy Ohio has agreements with a third party through which title of natural
gas inventory purchased by Duke Energy Ohio is transferred to a third party.
Under the agreements, the gas inventory is stored and managed for Duke Energy
Ohio and is delivered on demand. As a result of the agreements, the combined
natural gas inventory of approximately $44 million and $50 million being held by
a third party as of December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively, was
classified as Other within Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

       Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants classify investments into two categories   trading and
available-for-sale. Trading securities are reported at fair value in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets with net realized and unrealized gains and losses
included in earnings each period. Available-for-sale securities are also
reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with unrealized gains
and losses included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) or as a
regulatory asset or liability, unless it is determined that the carrying value
of an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Other-than-temporary
impairments related to equity securities and the credit loss portion of debt
securities are included in earnings, unless deferred in accordance with
regulatory accounting treatment. Investments in debt and equity

   Goodwill.

Duke
Energy and Duke Energy Ohio perform annual goodwill impairment tests as of
August 31 each year and update these tests between annual tests if events
or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of
a reporting unit below its carrying value.   

  In 2012,
Progress Energy changed its goodwill impairment testing date from October 31 to
August 31. The change in the goodwill impairment test date is preferable as it
better aligns the annual goodwill impairment testing procedures with the
testing procedures of Duke Energy. The change in accounting principle did not
accelerate, delay, avoid, or cause a goodwill impairment charge. Neither the
change in the goodwill impairment testing date nor the merger resulted in any
changes to the Progress Energy reporting units. Due to significant judgments
and estimates that are utilized in a goodwill impairment analysis, Progress
Energy determined it was impracticable to objectively determine, without the
use of hindsight, projected cash flows and related valuation estimates as of
each August 31, for periods prior to August 31, 2012. As such, the change in
the annual goodwill impairment testing date was prospectively applied from
August 31, 2012.  

  Duke
Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Ohio perform the annual review for
goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which Duke Energy and Progress
Energy have determined to be an operating segment or one level below and which
Duke Energy Ohio has determined to be an operating segment.   

  The
annual goodwill impairment test may first consider qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. greater than 50 percent
chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value.
This is sometimes referred to as  step zero  and is an optional step in the
annual goodwill impairment analysis (see further discussion as discussed in
 New Accounting Standards  below). If the results of qualitative assessments
indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less
than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the two-step impairment test is
required. Step one of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of
reporting units with their carrying values, including goodwill. If the carrying
amount is less than fair value in step one, further testing of goodwill is not
performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting
unit s fair value, step two must be performed to determine the amount, if any,
of the goodwill impairment loss. Step two of the goodwill impairment test
involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill
against the carrying value of the goodwill. Under step two, determining the implied
fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit s
identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting
unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date. The
difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in
step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities
represents the implied fair value of goodwill. The goodwill impairment charge,
if any, would be the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied
fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two.   

  As a
result of the Progress Energy merger, Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke
Energy Ohio performed step one of the goodwill impairment test as of August 31,
2012, and concluded the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their
respective carrying values, and thus, did not record any impairment charges. In
2011, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Ohio performed the qualitative assessments
under step zero and concluded that it was more likely than not the fair value
of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In 2011, Progress Energy
performed step one of the goodwill impairment test, which indicated the
carrying amounts of goodwill were not impaired. In 2010, Duke Energy, Progress
Energy and Duke Energy Ohio used the two-step process to test goodwill for
impairment, which resulted in impairments recorded by Duke Energy and Duke
Energy Ohio.   

  See Note
12 for further information.   

   Long-Lived
Asset Impairments.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants evaluate whether long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, have
been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets
may not be recoverable. For such long-lived assets, an impairment exists when
its carrying value exceeds the sum of estimates of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When
alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived
asset are under consideration, a probability-weighted approach is used for
developing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying value
of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on these estimated future
undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the
carrying value of the asset over its fair value, such that the asset s carrying
value is adjusted to its estimated fair value.   

  Management
assesses the fair value of long-lived assets using commonly accepted
techniques, and may use more than one source. Sources to determine fair value
include, but are not limited to, recent third party comparable sales,
internally developed discounted cash flow analysis and analysis from outside
advisors. Significant changes in market conditions resulting from events such
as, among others, changes in commodity prices or the condition of an asset, or
a change in management s intent to utilize the asset are generally viewed by
management as triggering events to re-assess the cash flows related to the
long-lived assets.   

  See Note
12 for further information.   

   Property,
Plant and Equipment.    

  Property,
plant and equipment are stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated
depreciation or fair value, if impaired. The Duke Energy Registrants capitalize
all construction-related direct labor and material costs, as well as indirect
construction costs. Indirect costs include general engineering, taxes and the allowance
for funds used during construction (AFUDC). See  AFUDC and Interest
Capitalized,  below for additional information. The cost of renewals and
betterments that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are
also capitalized. The cost of repairs, replacements and major maintenance
projects, which do not extend the useful life or increase the expected output
of the asset, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is generally computed over
the estimated useful life of the asset using the composite straight-line
method. For regulated operations, depreciation studies are conducted
periodically to update the composite rates and

are
approved by the various state commissions. The composite weighted-average
depreciation rates, excluding nuclear fuel, for each of the Duke Energy
Registrants are included in the following table:   

When the
Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, plant and equipment under
what is considered a normal retirement, the original cost plus the cost of
retirement, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation,
consistent with regulated rate-making practices. When it becomes probable that
a regulated generation asset will be retired substantially in advance of its
original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the
corresponding accumulated depreciation is removed from Cost and Accumulated
depreciation and amortization within Property, Plant and Equipment on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and a separate asset is recognized. If the plant is
still in operation, the amount is classified as Generation facilities to be
retired, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the plant is no longer
operating, then a regulatory asset is recognized. The carrying value of the
asset is based on historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are allowed to
recover the remaining net book value and a full return on the asset. If the
Duke Energy Registrants do not expect to recover the full remaining cost and a
full return, the carrying value of the asset is based on the lower of cost or
the present value of the future revenues expected to be provided to recover the
allowable costs discounted at the Duke Energy Registrants  incremental
borrowing rate. An impairment is recognized if the net book value of the asset
exceeds the present value of the future revenues to be recovered in rates.   

  When the
Duke Energy Registrants sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or
sell nonregulated properties, the original cost is removed from property and
the related accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are reduced. Any
gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the
applicable regulatory body.   

  See Note
10 for further information on the components and estimated useful lives of Duke
Energy s property, plant and equipment.   

   Nuclear
Fuel.    

  Nuclear
fuel is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Nuclear fuel in the front-end fuel processing phase is considered work
in progress and not amortized until placed in service. Amortization of nuclear
fuel is included within Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power-regulated
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amortization is recorded
using the units-of-production method.   

   AFUDC
and Interest Capitalized.    

  In
accordance with applicable regulatory accounting guidance, the Duke Energy
Registrants record AFUDC, which represents the estimated debt and equity costs
of capital funds necessary to finance the construction of new regulated
facilities. The equity component of AFUDC is a non-cash amount within the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. AFUDC is capitalized as a component of the
cost of property, plant and equipment, with an offsetting credit to Other
income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
equity component and as an offset to Interest Expense on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the debt component. After construction is
completed, the Duke Energy Registrants are permitted to recover these costs
through inclusion in the rate base and the corresponding depreciation expense
or nuclear fuel expense.   

  AFUDC
equity is a permanent difference item for income tax purposes, thus reducing
the Duke Energy Registrants  effective tax rate during the construction phase
in which AFUDC equity is being recorded. The effective tax rate is subsequently
increased in future periods when the completed property, plant and equipment are
placed in service and depreciation of the AFUDC equity commences. See Note 24
for information related to the impacts of AFUDC equity on the Duke Energy
Registrants  effective tax rate.   

  For nonregulated
operations, interest is capitalized during the construction phase in accordance
with the applicable accounting guidance.   

   Asset
Retirement Obligations.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants recognize asset retirement obligations for legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the asset, and for
conditional asset retirement obligations. The term conditional asset retirement
obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity
in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future
event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation
to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though
uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Thus, the
timing and (or) method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. When
recording an asset retirement obligation, the present value of the projected
liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is then accreted over time by
applying an interest method of allocation to the liability. Substantially all
accretion is related to regulated operations and is deferred pursuant to
regulatory accounting. The present value of the liability is added to the
carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is
depreciated over the remaining life of the asset.   

  The
present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on
discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding the timing of future
cash flows, the selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among
other factors. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a
point in time and are subject to change. The obligations for nuclear
decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas
and Progress Energy Carolinas assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear
facilities,

which reflects dismantling the site after
operations are ceased. Progress Energy Florida assumes the nuclear facility
will be placed into a safe storage configuration until the eventual dismantling
of the site begins in approximately 40-60 years. The nuclear decommissioning
asset retirement obligation also assumes Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy
Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida will store spent fuel on site until such
time that it can be transferred to a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility.   

  See Note
9 for further information.   

   Revenue
Recognition and Unbilled Revenue.    

  Revenues
on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when either the service is
provided or the product is delivered. Unbilled retail revenues are estimated by
applying average revenue per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or per thousand cubic feet
(Mcf) for all customer classes to the number of estimated kWh or Mcf delivered
but not billed. Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are calculated by applying
the contractual rate per megawatt-hour (MWh) to the number of estimated MWh
delivered but not yet billed. Unbilled wholesale demand revenues are calculated
by applying the contractual rate per megawatt (MW) to the MW volume delivered
but not yet billed. The amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from
period to period as a result of numerous factors, including seasonality,
weather, customer usage patterns and customer mix.   

  The
Duke Energy Registrants had unbilled revenues within Receivables and within
Restricted receivables of variable interest entities on their respective
Consolidated Balance Sheets as shown in the table below.  

Additionally,
Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell, on a revolving basis, nearly all
of their retail and wholesale accounts receivable to Cinergy Receivables
Company, LLC (CRC). These transfers meet sales/derecognition criteria and,
therefore, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana account for the transfers
of receivables to Cinergy Receivables as sales. Accordingly, the receivables
sold are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio
and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 18 for further information. Receivables for
unbilled revenues related to retail and wholesale accounts receivable at Duke
Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana included in the sales of accounts
receivable to CRC were as shown in the table below.

limited basis, for various business risks and losses, such as property,
business interruption, workers  compensation and general liability. Liabilities
include provisions for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR),
as well as provisions for known claims which have been estimated on a
claims-incurred basis. IBNR reserve estimates involve the use of assumptions
and are primarily based upon historical loss experience, industry data and
other actuarial assumptions. Reserve estimates are adjusted in future periods
as actual losses differ from historical experience.   

  Duke
Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage
with third parties, which provides reimbursement for certain losses above a per
occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Duke Energy recognizes a reinsurance
receivable for recovery of incurred losses under its captive s reinsurance
coverage once realization of the receivable is deemed probable.       

     Unamortized
Debt Premium, Discount and Expense.    

  Premiums,
discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt
are amortized over the terms of the debt issues. Any call premiums or
unamortized expenses associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations used
to finance regulated assets and operations are amortized consistent with
regulatory treatment of those items, where appropriate. The amortization
expense is recorded as a component of Interest Expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and is reflected as Depreciation, amortization and
accretion within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.     

   Loss
Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities.    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants are involved in certain legal and environmental matters that
arise in the normal course of business. Contingent losses are recorded when it
is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists
and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the
Duke Energy Registrants record a loss contingency at the minimum amount in the
range. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.   

  Environmental
liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when the necessity for
environmental remediation becomes probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated, or when other potential environmental liabilities are reasonably
estimable and probable. The Duke Energy Registrants expense environmental
expenditures related to conditions caused by past operations that do not
generate current or future revenues. Certain environmental expenses receive
regulatory accounting treatment, under which the expenses are recorded as
regulatory assets. Environmental expenditures related to operations that
generate current or future revenues are expensed or capitalized, as
appropriate.   

  See Note
5 for further information.   

   Pension
and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.    

  Duke
Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit
plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in the
respective Duke Energy or Progress Energy qualified, non-qualified and other
post-retirement benefit plans and are allocated their proportionate share of
benefit costs.   

  See Note
23 for information related to Duke Energy s benefit plans, including certain
accounting policies associated with these plans.   

       Severance and Special
Termination Benefits.    

  Duke
Energy has an ongoing severance plan under which, in general, the longer a
terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of
severance benefits. The Duke Energy Registrants record a liability for
involuntary severance once an involuntary severance plan is committed to by
management, or sooner, if involuntary severances are probable and the related
severance benefits can be reasonably estimated. For involuntary severance
benefits that are incremental to its ongoing severance plan benefits, Duke
Energy measures the obligation and records the expense at its fair value at the
communication date if there are no future service requirements, or, if future
service is required to receive the termination benefit, ratably over the
service period. From time to time, Duke Energy offers special termination
benefits under voluntary severance programs. Special termination benefits are
measured upon employee acceptance and recorded immediately absent a significant
retention period. If a significant retention period exists, the cost of the
special termination benefits are recorded ratably over the remaining service
periods of the affected employees. Employee acceptance of voluntary severance
benefits is determined by management based on the facts and circumstances of
the special termination benefits being offered.   

  See Note
21 for further information.    

Guarantees.    

  Upon
issuance or modification of a guarantee, the Duke Energy Registrants recognize
a liability at the time of issuance or material modification for the estimated
fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee, if any. Fair
value is estimated using a probability-weighted approach. The Duke Energy Registrants
reduce the obligation over the term of the guarantee or related contract in a
systematic and rational method as risk is reduced under the obligation. Any
additional contingent loss for guarantee contracts subsequent to the initial

  The Duke
Energy Registrants have entered into various indemnification agreements related
to purchase and sale agreements and other types of contractual agreements with
vendors and other third parties. These agreements typically cover
environmental, tax, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of
representations, warranties and covenants. Typically, claims may be made by
third parties for various periods of time, depending on the nature of the
claim. Potential exposure under these indemnification agreements can range from
a specified to an unlimited dollar amount, depending on the nature of the claim
and the particular transaction.

Stock-Based
Compensation.    

  Stock-based
compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to
employees. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the
estimated fair value of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. The
recognition period for these costs begin at either the applicable service
inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite service
period, or for certain share-based awards until the employee becomes retirement
eligible, if earlier. Share-based awards, including stock options, but not
performance shares, granted to employees that are already retirement eligible are
deemed to have vested immediately upon issuance, and, therefore, compensation
cost for those awards is recognized on the date such awards are granted.   

  See Note
22 for further information.   

   Accounting
For Purchases and Sales of Emission Allowances.    

  Emission
allowances are issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at zero cost
and permit the holder of the allowance to emit certain gaseous by-products of
fossil fuel combustion, including sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen
oxide (NO x ). Allowances may also be bought and sold via third-party
transactions. Allowances allocated to or acquired by the Duke Energy
Registrants are held primarily for consumption. Emission allowances at cost are
included in Intangibles, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Duke
Energy Registrants recognize expense as the allowances are consumed or sold.
Gains or losses on sales of emission allowances by regulated businesses that do
not provide for direct recovery through a cost-tracking mechanism and by nonregulated
businesses are presented in Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net, in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For regulated businesses that
provide for direct recovery of emission allowances, any gain or loss on sales
of recoverable emission allowances are included in the rate structure of the
regulated entity and are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. Future
rates charged to retail customers are impacted by any gain or loss on sales of
recoverable emission allowances. Purchases and sales of emission allowances are
presented gross as investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows. See Note 12 for discussion regarding the impairment of the carrying
value of certain emission allowances in 2011.   

   Income
Taxes.    

  Duke
Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and
other state and foreign jurisdictional returns as required. Deferred income
taxes have been provided for temporary differences between the GAAP and tax
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. These differences create taxable or
tax-deductible amounts for future periods. Investment tax credits (ITC)
associated with regulated operations are deferred and are amortized as a
reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related
properties.   

  The
Subsidiary Registrants entered into a tax sharing agreement with Duke Energy,
where the separate return method is used to allocate tax expenses and benefits
to the subsidiaries whose investments or results of operations provide these
tax expenses or benefits. The accounting for income taxes essentially
represents the income taxes that the Subsidiary Registrants would incur if the
Subsidiary Registrants were a separate company filing its own federal tax
return as a C-Corporation. The Duke Energy Registrants record unrecognized tax
benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns, including
the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return, when a
more-likely-than-not threshold is met for a tax position and management
believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical
merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will
be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant
information. The Duke Energy Registrants record the largest amount of the
unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
settlement or effective settlement. Management considers a tax position
effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax
benefits when the following conditions exist: (i) the taxing authority has
completed its examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative
reviews that the taxing authority is required and expected to perform for the
tax positions, (ii) the Duke Energy Registrants do not intend to appeal or
litigate any aspect of the tax position included in the completed examination,
and (iii) it is remote that the taxing authority would examine or
reexamine any aspect of the tax position. Deferred taxes are not provided on
translation gains and losses where Duke Energy expects earnings of a foreign
operation to be indefinitely reinvested.   

  The Duke
Energy Registrants record tax-related interest expense in Interest Expense and
interest income and penalties in Other Income and Expenses, net, in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

  See Note
24 for further information.   

   Accounting
for Renewable Energy Tax Credits and Grants.    

  In 2009,
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Stimulus Bill) was
signed into law, which provides tax incentives in the form of ITC or cash
grants for renewable energy facilities and renewable generation property either
placed in service through specified dates or for which construction has begun
prior to specified dates. Under the Stimulus Bill, Duke Energy may elect an
ITC, which is determined based on a percentage of the tax basis of the qualified
property placed in service, for property placed in service after 2008 and
before 2014 (2013 for wind facilities) or a cash grant, which allows entities
to elect to receive a cash grant in lieu of the ITC for certain property either
placed in service in 2009 or 2010 or for which construction begins in 2009 and
2010. In 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job
Creation Act of 2010 (the 2010 Tax Relief Act) extended the cash grant program
for renewable energy property for one additional year, through 2011. In 2011,
the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) was passed which provided for an automatic
reduction in defense and non-defense spending beginning January 1, 2013, which
could reduce future cash grant payments since such grants are likely to be
treated as non-defense discretionary spending subject to reduction under the
sequester. In 2012, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the ATRA)
extended the ITC (energy credit) and production tax credits available for wind
facilities one year, through 2013, and changed the timing for determining
property eligible for the ITC, from property placed in service before the
credit deadline, to property under construction by the applicable deadline for
the credit. The ATRA delayed the start of the automatic reductions/sequester
under the BCA from January 1 to March 1, 2013. When Duke Energy elects either
the ITC or cash grant on Commercial Power s wind or solar facilities that meet

the stipulations of the Stimulus Bill, Duke Energy
reduces the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
by the amount of the ITC or cash grant and, therefore, the ITC or grant benefit
is recognized ratably over the life of the associated asset through reduced
depreciation expense. Additionally, certain tax credits and government grants
received under the Stimulus Bill provide for an incremental initial tax
depreciable base in excess of the carrying value for GAAP purposes, creating an
initial deferred tax asset equal to the tax effect of one half of the ITC or
government grant. Duke Energy records the deferred tax benefit as a reduction
to income tax expense in the period that the basis difference is created.   

   Excise
Taxes.    

  Certain
excise taxes levied by state or local governments are collected by the Duke
Energy Registrants from their customers. These taxes, which are required to be
paid regardless of the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to collect from the
customer, are accounted for on a gross basis. When the Duke Energy Registrants
act as an agent, and the tax is not required to be remitted if it is not
collected from the customer, the taxes are accounted for on a net basis. The
Duke Energy Registrants  excise taxes accounted for on a gross basis and
recorded as operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
were as follows:   

Foreign Currency Translation.    

  The local currencies
of Duke Energy s foreign operations have been determined to be their functional
currencies, except for certain foreign operations whose functional currency has
been determined to be the U.S. Dollar, based on an assessment of the
economic circumstances of the foreign operation   .     Assets and liabilities
of foreign operations, except for those whose functional currency is the
U.S. Dollar, are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in
effect at period end. Translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in
exchange rates are included as a separate component of AOCI. Revenue and
expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates
prevailing during the year. Gains and losses arising from balances and
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
included in the results of operations in the period in which they occur.  

Dividend Restrictions
and Unappropriated Retained Earnings.    

  Duke Energy does not
have any legal, regulatory or other restrictions on paying common stock
dividends to shareholders. However, as further described in Note 4, due to
conditions established by regulators at the time of the Duke Energy/Cinergy
merger in April 2006 and the Duke Energy/Progress Energy merger in 2012,
certain wholly owned subsidiaries, including Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress
Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana, have restrictions
on paying dividends or otherwise advancing funds to Duke Energy. At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, an insignificant amount of Duke Energy s
consolidated Retained earnings balance represents undistributed earnings of
equity method investments.         

       New Accounting
Standards.    

  The
following new accounting standards were adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants
during the year ended December 31, 2012, and the impact of such adoption,
if applicable, has been presented in the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements:   

   Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 220  
Comprehensive Income.   
In June
2011, the FASB amended the existing requirements for presenting comprehensive
income in financial statements primarily to increase the prominence of items
reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) and to facilitate the convergence
of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Specifically, the revised guidance eliminates the option previously provided to
present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders 
equity. Accordingly, all non-owner changes in stockholders  equity are required
to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income
or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. For the Duke Energy
Registrants, this revised guidance was effective on a retrospective basis for
interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of this
standard changed the presentation of the Duke Energy Registrants  financial
statements but did not affect the calculation of net income, comprehensive
income or earnings per share.  

   ASC
820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.        In May 2011, the FASB
amended existing requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing
information about fair value measurements. This revised guidance results in a
consistent definition of fair value, as well as common requirements for
measurement and disclosure of fair value information between U.S. GAAP and
IFRS. In addition, the amendments set forth enhanced disclosure requirements
with respect to recurring Level 3 measurements, nonfinancial assets measured or
disclosed at fair value, transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy,
and assets and liabilities disclosed but not recorded at fair value. For the
Duke Energy Registrants, the revised fair value measurement guidance was effective
on a prospective basis for interim and annual periods beginning January 1,
2012. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on
the Duke Energy Registrants disclosures or their consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, or financial position.  

  The
following new accounting standards were adopted by Duke Energy during the year
ended December 31, 2011, and the impact of such adoption, if applicable
has been presented in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:   

   ASC
605   Revenue Recognition.    In October 2009, the FASB issued new revenue recognition
accounting guidance in response to practice concerns related to the accounting
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This new accounting
guidance primarily

applies to all contractual
arrangements in which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating
activities and addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving
multiple deliverables, as well as how arrangement consideration should be allocated
to the separate units of accounting. For the Duke Energy Registrants, the new
accounting guidance was effective January 1, 2011, and applied on a
prospective basis. This new accounting guidance did not have a material impact
to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of
the Duke Energy Registrants.   

   ASC
805   Business Combinations.    In November 2010, the FASB issued new
accounting guidance in response to diversity in the interpretation of pro forma
information disclosure requirements for business combinations. The new
accounting guidance requires an entity to present pro forma financial
information as if a business combination occurred at the beginning of the
earliest period presented as well as additional disclosures describing the
nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments. This new
accounting guidance was effective January 1, 2011, and has been applied to
all business combinations consummated after that date.   

   ASC
820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.    In January 2010, the
FASB amended existing fair value measurements and disclosures accounting
guidance to clarify certain existing disclosure requirements and to require a
number of additional disclosures, including amounts and reasons for significant
transfers between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy, and
presentation of certain information in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3
measurements on a gross basis. For the Duke Energy Registrants, certain
portions of this revised accounting guidance were effective on January 1,
2010, with additional disclosures effective for periods beginning
January 1, 2011. The adoption of this accounting guidance resulted in
additional disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements but
did not have an impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  consolidated results of
operations, cash flows or financial position.   

   ASC
350   Intangibles Goodwill and Other.    In September 2011, the FASB amended existing
goodwill impairment testing accounting guidance to provide an entity testing
goodwill for impairment with the option of performing a qualitative assessment
prior to calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step one of a
goodwill impairment test. Under this revised guidance, a qualitative assessment
would require an evaluation of economic, industry, and company-specific
considerations. If an entity determines, on a basis of such qualitative
factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less
than the carrying value of a reporting unit, the two-step impairment test, as
required under pre-existing applicable accounting guidance, would be required.
Otherwise, no further impairment testing would be required. The revised
goodwill impairment testing accounting guidance is effective for the Duke
Energy Registrants  annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for
fiscal years beginning January 1, 2012, with early adoption of this
revised guidance permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed
as of a date before September 15, 2011. Since annual goodwill impairment
tests are performed by Duke Energy as of August 31, the Duke Energy
Registrants early adopted this revised accounting guidance during the third
quarter of 2011 and applied that guidance to their annual goodwill impairment
tests for 2011.   

  The
following new accounting standards were adopted by Duke Energy during the year
ended December 31, 2010, and the impact of such adoption, if applicable
has been presented in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:   

   ASC
860   Transfers and Servicing.    In June 2009, the FASB issued revised
accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishment of liabilities, to require additional information about transfers
of financial assets, including securitization transactions, as well as
additional information about an enterprise s continuing exposure to the risks
related to transferred financial assets. This revised accounting guidance
eliminated the concept of a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE) and
required those entities which were not subject to consolidation under previous
accounting rules to now be assessed for consolidation. In addition, this
accounting guidance clarified and amended the derecognition criteria for
transfers of financial assets (including transfers of portions of financial
assets) and required additional disclosures about a transferor s continuing
involvement in transferred financial assets. For Duke Energy, this revised
accounting guidance was effective prospectively for transfers of financial
assets occurring on or after January 1, 2010, and early adoption of this
statement was prohibited. Since 2002, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana,
and Duke Energy Kentucky have sold, on a revolving basis, nearly all of their
accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a bankruptcy-remote
QSPE. The securitization transaction was structured to meet the criteria for
sale accounting treatment, and, accordingly, Duke Energy did not consolidate
CRC, and the transfers were accounted for as sales. Effective with adoption of
this revised accounting guidance and ASC 810-Consolidation, as discussed below,
the accounting treatment and/or financial statement presentation of Duke
Energy s accounts receivable securitization programs was impacted as Duke
Energy began consolidating CRC effective January 1, 2010. Duke Energy
Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s sales of accounts receivable and related
financial statement presentation were not impacted by the adoption of ASC 860.   

   ASC
810   Consolidations.   
In June 2009, the FASB amended existing consolidation accounting guidance
to eliminate the exemption from consolidation for QSPEs, and clarified, but did
not significantly change, the criteria for determining whether an entity meets
the definition of a VIE. This revised accounting guidance also required an
enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary
of a VIE based on whether that enterprise has both the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a VIE and
the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of a VIE that
could potentially be significant to a VIE. In addition, this revised accounting
guidance modified existing accounting guidance to require an ongoing evaluation
of a VIE s primary beneficiary and amended the types of events that trigger a
reassessment of whether an entity is a VIE. Furthermore, this accounting
guidance required enterprises to provide additional disclosures about their
involvement with VIEs and any significant changes in their risk exposure due to
that involvement.   

  For the
Duke Energy Registrants, this accounting guidance was effective beginning on
January 1, 2010, and is applicable to all entities in which Duke Energy is
involved, including entities previously subject to existing accounting guidance
for VIEs, as well as any QSPEs that existed as of the effective date. Effective
with adoption of this revised accounting guidance, the accounting treatment
and/or financial statement presentation of Duke Energy s accounts receivable
securitization programs were impacted as Duke Energy began consolidating CRC
effective January 1, 2010. Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s sales
of accounts receivable and related financial statement presentation were not
impacted by the adoption of ASC 810. This revised accounting guidance did not
have a significant impact on any of the Duke Energy Registrants  other
interests in VIEs.   

   ASC
820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.    In January 2010, the
FASB amended existing fair value measurements and disclosures accounting
guidance to clarify certain existing disclosure requirements and to require a
number of additional disclosures, including amounts and reasons for significant
transfers between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy, and
presentation of certain information in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3
measurements on a gross basis. For the Duke Energy Registrants, certain portions

accounting guidance were effective on
January 1, 2010, with additional disclosures effective for periods
beginning January 1, 2011. The initial adoption of this accounting
guidance resulted in additional disclosure in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements but did not have an impact on the Duke Energy Registrants 
consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.   

  The
following new Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) have been issued, but have not
yet been adopted by Duke Energy, as of December 31, 2012.  

   ASC 210   Balance Sheet.    In December 2011, the
FASB issued revised accounting guidance to amend the existing disclosure
requirements for offsetting financial assets and liabilities to enhance current
disclosures, as well as to improve comparability of balance sheets prepared
under U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The revised disclosure guidance affects all companies
that have financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either
offset in the balance sheet (i.e., presented on a net basis) or subject to an
enforceable master netting arrangement and/or similar agreement. The revised
guidance requires that certain enhanced quantitative and qualitative
disclosures be made with respect to a company s netting arrangements and/or
rights of setoff associated with its financial instruments and/or derivative
instruments including associated collateral. For the Duke Energy Registrants,
the revised disclosure guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for
interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2013. Other than additional
disclosures, this revised guidance does not impact the Duke Energy Registrants 
consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  

   ASC 220  
Comprehensive Income   .
In February 2013, the FASB amended the existing requirements for presenting
comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the reporting of
reclassifications out of AOCI. The amendments in this Update seek to attain
that objective by requiring an entity to report the effect of significant
reclassifications out of AOCI on the respective line items in net income if the
amount being reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in its
entirety to net income. For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP
to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting
period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures required
under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. This would
be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of AOCI is
reclassified to a balance sheet account (for example, inventory) instead of
directly to income or expense in the same reporting period. For the Duke Energy
Registrants, this revised guidance is effective on a prospective basis for
interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2013. Other than additional
disclosures or a change in the presentation on the statement of comprehensive
income, this revised guidance does not impact the Duke Energy Registrants 
consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.      

2. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIO  NS
AND SALES OF OTHER ASSETS   

Acquisitions.   

The Duke Energy
Registrants consolidate assets and liabilities from acquisitions as of the
purchase date, and include earnings from acquisitions in consolidated earnings
after the purchase date.   

   Merger with Progress Energy   

    Description of Transaction     

  On July 2, 2012, Duke
Energy completed the merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(Merger Agreement), among Diamond Acquisition Corporation, a North Carolina
corporation and Duke Energy s wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub) and Progress
Energy, a North Carolina corporation engaged in the regulated utility business
of generation, transmission and distribution and sale of electricity in
portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. As a result of the
merger, Merger Sub was merged into Progress Energy and Progress Energy became a
wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy.   

  The merger between Duke
Energy and Progress Energy provides increased scale and diversity with
potentially enhanced access to capital over the long term and a greater ability
to undertake the significant construction programs necessary to respond to
increasing environmental regulation, plant retirements and customer demand
growth. Duke Energy s business risk profile is expected to improve over time
due to the increased proportion of the business that is regulated.
Additionally, cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits are expected from
the combined operations.   

  Progress Energy s
shareholders received 0.87083 shares of Duke Energy common stock in exchange
for each share of Progress Energy common stock outstanding as of July 2, 2012.
Generally, all outstanding Progress Energy equity-based compensation awards
were converted into Duke Energy equity-based compensation awards using the same
ratio. The merger was structured as a tax-free exchange of shares.  

  Refer to Note 5 for
information regarding Progress Energy merger shareholder litigation.  

    Merger Related Regulatory Matters    

    Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.     On June 8, 2012, the FERC conditionally approved the
merger including Duke Energy and Progress Energy s revised market power
mitigation plan, the Joint Dispatch Agreement (JDA) and the joint Open Access
Transmission Tariff (OATT). The revised market power mitigation plan provides
for the acceleration of one transmission project and the construction of seven
other transmission projects (Long-term FERC Mitigation) and interim firm power
sale agreements during the construction of the transmission projects (Interim
FERC Mitigation). The Long-term FERC Mitigation will increase power imported
into the Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas service areas and
enhance competitive power supply options in the service areas. The construction
of these projects will occur over the next two to three years. In conjunction
with the Interim FERC Mitigation, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy
Carolinas entered into power sale agreements with various counterparties that
were effective with the consummation of the merger. These agreements, or
similar power sale agreements, will be in place until the Long-term FERC
Mitigation is operational. Under the agreements Duke Energy will deliver
around-the-clock power during the winter and summer in quantities that vary by
season and by peak period.  

  The FERC order
requires an independent party to monitor whether the power sale agreements
remain in effect during construction of the transmission projects and provide
quarterly reports to the FERC regarding the status of construction of the
transmission projects.

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

On
June 25, 2012, Duke Energy and Progress Energy accepted the conditions imposed
by the FERC.  

  On July 10, 2012,
certain intervenors requested a rehearing seeking to overturn the June 8, 2012
order by the FERC. On August 8, 2012, FERC granted rehearing for further
consideration.  

    North Carolina
Utilities Commission and Public Service Commission of South
Carolina.    
In September 2011, Duke Energy and Progress Energy reached settlements with the
Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NC Public Staff) and
the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS) and certain other
interested parties in connection with the regulatory proceedings related to the
merger, the JDA and the OATT that were pending before the NCUC and PSCSC. These
settlements were updated in May 2012 to reflect the results of ongoing merger
related applications pending before the FERC.   

  On June 29, 2012, the NCUC
approved the merger application and the JDA application. On July 2, 2012, the
PSCSC approved the JDA application subject to Duke Energy Carolinas and
Progress Energy Carolinas providing their South Carolina retail customers pro
rata benefits equivalent to those approved by the NCUC in its merger approval
order.  

  On July 6, 2012, the
NCUC issued an order initiating investigation and scheduling hearings on the
Duke Energy board of directors  decision on July 2, 2012, to replace William D.
Johnson with James E. Rogers as President and CEO of Duke Energy subsequent to
the merger close, as well as other related matters. On November 29, 2012, a
settlement agreement was reached and was subsequently approved by the NCUC on
December 3, 2012. See Note 4 for further information.  

  As part of these
settlements, approval of the merger by the NCUC and PSCSC, and resolution of
the subsequent investigation by the NCUC, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress
Energy Carolinas agreed to the conditions and obligations listed below.  

Guarantee
of $687 million in system fuel and fuel-related savings over 60 to 78 months
for North Carolina and South Carolina retail and wholesale customers. The
savings are expected to be achieved through coal blending, coal commodity and
transportation savings, gas transportation savings, and the joint dispatch of
Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas generation fleets.  

Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas will not seek recovery from
retail customers for the cost of the Long-term FERC Mitigation for five years
following merger consummation. After five years, Duke Energy Carolinas and
Progress Energy Carolinas may seek to recover the costs of the Long-term FERC
Mitigation, but must show that the projects are needed to provide adequate and
reliable retail service regardless of the merger.  

A
$65 million rate reduction over the term of the Interim FERC Mitigation to
reflect the cost of capacity not available to Duke Energy Carolinas and
Progress Energy Carolinas wholesale and retail customers during the Interim
FERC Mitigation. The rate reduction will be achieved through retail decrement
riders apportioned between Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas
retail customers.  

Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas will not seek recovery from
retail customers for any revenue shortfalls or fuel-related costs associated
with the Interim FERC Mitigation. The Interim FERC Mitigation agreements were
in a loss position for Duke Energy as of the date of the merger consummation.  

Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas will not seek recovery from
retail customers for any revenue shortfalls or fuel-related costs associated
with the Interim FERC Mitigation.  

Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas will not seek recovery from
retail customers for any of their allocable share of merger related severance
costs.  

Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas will provide community support
and charitable contributions for four years, workforce development, low income
energy assistance, and funding for green energy at a total cost of
approximately $105 million, which cannot be recovered from retail customers.  

Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas will abide by revised North
Carolina Regulatory Conditions and Code of Conduct governing their operations.  

Duke
Energy will make certain management personnel changes and create a special
committee of the Board of Directors to oversee the recommendation of a
successor to James E. Rogers, President and CEO, and the search for two new
members of the Board of Directors (see Note 4 for further information).  

    Kentucky Public
Service Commission.     On June 24, 2011, Duke Energy and Progress Energy filed
a settlement agreement with the Kentucky Attorney General. On August 2, 2011,
the KPSC issued an order conditionally approving the merger and required Duke
Energy and Progress Energy to accept all conditions contained in the order.
Duke Energy and Progress Energy requested and were granted rehearing on the
limited issue of the wording of one condition relating to the composition of
Duke Energy s post-merger board of directors. On October 28, 2011, the KPSC
issued its order approving a settlement with the Kentucky Attorney General on
the revised condition relating to the composition of the post-merger Duke
Energy board. Duke Energy and Progress Energy filed their acceptance of the
condition on November 2, 2011. Duke Energy Kentucky agreed to (i) not file new
gas or electric base rate applications for two years from the date of the
KPSC s final order in the merger proceedings, (ii) make five annual shareholder
contributions of $165,000 to support low-income weatherization efforts and
economic development within Duke Energy Kentucky s service territory and (iii) not
seek recovery from retail customers for any of their allocable share of merger
related costs.  

    Accounting Charges Related to the Merger
Consummation    

  The
following pre-tax consummation charges were recognized upon closing of the
merger and are included in the Duke Energy Registrant s Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2012  .

PROGRESS ENERY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC. - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA,

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

The FERC Mitigation
charges reflect the portion of transmission project costs that were probable of
disallowance, the impairment of the carrying value of the generation assets
serving the Interim FERC Mitigation, and the mark-to-market loss recognized on
the power sale agreements upon closing of the merger. The charges related to
the transmission projects and the impairment of the carrying value of
generation assets were recorded within Impairment charges in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. The
mark-to-market loss on the interim power sale agreements was recorded in
Regulated electric operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. Subsequent changes in the fair
value of the interim power sale agreements over the life of the contracts and realized
gains or losses on the interim contract sales are also recorded within
Regulated electric operating revenues. The ability to successfully defend
future recovery of a portion of the transmission projects in rates and any
future changes to estimated transmission project costs could impact the amount
that is not expected to be recovered.  

  In conjunction with
the merger, in November 2011, Duke Energy and Progress Energy each offered a
voluntary severance plan (VSP) to certain eligible employees. VSP and other
severance costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2012, were recorded
primarily within Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. See Note 21 for further
information related to employee severance expenses.   

  Community support,
charitable contributions and other reflect (i) the unconditional obligation to
provide funding at a level comparable to historic practices over the next four
years, and (ii) financial and legal advisory costs that were incurred upon the
closing of the merger, retention and relocation costs paid to certain
employees. These charges were recorded within Operation, maintenance and other
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31,
2012.  

    Purchase Price    

  Pursuant
to the merger, all Progress Energy common shares were exchanged at the fixed
exchange ratio of 0.87083 common shares of Duke Energy for each Progress Energy
common share. The total consideration transferred in the merger was based on
the closing price of Duke Energy common shares on July 2, 2012, and was
calculated as follows:   

Progress
Energy s stock-based compensation awards, including performance shares and restricted
stock, were replaced with Duke Energy awards upon consummation of the merger.
In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, a portion of
the fair value of these awards is included in the purchase price as it
represents consideration transferred in the merger.  

    Purchase Price Allocation    

  The fair value of
Progress Energy s assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined based
on significant estimates and assumptions, including level 3 inputs, which are
judgmental in nature. The estimates and assumptions include the projected timing
and amount of future cash flows; discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the
future cash flows and future market prices. The fair value of Progress Energy s
assets acquired and liabilities assumed utilized for the purchase price
allocation are preliminary. These amounts are subject to revision until the
valuations are completed, and to the extent that additional information is
obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition
date, including but not limited to the resolution of matters pertaining to the
retirement of CR3 as well as certain other tax and contingency related items.  

  The significant assets
and liabilities for which preliminary valuation amounts are reflected as of the
filing of this Form 10-K include the fair value of the acquired long-term debt,
asset retirement obligations, capital leases and pension and other
post-retirement benefit (OPEB) plans. Additionally the February 5, 2013
announcement of the decision to retire Progress Energy Florida s Crystal River
Unit 3, reflects additional information related to the facts and circumstances
that existed as of the acquisition date. See Note 4 for additional information
related to Crystal River Unit 3. As such, the Progress Energy assets acquired
and liabilities assumed are presented as if the retirement of Crystal River
Unit 3 occurred on the acquisition date. The fair value of the outstanding
stock compensation awards is included in the purchase price as consideration
transferred.   

  The majority of Progress
Energy s operations are subject to the rate-setting authority of the FERC, the
NCUC, the PSCSC, and the FPSC and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. GAAP,
including the accounting guidance for regulated operations. The rate-setting
and cost recovery provisions currently in place for Progress Energy s regulated
operations provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on

investment of assets and liabilities included in rate
base. Except for long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, capital leases, pension
and OPEB plans and the wholesale portion of Progress Energy Florida s Crystal
River Unit 3, the fair values of Progress Energy s tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximate
their carrying values, and the assets and liabilities acquired and pro forma
financial information do not reflect any net adjustments related to these
amounts. The difference between fair value and the pre-merger carrying amounts
for Progress Energy s long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, capital
leases and pension and OPEB plans for the regulated operations were recorded as
Regulatory assets.   

  The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill at the acquisition date. The
goodwill reflects the value paid primarily for the long-term potential for
enhanced access to capital as a result of the company s increased scale and
diversity, opportunities for synergies, and an improved risk profile. The
goodwill resulting from Duke Energy s merger with Progress Energy was
preliminarily allocated entirely to the USFE G segment, but is subject to
change as additional information is obtained. None of the goodwill recognized
is deductible for income tax purposes, and as such, no deferred taxes have been
recorded related to goodwill.  

  The preliminary
purchase price allocation of the merger is presented in the following table.   

The preliminary
purchase price allocation in the table above reflects refinements made to the
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed since the
acquisition date and also reflects the retirement of Progress Energy Florida s
Crystal River Unit 3 as if it occurred on the acquisition date. These resulted
in an increase to the fair value of Other long-term assets, excluding goodwill
of $1,845 million, an increase in Current liabilities of $14 million and an
increase in Long-term liabilities, preferred stock and noncontrolling interests
of $232 million. The fair value of Current assets decreased by $54 million and
Property, plant and equipment decreased by $1,670 million. These changes to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in an increase to goodwill of
$125 million and had an immaterial impact on the amortization of the purchase
accounting adjustments recorded during 2012.   

    Pro Forma Financial Information    

  The
following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated
results of operations of Duke Energy and reflects the amortization of purchase
price adjustments assuming the merger had taken place on January 1, 2011. The
unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of
operations that would have been achieved or the future consolidated results of
operations of Duke Energy. This information is preliminary in nature and
subject to change based on final purchase price adjustments.  

  Non-recurring
merger consummation, integration and other costs incurred by Duke Energy and
Progress Energy during the period have been excluded from the pro forma
earnings presented below. After-tax non-recurring merger consummation,
integration and other costs incurred by both Duke Energy and Progress Energy
were $413 million and $85 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2011, respectively. The pro forma financial information also excludes potential
future cost savings or non-recurring charges related to the merger.   

Chilean Operations   

  In December 2012,
International Energy acquired Iberoamericana de Energ a Ibener, S.A. (Ibener)
of Santiago, Chile for cash consideration of $415 million. This
acquisition included the 140 MW Duqueco hydroelectric generation complex
consisting of two run-of-the-river plants located in southern Chile
vicinity. The preliminary purchase accounting entries consisted primarily
of $383 million of property, plant and equipment, $30 million of intangible
assets, $57 million of deferred income tax liabilities, and $59 million of
goodwill. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
utilized for the purchase price allocation are preliminary and subject to revision
until the valuations are completed and to the extent that additional information
is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, a $190 million six-month
bridge loan and a $200 million revolving loan under a credit agreement were
executed with a commercial bank.  Both loans are collateralized with cash
deposits equal to 101% of the loan amounts, and therefore no net proceeds from
the financings exist as of December 31, 2012. The $190 million bridge loan
is classified in Current maturities of long-term debt and the related cash
collateral deposit is classified as Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as of December 31, 2012.  The $200 million, fully
cash-collateralized revolving loan is due on December 20, 2013 and
International Energy has the right to extend the term for additional 1 year
terms, not to exceed a final maturity of 13 years from the date of the initial
funding. The revolving loan is classified as Long-

Dispositions

In December 2010, Duke
Energy completed the previously announced agreement with investment funds
managed by Alinda to sell a   50  % ownership interest in DukeNet Communications,
LLC (DukeNet). As a result of the disposition transaction, DukeNet and Alinda
became equal 50% owners in the new joint venture. Duke Energy received $137
million in cash. The DukeNet disposition transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain
of $139 million, which was recorded in Gains on Sales of Other Assets and
Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The pre-tax gain
reflects the gain on the disposition of Duke Energy s 50% interest in DukeNet,
as well as the gain resulting from the re-measurement to fair value of Duke
Energy s retained noncontrolling interest. Effective with the closing of the
DukeNet disposition transaction, on December 20, 2010, DukeNet is no
longer consolidated into Duke Energy s consolidated financial statements and is
now accounted for by Duke Energy as an equity method investment.   

Vermillion Generating
Station    

  On January 12, 2012,
after receiving approvals from the FERC and the IURC on August 12, 2011 and
December 28, 2011, respectively, Duke Energy Vermillion II, LLC (Duke Energy
Vermillion), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, completed
the sale of its 75% undivided ownership interest in the Vermillion Generating
Station (Vermillion) to Duke Energy Indiana and Wabash Valley Power Association
(WVPA). Upon the closing of the sale, Duke Energy Indiana and WVPA held 62.5%
and 37.5% interests in Vermillion, respectively. Duke Energy Ohio received net proceeds
of $82 million, consisting of $  68   million and $14 million from Duke Energy Indiana
and WVPA, respectively. Following the transaction, Duke Energy Indiana retired
Gallagher Units 1 and 3 effective February 1, 2012.   

  As Duke Energy Indiana
is an affiliate of Duke Energy Vermillion the transaction has been accounted
for as a transfer between entities under common control with no gain or loss
recorded and did not have a significant impact to Duke Energy Ohio or Duke
Energy Indiana s results of operations. The proceeds received from Duke Energy
Indiana are included in Net proceeds from the sales of other assets on Duke
Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The cash paid to Duke
Energy Ohio is included in Capital expenditures on Duke Energy Indiana s
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana
recognized non-cash equity transfers of $28 million and $26 million,
respectively, in their Consolidated Statements of Common Stockholder s Equity
on the transaction representing the difference between cash exchanged and the
net book value of Vermillion. These amounts are not reflected in Duke Energy s Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows or Consolidated Statements of Equity as the
transaction is eliminated in consolidation.   

  The proceeds from WVPA
are included in Net proceeds from the sales of other assets, and sale of and
collections on notes receivable on Duke Energy and Duke Energy Ohio s
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the second quarter of 2011, Duke
Energy Ohio recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $9 million to adjust the
carrying value of the proportionate share of Vermillion to be sold to WVPA to
the proceeds to be received from WVPA less costs to sell. The sale of the
proportionate share of Vermillion to WVPA did not result in a significant
additional gain or loss upon close of the transaction.  

   Wind Projects Joint
Venture    

  In April 2012, Duke
Energy executed a joint venture agreement with Sumitomo Corporation of America
(SCOA). Under the terms of the agreement, Duke Energy and SCOA each own a 50%
interest in the joint venture (DS Cornerstone, LLC), which owns two wind
generation projects. The facilities began commercial operations in June 2012
and August 2012. Duke Energy and SCOA also negotiated a $330 million,
Construction and 12-year amortizing Term Loan Facility, on behalf of the
borrower, a wholly owned subsidiary of the joint venture. The loan agreement is
non-recourse to Duke Energy. Duke Energy received proceeds of $319 million upon
execution of the loan agreement. This amount represents reimbursement of a
significant portion of Duke Energy s construction costs incurred as of the date
of the agreement. See Note 18 for further information.

Discontinued
Operations   

Included in Income
From Discontinued Operations, net of tax on the Consolidated Statements of Operations
are amounts related to adjustments for prior sales of diversified businesses.
These adjustments are generally due to indemnifications provided for certain
legal, tax and environmental matters. See Note 7 for further discussion of
indemnifications. The ultimate resolution of these matters could result in
additional adjustments in future periods.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS    

Effective with the first quarter of 2012,
management began evaluating segment performance based on Segment Income.
Segment Income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income
attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment Income, as discussed below,
includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. In conjunction with management s use of the
new reporting measure, certain governance costs that were previously
unallocated have now been allocated to each   of the segments. In addition, direct
interest expense and income taxes are included in Segment Income. Prior year
segment profitability information has been recast to conform to the current
year presentation. None of these changes impacts the reportable operating
segments  or the Duke Energy Registrants  previously reported consolidated revenues,
net income or earnings per share.  

  Operating segments for
each of the Duke Energy Registrants are determined based on information used by
the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and
evaluate the performance at each of the Duke Energy Registrants.   

  Products and services
are sold between the affiliate companies and between the reportable segments of
Duke Energy at cost. Segment assets as presented in the tables that follow
exclude all intercompany assets.  

   Duke Energy    

  Duke Energy has the
following reportable operating segments: U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas
(USFE G), Commercial Power and International Energy.   

  USFE G
generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity in North Carolina,
South Carolina, west central Florida, central, north central and southern
Indiana, and northern Kentucky. USFE G also transmits and distributes
electricity in southwestern Ohio. Additionally, USFE G transports and sells
natural gas in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. It conducts operations
primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress
Energy Florida, certain regulated portions of Duke Energy Ohio, and Duke
Energy Indiana. Segment information for USFE G for the year ended December
31, 2012, includes the results of the regulated operations of Progress Energy
from July 2, 2012 forward.  

  Commercial
Power owns, operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale
marketing and procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances
related to these plants, as well as other contractual positions. Commercial
Power also has a retail sales subsidiary, Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC (Duke
Energy Retail), which is certified by the PUCO as a Competitive Retail Electric
Service provider in Ohio. Through Duke Energy Generation Services, Inc. and its
affiliates (DEGS), Commercial Power engages in the development, construction
and operation of renewable energy projects. In addition, DEGS develops
commercial transmission projects.   

  International
Energy principally operates and manages power generation facilities and engages
in sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas outside the U.S. It
conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy International, LLC and its
affiliates and its activities principally target power generation in Latin
America. Additionally, International Energy owns a 25% interest in National
Methanol Company, located in Saudi Arabia, which is a large regional producer
of methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether.   

  The
remainder of Duke Energy s operations is presented as Other. While it is not
considered an operating segment, Other primarily includes unallocated corporate
costs, which include costs not allocable to Duke Energy s reportable business
segments, primarily interest expense on corporate debt instruments, costs to
achieve mergers and divestitures, and costs associated with certain corporate
severance programs. It also includes Bison Insurance Company Limited (Bison),
Duke Energy s wholly owned, captive insurance subsidiary, Duke Energy s 50%
interest in DukeNet and related telecommunications businesses, and Duke
Energy s 60% interest in Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC.

Energy    

  Effective with the
consummation of the merger with Duke Energy on July 2, 2012, Progress Energy s
reportable segments changed based on the financial information the chief
decision maker evaluates for the allocation of resources and assessing
performance. Progress Energy s sole reportable segment is now Franchised
Electric, which is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina, South
Carolina and Florida. These electric operations also distribute and sell electricity
to other utilities, primarily on the east coast of the United States. The
remainder of Progress Energy s operations is presented as Other. While it is
not considered an operating segment, Other primarily includes the Progress
Energy holding company and Progress Energy Service Company, LLC and other
miscellaneous nonregulated businesses, as well as costs to achieve the merger
with Duke Energy and certain governance costs allocated by its parent, Duke
Energy. See Note 14 for additional information. Also effective with the
consummation of the merger, management began evaluating segment performance
based on Segment Income. Segment Income is defined as income from continuing
operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  

  Prior periods  segment
information has been recast to conform to the current year presentation. None
of these segment changes impact Progress Energy s previously reported
consolidated net income.

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

Descriptions of the
regulatory assets and liabilities summarized in the tables above, as well as
their recovery and amortization periods are as follows. Items are excluded from
rate base unless otherwise noted.  

    Vacation accrual.     Vacation is accrued as it is earned by
employees and generally recovered as it is paid, generally within one year.
This includes both accrued vacation and personal holiday pay.   

    Nuclear deferral.     In 2009, pursuant to
the FPSC nuclear cost-recovery rule, Progress Energy Florida filed a petition
to recover costs, which primarily consisted of preconstruction and carrying
costs incurred or anticipated to be incurred during 2009 and the projected 2010
costs associated with the Levy project. In an effort to help mitigate the
initial price impact on its customers, as part of its filing, Progress Energy
Florida recorded
this asset, and it was to be recovered or amortized, as approved by the FPSC,
over a period not exceeding five years. These costs are projected to be recovered
by the end of 2014. This amount also includes deferred depreciation expense
related to Crystal River Unit 3 as a result of the 2012 FPSC settlement
agreement.  

    DSM Costs/EE.     These amounts
represent costs recoverable or refundable under the Duke Energy Registrants 
Demand Side Management programs, various state Energy Efficiency programs,
SmartGrid, and other peak time energy management programs. The recovery period
varies for these costs, with some currently unknown. Duke Energy Carolinas and
Progress Energy Florida are required to pay interest on the outstanding
liability balance, and Progress Energy Florida collects interest on the
outstanding asset balance.  

    Deferred fuel costs.     Deferred fuel costs
represent certain energy costs that are recoverable or refundable as approved
by the applicable regulatory body. Interest is earned on under-recovered costs
and interest is paid on over-recovered costs to customers.   

  For Progress Energy
Florida, as a result of the 2012 FPSC settlement agreement, the FPSC approved
an agreement between Progress Energy Florida and consumer advocates in Florida
that provides customers a refund through the fuel clause, relating to the
Crystal River Unit 3 delamination and subsequent outage.  The amounts for
Progress Energy Florida are reduced by this refund.  

    Over-distribution of BPM
sharing.    
These costs represent Duke Energy Carolinas  BPM sharing requirements by the
NCUC.  The NCUC requires a percentage of the profits on the wholesale market to
be shared with retail customers.  Under the BPM rider, Duke Energy Carolinas is
required to true-up any differences, and as a result, the over-distribution to
retail customers is recorded as a regulatory asset. The recovery period for
these costs is generally one year, and Duke Energy Carolinas earns a return on
the balance.    

    Post-in-service
carrying costs and deferred operating expenses.     These costs represent
deferred depreciation and operating expenses as well as carrying costs on the
portion of assets of the Duke Energy Registrants  capital expenditure programs
that are placed in service but not yet reflected in rates as plant in service. 
Duke Energy Carolinas is allowed to earn a return on the North Carolina portion
of the outstanding balance, but does not earn a return on the South Carolina
portion. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are allowed to earn a return
on the outstanding balance. Duke Energy Carolinas amounts are excluded from
rate base and Duke Energy Ohio amounts are included in rate base. At Duke
Energy Indiana, some amounts are included in and some are excluded from rate
base. Recovery is over various lives, and the latest recovery period for these
costs is 2067.  

    Gasification services
agreement buyout costs.       In 1999, Duke Energy Indiana
entered into a buyout of a gasification services agreement.  The IURC
authorized Duke Energy Indiana to recover costs incurred, including carrying
costs on the unrecovered balance, over an 18-year period. Duke Energy
Indiana earns a return on the balance, and the recovery period lasts through
2018.  

    Accrued pension and
post-retirement.    
Accrued pension and other post-retirement benefits represent regulatory assets
related to the recognition of each of the Duke Energy Registrants  respective
shares of the underfunded status of Duke Energy and Progress Energy s defined
benefit and other post-retirement plans as a liability on each registrant s
balance sheet. The regulatory asset is amortized in proportion to the
recognition of prior service costs (gains), transition obligations and
actuarial losses attributable to Duke Energy and Progress Energy s pension plans
and other post-retirement benefit plans determined by the cost recognition
provisions of the accounting guidance for pensions and post-retirement benefits.
See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, for additional detail.   

    Retired generation
facilities.     
These amounts represent the net book value of Duke Energy facilities that have
been retired. Duke Energy Indiana earns a return on the outstanding balances
and the costs are included in rate base. Progress Energy Carolinas anticipates
earning a return on the outstanding balance with the costs excluded from rate
base. For Duke Energy Indiana, the recovery period is through 2026.  For
Progress Energy Carolinas, the recovery period is over the previously estimated
lives of the units.   

    Debt fair value
adjustment.     These
costs represent purchase accounting adjustments as a result of the merger with
Progress Energy in July 2012 to restate the carrying value of existing debt to
fair value. The increase in the carrying value of the debt is due to a general
reduction in interest rates since the underlying debt was issued. Since the
debt is reflected in capital structure for rate setting purposes at its
original carrying value and interest rate, the increase in the carrying value
of the debt is recorded to a regulatory asset.   

    Asset retirement
obligations.     These
costs represent future removal costs associated with the Duke Energy
Registrants  existing asset retirement obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants
do not earn a return on these balances. The recovery period trends with the
expiration of the COL for each nuclear unit, the latest of which is 2043. See
Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations, for additional information.    

    Net regulatory asset
related to income taxes.     These costs represent the difference between the
regulatory accounting of income taxes and the GAAP accounting of income taxes.
Regulatory assets and liabilities associated with deferred income taxes, recorded
in compliance with the accounting guidance for certain types of regulation and
income taxes, include the deferred tax effects associated principally with
depreciation of AFUDC equity accounted for in accordance with the ratemaking
policies of the respective regulatory bodies, as well as the revenue impacts,
and assume continued recovery of these costs in future transmission and
distribution rates. A portion of these costs are included in rate base as a
reduction of deferred income taxes and the recovery period is over the life of
the associated assets.   

    Hedge costs and other
deferrals.    
These costs are r  elated to unrealized gains and
losses on derivatives that are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability,
respectively, until the contracts are settled.   The recovery period varies
for these costs, with some currently unknown.

RTO
costs.    
Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas RTO costs reflect those
from GridSouth, while those from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are
related to the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO). These
amounts reduce rate base and the liability for the removal costs is
extinguished as the related removal costs are incurred.    

    MGP costs.     These costs represent
remediation costs for Duke Energy Ohio s former MGP sites. Duke Energy Ohio has
requested recovery of these costs in its currently pending gas distribution
rate case. If the costs are deemed to be recoverable through rates, the period
of recovery will be related to the timing of the actual cleanup expenditures
and is unknown at this time. Duke Energy Ohio does not earn a return on these
costs. See Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information.

Removal
costs.     These amounts represent funds the Duke Energy Registrants have
received from customers to cover the future removal of property, plant and
equipment from retired or abandoned sites which reduces rate base for
ratemaking purposes. These costs are included in rate base, and the liability
for removal costs is extinguished over the life of the associated asset.  

    Amounts to be refunded
to customers.     These
amounts represent required refunds to retail customers by the applicable
regulatory body. The refund period is through 2016 for Progress Energy Florida
and through 2017 for Duke Energy Indiana.  

    Storm reserve.     Progress Energy
Florida is allowed to petition the FPSC to seek recovery of named storms under
the 2012 FPSC settlement agreement. Recovery from customers will begin, subject
the FPSC approval, 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition and
will be based on a 12-month recovery period.  

Restrictions
on the Ability of Certain Subsidiaries to Make Dividends, Advances and Loans to
Duke Energy    

As a
condition to the Duke Energy and Cinergy Corp. (Cinergy) merger approval, the NCUC,
the PSCSC, the PUCO, the KPSC, and the IURC imposed conditions (the Cinergy Merger
Conditions) on the ability of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke
Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana to transfer funds to Duke Energy
through loans or advances, as well as restricted amounts available to pay
dividends to Duke Energy. As a condition to the Duke Energy and Progress Energy
merger approval, the NCUC and the PSCSC imposed conditions (the Progress Merger
Conditions) on the ability of Duke Energy Carolinas, and Progress Energy
Carolinas to transfer funds to Duke Energy through loans or advances, as well
as restricted amounts available to pay dividends to Duke Energy.   

  Duke
Energy s public utility subsidiaries may not transfer funds to the parent
through intercompany loans or advances; however, certain subsidiaries may
transfer funds to the parent by obtaining approval of the respective state
regulatory commissions. These conditions imposed restrictions on the ability of
the public utility subsidiaries to pay cash dividends as discussed below.   

  Progress
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by
their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation which, in
certain circumstances, limited their ability to make cash dividends or
distributions on common stock. Amounts restricted as a result of these
provisions were not material at December 31, 2012.  

  Additionally,
certain other subsidiaries of Duke Energy have restrictions on their ability to
dividend, loan or advance funds to Duke Energy due to specific legal or
regulatory restrictions, including, but not limited to, minimum working capital
and tangible net worth requirements.   

   Duke Energy Carolinas   

   Under both the Cinergy
Merger Conditions and Progress Merger Conditions, Duke Energy Carolinas must
limit cumulative distributions to Duke Energy subsequent to the merger to
(i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the
merger, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded by Duke Energy Carolinas
subsequent to the merger.   

   Progress Energy Carolinas   

   Under the Progress
Merger Conditions, Progress Energy Carolinas must limit cumulative
distributions to Duke Energy subsequent to the merger to (i) the amount of
retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the merger, plus
(ii) any future earnings recorded by Progress Energy Carolinas subsequent
to the merger.   

   Duke Energy Ohio   

   Under the Cinergy Merger
Conditions, Duke Energy Ohio will not declare and pay dividends out of capital
or unearned surplus without the prior authorization of the PUCO. In November
2011, the FERC approved, with conditions, Duke Energy Ohio s request to pay
dividends from its equity accounts that are reflective of the amount that it
would have in its retained earnings account had push-down accounting for the
Cinergy merger not been applied to Duke Energy Ohio s balance sheet. The
conditions include a commitment from Duke Energy Ohio that equity, adjusted to
remove the impacts of push-down accounting, will not fall below 30% of total
capital. In January 2012, the PUCO issued an order approving the payment of
dividends in a manner consistent with the method approved in the November 2011
FERC order. Under the Merger Conditions, Duke Energy Kentucky is required to
pay dividends solely out of retained earnings and to maintain a minimum of 35%
equity in its capital structure.   

   Duke Energy Indiana   

   Under the Cinergy Merger
Conditions, Duke Energy Indiana shall limit cumulative distributions paid subsequent
to the merger to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to
the closing of the merger plus (ii) any future earnings recorded by Duke
Energy Indiana subsequent to the merger. In addition, Duke Energy Indiana will
not declare and pay dividends out of capital or unearned surplus without prior
authorization of the IURC.

well as sales of transmission service.   

   Duke Energy Carolinas   

   2013 North Carolina
Rate Case.    On
February 4, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for
an increase in base rates of approximately $446 million, or an average 9.7%
increase in retail revenues. The request for increase is based upon an 11.25%
return on equity and a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% long-term debt.
The rate increase is designed primarily to recover the cost of plant
modernization, environmental compliance and the capital additions.  

  Duke Energy Carolinas
expects revised rates, if approved, to go into effect late third quarter of
2013.   

   2011 North Carolina
Rate Case.    On
January 27, 2012, the NCUC approved a settlement agreement between Duke
Energy Carolinas and the North Carolina Utilities Public Staff (Public Staff).
The terms of the agreement include an average 7.2% increase in retail revenues,
or approximately $309 million annually beginning in February 2012. The
agreement includes a 10.5% return on equity and a capital structure of 53%
equity and 47% long-term debt.   

  On March 28, 2012, the
North Carolina Attorney General filed a notice of appeal with the NCUC
challenging the rate of return approved in the agreement. On April 17, 2012,
the NCUC denied Duke Energy Carolinas  request to dismiss the notice of appeal.
Briefs were filed on August 22, 2012 by the North Carolina Attorney General and
the AARP with the North Carolina Supreme Court, which is hearing the appeal.
Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on August 31, 2012
and the North Carolina Attorney General filed a response to that motion on
September 13, 2012. Briefs by the appellees, Duke Energy Carolinas and the
Public Staff, were filed on September 21, 2012. The North Carolina Supreme
Court denied Duke Energy Carolinas  motion to dismiss on procedural grounds and
oral arguments were held on November 13, 2012. Duke Energy Carolinas is
awaiting an order.  

   2011 South Carolina
Rate Case.    On
January 25, 2012, the PSCSC approved a settlement agreement between Duke Energy
Carolinas and the ORS, Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, and Sam s East, Inc. The
Commission of Public Works for the city of Spartanburg, South Carolina and the
Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer District were not parties to the agreement; however,
they did not object to the agreement. The terms of the agreement include an
average 5.98% increase in retail and commercial revenues, or approximately $93
million annually beginning February 6, 2012. The agreement includes a 10.5%
return on equity, a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% long-term debt.   

   Cliffside Unit 6.    On March 21, 2007, the
NCUC issued an order allowing Duke Energy Carolinas to build an 800 MW
coal-fired unit. Following final equipment selection and the completion of
detailed engineering, Cliffside Unit 6 has a net output of 825 MW. On January 31,
2008, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its updated cost estimate of $1.8 billion
(excluding AFUDC of $600 million) for Cliffside Unit 6. In March 2010, Duke
Energy Carolinas filed an update to the cost estimate of $1.8 billion
(excluding AFUDC) with the NCUC where it reduced the estimated AFUDC financing
costs to $400 million as a result of the December 2009 rate case settlement
with the NCUC that allowed the inclusion of construction work in progress in
rate base prospectively. Cliffside Unit 6 began commercial operation in
the fourth quarter of 2012.   

   Dan River Combined
Cycle Facility.    In
June 2008, the NCUC issued its order approving the Certificate of Public
Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) applications to construct a 620 MW combined
cycle natural gas fired generating facility at Duke Energy Carolinas  existing
Dan River Steam Station. The Division of Air Quality (DAQ) issued a final air
permit authorizing construction of the Dan River combined cycle natural
gas-fired generating unit in August 2009. Dan River began commercial operation in
the fourth quarter of 2012.  

   William States Lee III
Nuclear Station.    In
December 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NRC,
which has been docketed for review, for a combined Construction and Operating
License (COL) for two Westinghouse AP1000 (advanced passive) reactors for the
proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station (Lee Nuclear Station) at a site
in Cherokee County, South Carolina. Each reactor is capable of producing 1,117
MW. Submitting the COL application does not commit Duke Energy Carolinas to
build nuclear units. Through several separate orders, the NCUC and PSCSC have concurred
with the prudency of Duke Energy incurring project development and
pre-construction costs.   

   V.C. Summer Nuclear
Station Letter of Intent.    In July 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas signed a letter of
intent with Santee Cooper related to the potential acquisition by Duke Energy
Carolinas of a 5% to 10% ownership interest in the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station
being developed by Santee Cooper and SCE G near Jenkinsville, South
Carolina. The letter of intent provides a path for Duke Energy Carolinas to
conduct the necessary due diligence to determine if future participation in
this project is beneficial for its customers. On November 7, 2012, the term of
the letter of intent expired, though Duke Energy Carolinas remains engaged in
discussions at this time.

2012
North Carolina Rate Case.    On October 12, 2012, Progress Energy Carolinas filed an
application with the NCUC for an increase in base rates of approximately $387
million, or an average 12% increase in revenues. The request for increase is
based upon an 11.25% return on equity and a capital structure of 55% equity and
45% long-term debt. The rate increase is designed primarily to recover the cost
of plant modernization and other capital investments in generation,
transmission and distribution systems, as well as increased expenditures for
nuclear plants and personnel, vegetation management and other operating costs.
The rate case includes a corresponding decrease in Progress Energy Carolinas 
energy efficiency and demand side management rider, resulting in a net
requested increase of $359 million, or 11% increase in retail revenues.   

  On February 25,
2013, the North Carolina Public Staff filed with the NCUC a Notice of Settlement
in Principle (Settlement Notice). Pursuant to the Settlement Notice between
Progress Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff, the parties have agreed to a
two year step-in to a total agreed upon net rate increase, with the first year
providing for a $151 million, or 4.7% average increase in rates, and the second
year providing for rates to be increased by an additional $31 million, or 1.0%
average increase in rates.  This second year increase is a result of
Progress Energy Carolinas agreeing to delay collection of financing costs on
the construction work in progress for the Sutton combined cycle natural gas
plant for one year.  The Settlement Notice is based upon a return on
equity of 10.2% and a 53% equity component of the capital structure.    

  Once filed, the actual
settlement agreement will be subject to approval by the NCUC. Progress Energy
Carolinas expects revised rates, if approved, to go into effect June 1, 2013.   

   HF Lee and L.V. Sutton
Combined Cycle Facilities.    Progress Energy Carolinas has been constructing two new
generating facilities, which consist of an approximately 920 MW combined cycle
natural gas-fired generating facility at the HF Lee Energy Complex (Lee) in
Wayne County, North Carolina, and an approximately 625 MW natural gas-fired
generating facility at its existing L.V. Sutton Steam Station (Sutton) in New
Hanover County, North Carolina. The Lee project began commercial operation in
the fourth quarter of 2012. Total estimated costs at final project completion
(including AFUDC) for the Sutton project, which is approximately 64% complete, are
$600 million. Sutton is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of
2013.  

   Shearon Harris Nuclear
Station Expansion   .
In 2006, Progress Energy Carolinas selected a site at its existing Shearon Harris
Nuclear Station (Harris) to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion. On
February 19, 2008, Progress Energy Carolinas filed its COL application with the
NRC for two Westinghouse Electric AP1000 reactors at Harris, which the NRC
docketed on April 17, 2008. No petitions to intervene have been admitted in the
Harris COL application.  

Progress Energy Florida   

   2012 FPSC Settlement
Agreement.    On
February 22, 2012, the FPSC approved a comprehensive settlement agreement among
Progress Energy Florida, the Florida Office of Public Counsel and other
consumer advocates. The 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement will continue through
the last billing cycle of December 2016. The agreement addresses three
principal matters: (i) Progress Energy Florida s proposed Levy Nuclear Station
cost recovery, (ii) the Crystal River Nuclear Station   Unit 3 (Crystal River
Unit 3) delamination prudence review then pending before the FPSC, and (iii) certain
customer rate matters. Refer to each of these respective sections for further discussion.  

   Crystal River Unit 3.    In September 2009,
Crystal River Unit 3 began an outage for normal refueling and maintenance as
well as an uprate project to increase its generating capability and to replace
two steam generators. During preparations to replace the steam generators,
workers discovered a delamination (or separation) within the concrete at the
periphery of the containment building, which resulted in an extension of the
outage. After analysis, it was determined that the concrete delamination at
Crystal River Unit 3 was caused by redistribution of stresses in the
containment wall that occurred when an opening was created to accommodate the
replacement of the unit s steam generators. In March 2011, the work to return
the plant to service was suspended after monitoring equipment identified a new
delamination that occurred in a different section of the outer wall after the
repair work was completed and during the late stages of retensioning the
containment building. Crystal River Unit 3 has remained out of service while
Progress Energy Florida conducted an engineering analysis and review of the new
delamination and evaluated possible repair options.   

  Subsequent to March
2011, monitoring equipment has detected additional changes and further damage
in the partially tensioned containment building and additional cracking or
delaminations could occur.   

  Progress
Energy Florida developed a repair plan, which would entail systematically
removing and replacing concrete in substantial portions of the containment
structure walls, which had a preliminary cost estimate of $900 million to $1.3
billion.    

  In March
2012, Duke Energy commissioned an independent review team led by Zapata
Incorporated (Zapata) to review and assess the Progress Energy Florida Crystal
River Unit 3 repair plan, including the repair scope, risks, costs and
schedule. In its final report in late September, Zapata found that the proposed
repair scope appears to be technically feasible, but there were significant
risks that need to be addressed regarding the approach, construction
methodology, scheduling and licensing. Zapata performed four separate analyses
of the estimated project cost and schedule to repair Crystal River Unit 3,
including; (i) an independent review of the proposed repair scope (without
existing assumptions or data), of which Zapata estimated costs of $1.49 billion
with a project duration of 35 months; (ii) a review of Progress Energy
Florida s previous bid information, which included cost estimate data from
Progress Energy Florida, of which Zapata estimated costs of $1.55 billion with
a project duration of 31 months; (iii) an expanded scope of work scenario, that
included the Progress Energy Florida scope plus the replacement of the
containment building dome and the removal and replacement of concrete in the
lower building elevations, of which Zapata estimated costs of approximately
$2.44 billion with a project duration of 60 months, and; (iv) a  worst case 
scenario, assuming Progress Energy Florida performed the more limited scope of
work, and at the conclusion of that work, additional damage occurred in the
dome and in the lower elevations, which forced replacement of each, of which
Zapata estimated costs of $3.43 billion with a project duration of 96 months.
The principal difference between Zapata s estimate and Progress Energy
Florida s previous estimate appears to be due to the respective levels of
contingencies included by each party, including higher project risk and longer
project duration. Progress Energy Florida has filed a copy of the Zapata report
with the FPSC and with the NRC. The FPSC held a status conference on October
30, 2012 to discuss Duke Energy s analysis of the Zapata report.

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

On
February 5, 2013, following the completion of a comprehensive analysis, Duke
Energy announced its intention to retire Crystal River Unit 3. Duke Energy
concluded that it did not have a high degree of confidence that repair could be
successfully completed and licensed within estimated costs and schedule, and
that it was in the best interests of Progress Energy Florida s customers and
joint owners and Duke Energy s investors to retire the unit. Progress Energy
Florida developed initial estimates of the cost to decommission the plant
during its analysis of whether to repair or retire Crystal River Unit 3. With
the final decision to retire, Progress Energy Florida is working to develop a
comprehensive decommissioning plan, which will evaluate various decommissioning
options and costs associated with each option. The plan will determine resource
needs as well as the scope, schedule and other elements of decommissioning.
Progress Energy Florida intends to use a safe storage (SAFSTOR) option for
decommissioning. Generally, SAFSTOR involves placing the facility into a safe
storage configuration, requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions,
until the eventual dismantling and decontamination activities occur, usually in
40 to 60 years. This decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number
of retired domestic nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted
approaches to decommissioning required by the NRC. Once an updated site
specific decommissioning study is completed it will be filed with the FPSC. As
part of the evaluation of repairing Crystal River Unit 3, initial estimates of
the cost to decommission the plant under the SAFSTOR option were developed
which resulted in an estimate in 2011 dollars of $989 million. See Note 9 for
additional information. Additional specifics about the decommissioning plan are
being developed.  

  Progress
Energy Florida maintains insurance coverage against incremental costs of
replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages at Crystal River
Unit 3 through NEIL. NEIL provides insurance coverage for repair costs for
covered events, as well as the cost of replacement power of up to $490 million
per event when the unit is out of service as a result of these events. Actual
replacement power costs have exceeded the insurance coverage. Progress Energy
Florida also maintains insurance coverage through NEIL s accidental property
damage program, which provides insurance coverage up to $2.25 billion with a
$10 million deductible per claim.   

  Throughout
the duration of the Crystal River Unit 3 outage, Progress Energy Florida worked
with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement
power costs. NEIL has made payments on the first delamination; however, NEIL
has withheld payment of approximately $70 million of replacement power cost
claims and repair cost claims related to the first delamination event. NEIL had
not provided a written coverage decision for either delamination and no
payments were made on the second delamination and no replacement power
reimbursements were made by NEIL since May 2011. These considerations led
Progress Energy Florida to conclude, in the second quarter of 2012, that it was
not probable that NEIL would voluntarily pay the full coverage amounts that
Progress Energy Florida believes them to owe under the applicable insurance
policies. Consistent with the terms and procedures under the insurance coverage
with NEIL, Progress Energy Florida agreed to non-binding mediation prior to
commencing any formal dispute resolution. On February 5, 2013, Progress Energy
Florida announced it and NEIL had accepted the mediator s proposal whereby NEIL
will pay Progress Energy Florida an additional $530 million. Along with the
$305 million which NEIL previously paid, Progress Energy Florida will receive a
total of $835 million in insurance proceeds.

  assets on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Progress Energy
  Florida's Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012. Also, the $195 million of
  repair costs are classified within Regulatory assets on Duke Energy's
  Consolidated Balance Sheets and Progress Energy Florida's Balance Sheets as
  of December 31, 2012.  

As a
result of the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, Progress Energy Florida will be
permitted to recover prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs through
its fuel clause without regard for the absence of Crystal River Unit 3 for the
period from the beginning of the Crystal River Unit 3 outage through December
31, 2016.   

  In
accordance with the terms of the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, with consumer
representatives and approved by the FPSC, Progress Energy Florida retained the
sole discretion to retire Crystal River Unit 3. Progress Energy Florida expects
that the FPSC will review the prudence of the retirement decision in Phase 2 of
the Crystal River Unit 3 delamination regulatory docket. Progress Energy Florida
has also asked the FPSC to review the mediated resolution of insurance claims
with NEIL as part of Phase 3 of this regulatory docket.     Phase 2 and Phase 3
hearings have been tentatively scheduled to begin on June 19, 2013.  

  Progress Energy
Florida did not begin the repair of Crystal River Unit 3 prior to December 31,
2012. Consistent with the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement regarding the timing
of commencement of repairs, Progress Energy Florida recorded a Regulatory
liability of $100 million in the third quarter of 2012 related to replacement
power obligations. This amount is included within fuel used in electric
generation and purchased power in Progress Energy Florida s and Progress
Energy s Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended
December 31, 2012. Progress Energy Florida will refund this replacement power
liability on a pro rata basis based on the in-service date of up to $40 million
in 2015 and $60 million in 2016. This amount is reflected as part of the
purchase price allocation of the merger with Progress Energy in Duke Energy s
Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  Progress
Energy Florida also retained sole discretion to retire the unit without
challenge from the parties to the agreement. As a result, Progress Energy
Florida will be allowed to recover all remaining Crystal River Unit 3
investments and to earn a return on the Crystal River Unit 3 investments set at
its current authorized overall cost of capital, adjusted to reflect a return on
equity set at 70 percent of the current FPSC authorized return on equity, no
earlier than the first billing cycle of January 2017.

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

In conjunction with the decision to retire Crystal River
Unit 3, Progress Energy Florida reclassified all Crystal River Unit 3
investments, including property, plant and equipment; nuclear fuel; inventory;
and deferred assets to a regulatory asset account. At December 31, 2012,
Progress Energy Florida had $1,637 million of net investment in Crystal River
Unit 3 recorded in Regulatory assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. These
amounts are reflected in the Regulatory Assets and Liabilities tables presented
previously in this disclosure, of which $1,592 million is reflected as Retired
generation facilities, $25 million as Nuclear deferral and $20 million as an offset
to Removal costs. Progress Energy Florida recorded $192 million of impairment
and other charges related to the wholesale portion of Crystal River Unit 3
investments, which are not covered by the 2012 FSPC Settlement Agreement, and
other provisions. The significant majority of this amount is recorded in
Impairment charges on Progress Energy Florida s and Progress Energy s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year
ended December 31, 2012. This amount is reflected as part of the purchase price
allocation of the merger with Progress Energy in Duke Energy s Consolidated
Financial Statements (See Note 2).  

  In
accordance with the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, NEIL proceeds received allocable
to retail customers will be applied first to replacement power costs incurred
after December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2016, with the remainder used to
write down the remaining Crystal River Unit 3 investments.   

  Progress
Energy Florida believes the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, the
actions taken and costs incurred in response to the Crystal River Unit 3
delamination have been prudent and, accordingly, considers replacement power
and capital costs not recoverable through insurance to be recoverable through
its fuel cost-recovery clause or base rates. Additional replacement power costs
and exit cost to wind down the operations at the plant and decommission Crystal
River Unit 3 could be material. Retirement of the plant could impact funding
obligations associated with Progress Energy Florida s nuclear decommissioning
trust fund.  

  Progress Energy
Florida is a party to a master participation agreement and other related
agreements with the joint owners of Crystal River Unit 3 which convey certain
rights and obligations on Progress Energy Florida and the joint owners. In
December 2012, Progress Energy Florida reached an agreement with one group of
joint owners related to all Crystal River Unit 3 matters.   

  Progress Energy
Florida cannot predict the outcome of matters described above.  

   Customer
Rate Matters.    In
conjunction with the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement, Progress Energy Florida
will maintain base rates at the current levels through the last billing cycle
of December 2016, except as described as follows. The agreement provides for a
$150 million increase in revenue requirements effective with the first billing
cycle of January 2013, while maintaining the current return on equity range of
9.5 percent to 11.5 percent. Additionally, costs associated with Crystal River
Unit 3 investments will be removed from retail rate base effective with the
first billing cycle of January 2013. Progress Energy Florida will accrue, for
future rate-setting purposes, a carrying charge on the Crystal River Unit 3
investment until the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset is recovered in base
rates beginning with the first billing cycle of January 2017. If Progress
Energy Florida s retail base rate earnings fall below the return on equity
range, as reported on a FPSC-adjusted or pro-forma basis on a Progress Energy
Florida monthly earnings surveillance report, Progress Energy Florida may
petition the FPSC to amend its base rates during the term of the agreement.
Refer to the discussion above regarding recovery of Crystal River Unit 3
investments if the plant is retired.  

  Progress Energy
Florida will refund $288 million to retail customers through its fuel clause. Progress
Energy Florida will refund $129 million in each of 2013 and 2014, and an
additional $10 million annually to residential and small commercial customers
in 2014, 2015 and 2016. At December 31, 2011, a regulatory liability was
established for the $288 million to be refunded in future periods. In 2011, the
corresponding charge was recorded as a reduction of operating revenues in Progress
Energy Florida s and Progress Energy s Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Income. As discussed above, Progress Energy Florida also
recorded a Regulatory liability of $100 million in the third quarter of 2012
related to replacement power obligations.   

   Levy
Nuclear Station.    On
July 30, 2008, Progress Energy Florida filed its COL application with the NRC
for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at its proposed Levy Nuclear Station
(Levy), which the NRC docketed on October 6, 2008. Various parties filed a
joint petition to intervene in the Levy COL application. On October 31 and
November 1, 2012, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board held an evidentiary
hearing on portions of the intervention petitions. A decision is expected in
March 2013. In 2008, the FPSC granted Progress Energy Florida s petition for an
affirmative Determination of Need and related orders requesting cost recovery
under Florida s nuclear cost-recovery rule for Levy, together with the
associated facilities, including transmission lines and substation facilities.   

  On April
30, 2012, as part of its annual nuclear cost recovery filing, Progress Energy
Florida updated the Levy project schedule and cost. Due to lower-than-projected
customer demand, the lingering economic slowdown, uncertainty regarding
potential carbon regulation and current low natural gas prices, Progress Energy
Florida has shifted the in-service date for the first Levy unit to 2024, with
the second unit following 18 months later. The revised schedule is consistent
with the recovery approach included in the 2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement.
Although the scope and overnight cost for Levy, including land acquisition,
related transmission work and other required investments, remain essentially
unchanged, the shift in schedule will increase escalation and carrying costs
and raise the total estimated project cost to between $19 billion and $24
billion.  

  Along
with the FPSC s annual prudence reviews, Progress Energy Florida will continue
to evaluate the project on an ongoing basis based on certain criteria,
including, but not limited to, cost; potential carbon regulation; fossil fuel
prices; the benefits of fuel diversification; public, regulatory and political
support; adequate financial cost-recovery mechanisms; appropriate levels of joint
owner participation; customer rate impacts; project feasibility; DSM and EE
programs; and availability and terms of capital financing. Taking into account
these criteria, Levy is considered to be Progress Energy Florida s preferred
baseload generation option.  

  Under
the terms of the 2012 FSPC Settlement Agreement, Progress Energy Florida began
residential cost-recovery of its proposed Levy Nuclear Station effective in the
first billing cycle of January 2013 at the fixed rates contained in the
settlement and continuing for a five-year period, with true-up of any actual
costs not recovered during the 5-year period occurring in the final year.
Progress Energy Florida will not file for recovery of any new Levy costs that
were not addressed in the 2012 FSPC Settlement Agreement before March 1, 2017
and will not begin recovering those costs from customers before the first
billing cycle of January, 2018, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to
the agreement. This amount is intended to recover the estimated retail project
costs to date plus costs necessary to obtain the COL and any engineering,
procurement and construction cancellation costs, if Progress Energy Florida
ultimately chooses to cancel that contract. In

addition,
the consumer parties will not oppose Progress Energy Florida continuing to
pursue a COL for Levy. The 2012 FSPC Settlement Agreement also provides that
Progress Energy Florida will treat the allocated wholesale cost of Levy
(approximately $68 million) as a retail regulatory asset and include this asset
as a component of rate base and amortization expense for regulatory reporting.
Progress Energy Florida will have the discretion to accelerate and/or suspend
such amortization in full or in part provided that it amortizes all of the
regulatory asset by December 31, 2016.   

   Cost
of Removal Reserve.    The
2012 and 2010 FPSC Settlement Agreements (Settlement Agreements) provide Progress
Energy Florida the discretion to reduce cost of removal amortization expense by
up to the balance in the cost of removal reserve until the earlier of (a) its
applicable cost of removal reserve reaches zero, or (b) the expiration of the
2012 FPSC Settlement Agreement. Progress Energy Florida may not reduce
amortization expense if the reduction would cause it to exceed the appropriate
high point of the return on equity range, as established in the Settlement Agreements.
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreements, Progress Energy Florida recognized a
reduction in amortization expense of $178 million and $250 million for the years
ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Duke Energy recognized a
reduction in amortization expense of $120 million for the year ended December
31, 2012. Progress Energy Florida had eligible cost of removal reserves of $110
million remaining at December 31, 2012, which is impacted by accruals in
accordance with its latest depreciation study, removal costs expended and
reductions in amortization expense as permitted by the Settlement Agreements.  

   Anclote Units 1 and 2.
   On
March 29, 2012, Progress Energy Florida announced plans to convert the 1,010 MW
Anclote Units 1 and 2 (Anclote) from oil and natural gas fired to 100 percent
natural gas fired and requested that the FPSC permit recovery of the estimated
$79 million conversion cost through the Environmental Cost Recovery Clause
(ECRC). Progress Energy Florida believes this conversion is the most
cost-effective alternative for Anclote to achieve and maintain compliance with
applicable environmental regulations. On September 13, 2012, the FPSC approved Progress
Energy Florida s request to seek cost recovery through the ECRC. Progress
Energy Florida anticipates that both converted units will be placed in service
by the end of 2013.  

Duke
Energy Ohio   

   Capacity Rider Filing.
   On
August 29, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application with the PUCO for the
establishment of a charge, pursuant to Ohio s state compensation mechanism, for
capacity provided consistent with its obligations as a Fixed Resource
Requirement (FRR) entity. The application included a request for deferral
authority and for a new tariff to implement the charge. The deferral being
sought is the difference between its costs and market-based prices for
capacity. The requested tariff would implement a charge to be collected via a
rider through which such deferred balances will subsequently be recovered. 24
parties moved to intervene. Hearings have been set for April 2, 2013. Under the
current procedural schedule, Duke Energy Ohio expects an order in 2013.  

   2012 Electric Rate
Case.    On
July 9, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application with the PUCO for an
increase in electric distribution rates of approximately $87 million. On
average, total electric rates would increase approximately 5.1% under the
filing. The rate increase is designed to recover the cost of investments in
projects to improve reliability for customers and upgrades to the distribution
system. Pursuant to a stipulation in another case, Duke Energy Ohio will
continue recovering its costs associated with grid modernization in a separate
rider.  

  Duke Energy Ohio
expects revised rates, if approved, to go into effect in the first half of
2013.   

   2012 Natural Gas Rate
Case.    On
July 9, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application with the PUCO for an
increase in natural gas distribution rates of approximately $45 million. On
average, total natural gas rates would increase approximately 6.6% under the
filing. The rate increase is designed to recover the cost of upgrades to the
distribution system, as well as environmental cleanup of manufactured gas plant
sites. In addition to the recovery of costs associated with MGP sites, the rate
request includes a proposal for an accelerated service line replacement program
and a new rider to recover the associated incremental cost. The filing also
requests that the PUCO renew the rider recovery of Duke Energy Ohio s
accelerated main replacement program and grid modernization program.  

  On January 4, 2013,
the PUCO Staff filed a staff report recommending that Duke Energy Ohio only be
allowed to recover costs related to MGP sites which are currently used and
useful in the provision of natural gas distribution service. Duke Energy Ohio
filed its objection to the staff report on February 4, 2013.  

  Duke Energy Ohio
expects revised rates, if approved, to go into effect in the first half of
2013.   

   Generation Asset
Transfer.   
On April 2, 2012 and amended on June 22, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio and various
affiliated entities filed an Application for Authorization for Disposition of
Jurisdictional Facilities with FERC. The application seeks to transfer, from
Duke Energy Ohio s rate-regulated Ohio utility company, the legacy coal-fired
and combustion gas turbine assets to a nonregulated affiliate, consistent with
the ESP stipulation approved by the PUCO on November 22, 2011. The application
outlines a potential additional step in the reorganization that would result in
a transfer of all of Duke Energy Ohio s Commercial Power business to an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. The process of determining the
optimal corporate structure is an ongoing evaluation of factors, such as tax
considerations, that may change between now and the transfer date. In
conjunction with the transfer, Duke Energy Ohio s capital structure will be
restructured to reflect appropriate debt and equity ratios for its regulated
Franchised Electric and Gas operations. The transfer could instead be
accomplished within a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio
depending on final tax structuring analysis. The FERC approved the application on
September 5, 2012. Duke Energy Ohio has agreed to transfer the legacy
coal-fired and combustion gas turbine assets on or before December 31, 2014.  

   Standard Service Offer
(SSO).    The
PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohio s current Electric Security Plan (ESP) on
November 22, 2011. The ESP effectively separates the generation of electricity
from Duke Energy Ohio s retail load obligation and requires Duke Energy Ohio to
transfer its generation assets to a nonregulated affiliate on or before
December 31, 2014. The ESP includes competitive auctions for electricity supply
whereby the energy price is recovered from retail customers. As a result, Duke
Energy Ohio now earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of
electricity only and not on the cost of the underlying energy. New rates for
Duke Energy Ohio went into effect for SSO customers on January 1, 2012. The ESP
also includes a provision for a non-bypassable stability charge of $110 million
per year to be collected from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014.

On
January 18, 2012, the PUCO denied a request for rehearing of its decision on
Duke Energy Ohio s ESP filed by Columbus Southern Power and Ohio Power Company.

Regional Transmission
Organization Realignment.    Duke Energy Ohio, which includes its wholly owned
subsidiary Duke Energy Kentucky, transferred control of its transmission assets
to effect a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) realignment from MISO to
PJM, effective December 31, 2011.   

  On December 16, 2010,
the FERC issued an order related to MISO s cost allocation methodology
surrounding Multi-Value Projects (MVP), a type of MISO Transmission Expansion
Planning (MTEP) project cost. MISO expects that MVP will fund the costs of
large transmission projects designed to bring renewable generation from the
upper Midwest to load centers in the eastern portion of the MISO footprint.
MISO approved MVP proposals with estimated project costs of approximately $5.2
billion prior to the date of Duke Energy Ohio s exit from MISO on December 31,
2011. These projects are expected to be undertaken by the constructing
transmission owners from 2012 through 2020 with costs recovered through MISO
over the useful life of the projects. The FERC order did not clearly and
expressly approve MISO s apparent interpretation that a withdrawing
transmission owner is obligated to pay its share of costs of all MVP projects
approved by MISO up to the date of the withdrawing transmission owners  exit
from MISO. Duke Energy Ohio has historically represented approximately five-percent
of the MISO system. Duke Energy Ohio, among other parties, sought rehearing of
the FERC MVP order. On October 21, 2011, the FERC issued an order on rehearing
in this matter largely affirming its original MVP order and conditionally
accepting MISO s compliance filing as well as determining that the MVP
allocation methodology is consistent with cost causation principles and FERC
precedent. The FERC also reiterated that it would not prejudge any settlement
agreement between an RTO and a withdrawing transmission owner for fees that a
withdrawing transmission owner owes to the RTO. The order further states that
any such fees that a withdrawing transmission owner owes to an RTO are a matter
for those parties to negotiate, subject to review by the FERC. The FERC also
ruled that Duke Energy Ohio s challenge of MISO s ability to allocate MVP costs
to a withdrawing transmission owner is beyond the scope of the proceeding. The
order further stated that MISO s tariff withdrawal language establishes that
once cost responsibility for transmission upgrades is determined, withdrawing
transmission owners retain any costs incurred prior to the withdrawal date. In
order to preserve its rights, Duke Energy Ohio filed an appeal of the FERC
order in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The case was consolidated with
appeals of the FERC order by other parties in the Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals.   

  On October 14, 2011,
Duke Energy Ohio filed an application with the FERC to establish new wholesale
customer rates for transmission service under PJM s Open Access Transmission
Tariff. In this filing, Duke Energy Ohio sought recovery of its legacy MTEP
costs, including MVP costs, and submitted an analysis showing that the benefits
of the RTO realignment outweigh the costs to the customers. The new rates went
into effect, subject to refund, on January 1, 2012. Protests were filed by
certain transmission customers. On April 24, 2012, FERC issued an order in
which it, denied recovery of legacy MTEP costs without prejudice to the right
of Duke Energy Ohio to make another filing including a more comprehensive
cost-benefit analysis to support such recovery and set the return on equity
component of the rate for hearing. Duke Energy Ohio has entered into a
settlement agreement with the only remaining protester, American Municipal
Power, Inc. (AMP) under which the return on equity will be set at 11.38% legacy
MTEP costs will be recovered in rates, and AMP will receive a credit equal to
75% of its share of the legacy MTEP costs.  The settlement agreement was filed
with the FERC on February 4, 2012 and requires FERC approval.  

  On December 29, 2011,
MISO filed with FERC a Schedule 39 to MISO s tariff. Schedule 39 provides for
the allocation of MVP costs to a withdrawing owner based on the owner s actual
transmission load after the owner s withdrawal from MISO, or, if the owner
fails to report such load, based on the owner s historical usage in MISO
assuming annual load growth. On January 19, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio filed with
FERC a protest of the allocation of MVP costs to them under Schedule 39. On
February 27, 2012, the FERC accepted Schedule 39 as a just and reasonable basis
for MISO to charge for MVP costs, a transmission owner that withdraws from MISO
after January 1, 2012. The FERC set for hearing whether MISO s proposal to use
the methodology in Schedule 39 to calculate the obligation of transmission
owners who withdrew from MISO prior to January 1, 2012 (such as Duke Energy
Ohio) to pay for MVP costs is consistent with the MVP-related withdrawal
obligations in the tariff at the time that they withdrew from MISO, and, if
not, what amount of, and methodology for calculating, any MVP cost
responsibility should be.   

  On March 28, 2012,
Duke Energy Ohio filed a request for rehearing of FERC s February 27, 2012
order on MISO s Schedule 39. On December 19, 2012, the FERC Trial Staff
submitted testimony in the Schedule 39 hearing proceeding in which its witness
stated his opinion that Duke Energy Ohio should not be liable for any MVP
costs. The role of the FERC Trial Staff is to act as an independent party in
the proceeding; it has no judicial authority. The hearing has been scheduled
for April 2013.     

  On December 31, 2011,
Duke Energy Ohio recorded a liability for its MISO exit obligation and share of
MTEP costs, excluding MVP, of approximately $110 million. This liability was
recorded within Other in Current liabilities and Other in Deferred credits and
other liabilities on Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Balance Sheets upon exit
from MISO on December 31, 2011. Approximately $74 million of this amount was
recorded as a regulatory asset while $36 million was recorded to Operation,
maintenance and other in Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income. In addition to the above amounts, Duke
Energy Ohio may also be responsible for costs associated with MISO MVP
projects. Duke Energy Ohio is contesting its obligation to pay for such costs.
However, depending on the final outcome of this matter, Duke Energy Ohio could
incur material costs associated with MVP projects, which are not reasonably
estimable at this time. Regulatory accounting treatment will be pursued for any
costs incurred in connection with the resolution of this matter.   

  The following table
provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of Duke Energy
Ohio s recorded obligations related to its withdrawal from MISO.

Edwardsport
IGCC Plant.    On
November 20, 2007, the IURC issued an order granting Duke Energy Indiana a CPCN
for the construction of a 618 MW IGCC power plant at Duke Energy Indiana s Edwardsport
Generating Station in Knox County, Indiana with a cost estimate of $1.985
billion and timely recovery of costs related to the project. On January 25,
2008, Duke Energy Indiana received the final air permit from the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management. The Citizens Action Coalition of
Indiana, Inc. (CAC), Sierra Club, Inc., Save the Valley, Inc., and Valley
Watch, Inc., all intervenors in the CPCN proceeding, have appealed the air
permit.   

  On May 1, 2008, Duke
Energy Indiana filed its first semi-annual IGCC rider and ongoing review
proceeding with the IURC as required under the CPCN order issued by the IURC.
In its filing, Duke Energy Indiana requested approval of a new cost estimate
for the IGCC project of $2.35 billion (including $125 million of AFUDC) and for
approval of plans to study carbon capture as required by the IURC s CPCN order.
On January 7, 2009, the IURC approved Duke Energy Indiana s request, including
the new cost estimate of $2.35 billion, and cost recovery associated with a
study on carbon capture. On November 3, 2008 and May 1, 2009, Duke Energy
Indiana filed its second and third semi-annual IGCC riders, respectively, both
of which were approved by the IURC in full.   

  On November 24, 2009,
Duke Energy Indiana filed a petition for its fourth semi-annual IGCC rider and
ongoing review proceeding with the IURC. As Duke Energy Indiana experienced
design modifications, quantity increases and scope growth above what was
anticipated from the preliminary engineering design, capital costs to the IGCC
project were anticipated to increase. Duke Energy Indiana forecasted that the
additional capital cost items would use the remaining contingency and
escalation amounts in the current $2.35 billion cost estimate and add $150
million, excluding the impact associated with the need to add more contingency.
Duke Energy Indiana did not request approval of an increased cost estimate in
the fourth semi-annual update proceeding; rather, Duke Energy Indiana
requested, and the IURC approved, a subdocket proceeding in which Duke Energy
Indiana would present additional evidence regarding an updated estimated cost
for the IGCC project and in which a more comprehensive review of the IGCC
project could occur. The evidentiary hearing for the fourth semi-annual update
proceeding was held April 6, 2010, and an interim order was received on
July 28, 2010. The order approved the implementation of an updated IGCC rider
to recover costs incurred through September 30, 2009. The approvals were on an
interim basis pending the outcome of the sub-docket proceeding involving the
revised cost estimate as discussed further below.   

  On April 16, 2010,
Duke Energy Indiana filed a revised cost estimate for the IGCC project
reflecting an estimated cost increase of $530 million. Duke Energy Indiana
requested approval of the revised cost estimate of $2.88 billion (including
$160 million of AFUDC), and for continuation of the existing cost recovery
treatment. A major driver of the cost increase included quantity increases and
design changes, which impacted the scope, productivity and schedule of the IGCC
project. On September 17, 2010, an agreement was reached with the Indiana
Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC), Duke Energy Indiana Industrial
Group and Nucor Steel Indiana to increase the authorized cost estimate of $2.35
billion to $2.76 billion, and to cap the project s costs that could be passed
on to customers at $2.975 billion. Any construction cost amounts above $2.76
billion would be subject to a prudence review similar to most other rate base
investments in Duke Energy Indiana s next general rate increase request before
the IURC. Duke Energy Indiana agreed to accept a 150 basis point reduction in
the equity return for any project construction costs greater than $2.35
billion. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana agreed not to file for a general
rate case increase before March 2012. Duke Energy Indiana also agreed to reduce
depreciation rates earlier than would otherwise be required and to forego a
deferred tax incentive related to the IGCC project. As a result of the
settlement, Duke Energy Indiana recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of
approximately $44 million in the third quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of
the reduction in the return on equity. The charge is recorded in Impairment
charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The
IURC convened a technical conference on November 3, 2010, related to the
continuing need for the Edwardsport IGCC facility. On December 9, 2010, the parties
to the settlement withdrew the settlement agreement to provide an opportunity
to assess whether and to what extent the settlement agreement remained a
reasonable allocation of risks and rewards and whether modifications to the
settlement agreement were appropriate. Management determined that the
approximate $44 million charge discussed above was not impacted by the
withdrawal of the settlement agreement.  

  During 2010, Duke
Energy Indiana filed petitions for its fifth and sixth semi-annual IGCC riders.
Evidentiary hearings were held on April 24, 2012 and April 25, 2012.  

  The CAC, Sierra Club,
Inc., Save the Valley, Inc., and Valley Watch, Inc. filed motions for two
subdocket proceedings alleging improper communications, undue influence, fraud,
concealment and gross mismanagement, and a request for field hearing in this
proceeding. Duke Energy Indiana opposed the requests. On February 25, 2011, the
IURC issued an order which denied the request for a subdocket to investigate
the allegations of improper communications and undue influence at this time,
finding there were other agencies better suited for such investigation. The
IURC also found that allegations of fraud, concealment and gross mismanagement
related to the IGCC project should be heard in a Phase II proceeding of the
cost estimate subdocket and set evidentiary hearings on both Phase I (cost
estimate increase) and Phase II beginning in August 2011. After procedural
delays, hearings began on Phase I on October 26, 2011 and on Phase II on
November 21, 2011.  

  On March 10, 2011,
Duke Energy Indiana filed testimony with the IURC proposing a framework
designed to mitigate customer rate impacts associated with the Edwardsport IGCC
project. Duke Energy Indiana s filing proposed a cap on the project s
construction costs, (excluding financing costs), which can be recovered through
rates at $2.72 billion. It also proposed rate-related adjustments that would
lower the overall customer rate increase related to the project from an average
of 19% to approximately 16%.  

  On June 27, 2011, Duke
Energy Indiana filed testimony with the IURC in connection with its seventh
semi-annual rider request which included an update on the current cost forecast
of the Edwardsport IGCC project. The updated forecast, excluding AFUDC, increased
from $2.72 billion to $2.82 billion, not including any contingency for
unexpected start-up events. On June 30, 2011, the OUCC and intervenors filed
testimony in Phase I recommending that Duke Energy Indiana be disallowed cost
recovery of any of the additional cost estimate increase above the previously
approved cost estimate of $2.35 billion. Duke Energy Indiana filed rebuttal
testimony on August 3, 2011.   

  In the subdocket
proceeding, on July 14, 2011, the OUCC and certain intervenors filed testimony
in Phase II alleging that Duke Energy Indiana concealed information and grossly
mismanaged the project, and therefore Duke Energy Indiana should only be
permitted to recover from customers $1.985 billion, the original IGCC project
cost estimate approved by the IURC. Other intervenors recommended that Duke
Energy Indiana not be able to rely on any cost recovery granted under the CPCN
or the first cost increase order. Duke Energy Indiana believes it has
diligently and prudently managed the project. On September 9, 2011, Duke Energy
defended against the allegations in its responsive testimony. The OUCC and
intervenors filed their final rebuttal testimony in Phase II on or before
October 7, 2011, making similar claims of fraud, concealment and gross
mismanagement and recommending the same outcome of limiting Duke Energy
Indiana s recovery to

the $1.985 billion initial cost
estimate. Additionally, the CAC recommended that recovery be limited to the
costs incurred on the IGCC project as of November 30, 2009, with further IURC
proceedings to be held to determine the financial consequences of this
recommendation. As of November 30, 2009, Duke Energy Indiana estimated it had
committed costs of $1.6 billion.  

  On October 19, 2011,
Duke Energy Indiana revised its project cost estimate from approximately $2.82
billion, excluding financing costs, to approximately $2.98 billion, excluding
financing costs. The revised estimate reflects additional cost pressures
resulting from quantity increases and the resulting impact on the scope,
productivity and schedule of the IGCC project. Duke Energy Indiana previously
proposed to the IURC a cost cap of approximately $2.72 billion, plus the actual
AFUDC that accrues on that amount. As a result, Duke Energy Indiana recorded a
pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $222 million in the third quarter of
2011 related to costs expected to be incurred above the cost cap. This charge
is in addition to the previous pre-tax impairment charge related to the
Edwardsport project discussed above and is recorded in Impairment charges on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   

  On November 30, 2011,
Duke Energy Indiana filed a petition with the IURC in connection with its
eighth semi-annual rider request for the Edwardsport IGCC project. Evidentiary
hearings for the seventh and eighth semi-annual rider requests were held on
August 6, 2012 and August 7, 2012.   

  Phase I and Phase II
hearings concluded on January 24, 2012. The CAC has filed repeated requests for
the IURC to consider issues of ethics, undue influence, due process violations
and appearance of impropriety. The IURC denied the most recent motion in March
2012. In April 2012, the CAC filed a motion requesting the IURC to certify
questions of law for appeal regarding allegations of fraud on the commission
and due process violations. This motion was denied.   

  On April 30, 2012,
Duke Energy Indiana entered into a settlement agreement with the OUCC, the Duke
Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel-Indiana on the cost increase
for construction of the Edwardsport IGCC plant, including both Phase I and
Phase II of the subdocket. Pursuant to the agreement, there would be a cap on
costs to be reflected in customer rates of $2.595 billion, including estimated
financing costs through June 30, 2012. Pursuant to the agreement, Duke Energy
Indiana would be able to recover additional financing costs until November 30,
2012, and 85% of financing costs that accrue thereafter. Duke Energy Indiana
also agreed not to request a retail electric base rate increase prior to March
2013, with rates in effect no earlier than April 1, 2014. As a result of the
agreement, Duke Energy Indiana recorded pre-tax impairment and other charges of
approximately $420 million in the first quarter of 2012. Approximately $400
million is recorded in Impairment charges and the remaining approximately $20
million is recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy s
Consolidated Statement of Operations and in Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The $20 million recorded in
Operation, maintenance and other, is attributed to legal fees Duke Energy
Indiana will be responsible for on behalf of certain intervenors, as well as
funding for low income energy assistance, as required by the settlement
agreement. These charges are in addition to previous pre-tax impairment charges
related to the Edwardsport IGCC project as discussed above.   

  The CAC, Sierra Club
Indiana chapter, Save the Valley and Valley Watch, filed testimony in
opposition to the April 30, 2012 settlement agreement contending the agreement
should not be approved, and that the amount of costs recovered from customers
should be less than what the settlement agreement provides, potentially even
zero. In addition to reiterating their prior concerns with the Edwardsport IGCC
project, the intervenors noted above also contend new settlement terms should
be added to mitigate carbon emissions, conditions should be added prior to the
plant being declared in-service and the IURC should consider their allegations
of undue influence. Duke Energy Indiana, the Industrial Group and the OUCC,
filed rebuttal testimony supporting the settlement as reasonable and in the
public interest. An evidentiary hearing on the settlement agreement concluded
on July 19, 2012. Post-hearing briefing has been completed.  

  On June 8, 2012, Duke
Energy Indiana filed a petition with the IURC in connection with its ninth
semi-annual rider request for the Edwardsport IGCC project. An evidentiary
hearing for the ninth semi-annual rider request was January 15, 2013.  

  On October 30, 2012,
Duke Energy Indiana revised its project cost estimate from approximately $2.98
billion, excluding financing costs, to approximately $3.154 billion, excluding
financing costs, and revised the projected in-service date from the first
quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2013. The revised estimate is due
primarily to lower than projected revenues from test output and delays due to
more extensive testing conditions. As a result, Duke Energy Indiana recorded a
pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $180 million in the third quarter of
2012 related to costs expected to be incurred above the cost cap proposed in
the settlement agreement filed in April 2012, as discussed above. This amount
is in addition to previous pre-tax impairment charges related to the
Edwardsport IGCC project and is recorded in Impairment charges on Duke Energy s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  

  On
December 27, 2012, the IURC approved the settlement agreement finalized in
April 2012, as discussed above, between Duke Energy Indiana, the OUCC, the Duke
Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel Indiana, on the cost increase
for the construction of the project. This order resolves all subdocket issues
in Phase I and Phase II of the proceeding. The settlement agreement, as
approved, caps costs to be reflected in customer rates at $2.595 billion,
including estimated AFUDC through June 30, 2012. Duke Energy Indiana was
allowed to recover AFUDC after June 30, 2012 until customer rates are revised,
with such recovery decreasing to 85% on AFUDC accrued after November 30, 2012.  

  The
IURC modified the settlement agreement as previously agreed to by the parties
to (i) require the Duke Energy Indiana to credit customers $31 million for cost
control incentive payments which the IURC found to be unwarranted as a result
of delays that arose from project cost overruns and (ii) provide that if the Duke
Energy Indiana should recover more than the project costs absorbed by Duke
Energy s shareholders through litigation, any surplus must be returned to the Duke
Energy Indiana s ratepayers. On December 11, 2012, Duke Energy Indiana filed an
arbitration action against General Electric Company (General Electric) and
Bechtel Corporation (Bechtel) in connection with their work at the Edwardsport
IGCC facility. Duke Energy Indiana is seeking damages of not less than $560
million.  Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter.   

  The
CAC, Sierra Club Indiana chapter, Save the Valley and Valley Watch have
appealed the IURC order approving the Settlement Agreement to the Indiana Court
of Appeals.  No briefing schedule has been set.

Also
on December 27, 2012, the IURC issued orders on the fifth, sixth, seventh and
eighth IGCC riders, concluding those proceedings. In the eighth IGCC rider
order, the IURC approved construction work in process recovery on the
settlement agreement s hard cost cap amount of $2.595 billion.  

  The project is
scheduled to be in commercial operation in mid-2013. Additional updates to the
cost estimate could occur through the completion of the plant.   

   Duke
Energy Indiana Storm Cost Deferrals.    On July 14, 2010, the IURC approved Duke
Energy Indiana s deferral of $12 million of retail jurisdictional storm expense
until the next retail rate proceeding. This amount represents a portion of
costs associated with a January 27, 2009 ice storm, which damaged Duke
Energy Indiana s distribution system. On August 12, 2010, the OUCC filed a
notice of appeal with the IURC. On December 7, 2010, the IURC issued an
order reopening this proceeding for review in consideration of the evidence
presented as a result of an internal audit performed as part of an IURC
investigation of Duke Energy Indiana s hiring of an attorney from the IURC
staff which resulted in the IURC s termination of the employment of the
Chairman of the IURC. The audit did not find that the order conflicted with the
staff report; however, it did note that the staff report offered no specific
recommendation to either approve or deny the requested relief, and that the
original order was appealed. On October 19, 2011, the IURC issued an order
denying Duke Energy Indiana the right to defer the storm expense discussed
above.   On December 29, 2012, the Indiana Court of
Appeals upheld the IURC s decision to deny recovery of the storm costs.  

   Phase 2 Environmental
Compliance Proceeding.    On June 28, 2012, Duke Energy Indiana filed with the IURC
a plan for the addition of certain environmental pollution control projects on
several of its coal-fired generating units in order to comply with existing and
proposed environmental rules and regulations. The plan calls for a combination
of selective catalytic reduction systems, dry sorbent injection systems for SO 3 
mitigation, activated carbon injection systems and/or mercury re-emission
chemical injection systems. The capital costs are estimated at $395 million
(excluding AFUDC). Duke Energy Indiana also indicated that it preliminarily
anticipates the retirement of Wabash River Units 2 through 5 in 2015 and is
still evaluating future equipment additions or retirement of Wabash River Unit
6. An evidentiary hearing was held January 7, 2013 through January 9, 2013,
with an order expected in the second quarter of 2013.  

Other
Regulatory Matters   

Progress Energy Merger
NCUC Investigation.    On
July 6, 2012, the NCUC issued an order initiating investigation and scheduling
hearings addressing the timing of the Duke Energy board of directors  decision
on July 2, 2012, to replace William D. Johnson with James E. Rogers as
President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Duke Energy, as well as other
related matters.   

  Pursuant to the merger
agreement, William D. Johnson, Chairman, President and CEO of Progress Energy
became President and CEO of Duke Energy and James E. Rogers, Chairman,
President and CEO of Duke Energy became Executive Chairman of Duke Energy upon
close of the merger. Mr. Johnson subsequently resigned as the President and CEO
of Duke Energy, effective July 3, 2012 and Mr. Rogers was appointed to be CEO.  

  On
November 29, 2012, Duke Energy reached a settlement agreement with the NCUC and
the North Carolina Public Staff regarding the investigations discussed above.
Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Duke Energy agreed to a number of terms,
the most notable of which are (i) Duke Energy will maintain at least 1,000
employees in Raleigh, North Carolina for at least five years from date of the settlement
agreement; (ii) Duke Energy will guarantee an additional $25 million in fuel
and fuel-related cost savings for Duke Energy s North Carolina retail
customers; (iii) Duke Energy will contribute an additional $5 million to
workforce development and low-income assistance in North Carolina; (iv) Duke
Energy Carolinas will defer filing a general rate case in North Carolina until
February 2013; and (v) Duke Energy will make various changes in management and
Board members, which includes CEO James E. Rogers retirement no later than
December 31, 2013. On December 3, 2012, the NCUC approved the settlement
agreement between Duke Energy, the NCUC and the North Carolina Public Staff.
The settlement agreement resolves all matters related to the NCUC investigation.  

  Duke Energy has also
been contacted by the SEC to explain the circumstances surrounding the NCUC
Investigation and shareholder lawsuits in connection with the closing of the
merger with Progress Energy. See Note 5 for a discussion of shareholder litigation.
A meeting was held with the SEC staff in late October. Duke Energy intends to
continue to assist the SEC staff, as they request.  

   Progress Energy Merger
North Carolina Department of Justice (NCDOJ) Investigations.    Duke Energy also
received an Investigative Demand issued by the NCDOJ on July 6, 2012,
requesting the production of certain documents related to the issues which were
also the subject of the NCUC Investigation discussed above. Duke Energy s
responses to these requests were submitted on August 7, 2012. On August 1,
2012, the NCUC engaged the law firm of Jenner   Block to conduct an
investigation of these matters. On December 3, 2012, Duke Energy reached a
settlement agreement with the NCDOJ.   

   Joint Dispatch
Agreement (JDA).   
On June 29, 2012, and July 2, 2012, the NCUC and the PSCSC, respectively,
approved the JDA between Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas.
The JDA provides for joint dispatch of the generating facilities of both Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas for the purpose of reducing the
cost of serving the native loads of both companies. As set forth in the JDA,
Duke Energy Carolinas will act as the joint dispatcher, on behalf of both Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas. As joint dispatcher, Duke
Energy Carolinas will direct the dispatch of both Duke Energy Carolinas  and Progress
Energy Carolinas  power supply resources, determine payments between the
parties for the purchase and sale of energy between Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress
Energy Carolinas, and calculate and allocate the fuel cost savings to the
parties. The JDA is subject to review by the PSCSC after one year. Refer to
Note 14 for further discussion.  

   Planned and Potential
Coal Plant Retirements.    The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated
Resource Plans (IRP) with their state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide
a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (15-20 years), and options
being considered to meet those needs. The IRP s filed by the Subsidiary Registrants
in 2012 and 2011 included planning assumptions to potentially retire by 2015,
certain coal-fired generating facilities in North Carolina, South Carolina,
Indiana and Ohio that do not have the requisite emission control equipment,
primarily to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that are
not yet effective. Additionally, management is considering the impact pending
environmental regulations might have on certain coal-fired generating
facilities in Florida.

Duke Energy continues to
  evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities

estimated useful lives,
  and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise
  recovered when any of these assets are retired. However, such recovery,
  including recovery of carrying costs on remaining book values, could be
  subject to future regulatory approvals and therefore cannot be assured.   

5. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES   

General Insurance    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants have insurance and reinsurance coverage either directly or
through indemnification from Duke Energy s captive insurance company, Bison,
and its affiliates, consistent with companies engaged in similar commercial
operations with similar type properties. The Duke Energy Registrants  coverage
includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for liabilities arising to
third parties for bodily injury and property damage resulting from the Duke
Energy Registrants  operations; (ii) workers  compensation liability coverage
to statutory limits; (iii) automobile liability coverage for all owned,
non-owned and hired vehicles covering liabilities to third parties for bodily injury
and property damage; (iv) insurance policies in support of the indemnification
provisions of the Duke Energy Registrants  by-laws and (v) property coverage
for all real and personal property damage, excluding electric transmission and
distribution lines, including damages arising from boiler and machinery
breakdowns, earthquake, flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or
replacement power coverage. All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or
retentions, sublimits, terms and conditions common for companies with similar
types of operations.  

  The Duke
Energy Registrants self-insure their transmission and distribution lines
against loss due to storm damage and other natural disasters. As discussed
further in Note 4, Progress Energy Florida maintains a storm damage reserve and
has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of named storms on an expedited
basis.  

  The cost
of the Duke Energy Registrants  coverage can fluctuate year to year reflecting any
changing claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance markets.  

  In the event of a
loss, the terms and amount of insurance and reinsurance available might not be
adequate to cover claims and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and
other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a
material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations, cash
flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses
may exceed limits of the coverage available.  

   Nuclear Insurance    

  Nuclear
insurance includes nuclear liability coverage; property, decontamination and
premature decommissioning coverage; and replacement power expense coverage.  

  Duke
Energy Carolinas owns and operates the McGuire Nuclear Station (McGuire) and the
Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee) and operates and has a partial ownership
interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station (Catawba). McGuire and Catawba each have
two nuclear reactors and Oconee has three. The other joint owners of Catawba
reimburse Duke Energy Carolinas for certain expenses associated with nuclear
insurance per the Catawba joint owner agreements.  

  Progress
Energy Carolinas owns and operates the Robinson Nuclear Station (Robinson) and
operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Brunswick Nuclear Station
(Brunswick) and Harris. Robinson and Harris each have one nuclear reactor and
Brunswick has two.

The other joint owners of
Brunswick and Harris reimburse Progress Energy Carolinas for certain expenses
associated with nuclear insurance per the Brunswick and Harris joint owner
agreements.  

  Progress
Energy Florida has a partial ownership interest in Crystal River Unit 3. The
other joint owners of Crystal River Unit 3 reimburse Progress Energy Florida
for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Crystal River
Unit 3 joint owner participation agreement. Due to the planned retirement of Crystal
River Unit 3, Progress Energy Florida and the other joint owners will evaluate
appropriate nuclear insurance adjustments.  

   Nuclear Liability Coverage   

  The
Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for public nuclear
liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total financial
protection liability. The maximum total financial protection liability, which
is currently $  12.6  
billion, is subject to an inflationary provision adjustment every five years.
Total nuclear liability coverage consists of a combination of private primary
nuclear liability insurance coverage and a mandatory industry risk-sharing
program to provide for excess nuclear liability coverage above the maximum
reasonably available private primary coverage. There is a possibility that
Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay
claims.  

   Primary Nuclear
Liability Insurance.   
Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida
have purchased the maximum reasonably available private primary nuclear
liability insurance as required by law, which currently is $  375   million per station.  

   Excess Nuclear
Liability Program.    This
program provides $  12.2  
billion of coverage per incident through the Price-Anderson Act s mandatory
industry-wide excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling.
The $12.2 billion is the sum of the current potential cumulative retrospective
premium assessments of $117.5 million per licensed commercial nuclear reactor.
There are currently 104 licensed commercial nuclear reactors in the industry.
This would be increased by $117.5 million for each additional commercial
nuclear reactor licensed, or reduced by $117.5 million for nuclear reactors no
longer operational and which may be exempted from the risk pooling program.
Under this program, licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to
compensate for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear
incident at any licensed facility in the U.S. If such an incident should occur
and public nuclear liability damages exceed primary nuclear liability
insurance, licensees may be assessed up to $117.5 million for each of their
licensed reactors, payable at a rate not to exceed $17.5 million a year per
licensed reactor for each incident. The assessment and rate are subject to
indexing for inflation and may be subject to state premium taxes. The
Price-Anderson Act provides for an inflation adjustment at least every five
years with the last adjustment effective October 2008.  

   Nuclear Property Coverage   

  Duke Energy Carolinas,
Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida are members of NEIL,
which provides property and accidental outage insurance coverage for nuclear
facilities under three policy programs: the primary property insurance program,
the excess property insurance program and the accidental outage insurance
program.  

  Pursuant to
regulations of the NRC, each company s property damage insurance policies
provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied, first, to place the
plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident, and second,
to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning,
plant repair or restoration.  

  Losses resulting from
non-certified acts of terrorism are covered as common occurrences, such that if
non-certified terrorist acts occur against one or more commercial nuclear power
plants insured by NEIL within a 12 month period, they would be treated as one
event and the owners of the plants where the act occurred would share one full
limit of liability. The full limit of liability is currently $  3.2   billion. Effective
April 1, 2013, NEIL will sublimit the total aggregate for all of their policies
for non-nuclear terrorist events to approximately $    1.83     billion.  

  In the event of a
loss, the terms and amount of insurance available might not be adequate to
cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other
expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material
effect on Duke Energy Carolinas , Progress Energy Carolinas  and Progress
Energy Florida s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each
company is responsible to the extent losses may exceed limits of the coverage available.

Primary Property Insurance.    This policy provides
$500 million of primary property damage coverage, with a $2.5 million
deductible per occurrence obligation, for Duke Energy Carolinas  nuclear
facilities and with a $10 million deductible per occurrence obligation for each
Progress Energy Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s nuclear facilities.   

   Excess Property
Insurance.   
For Duke Energy Carolinas, this policy provides excess property,
decontamination and decommissioning liability insurance of $2.25 billion for
Catawba and $1 billion each for Oconee and McGuire. Oconee and McGuire also
share an additional $1 billion insurance limit above their dedicated $1 billion
underlying excess. This shared additional excess $1 billion limit is not
subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss.  

  For Progress Energy
Carolinas, this policy provides excess property, decontamination and decommissioning
liability insurance with limits of $  750   million on Brunswick, Harris and Robinson. For
Progress Energy Florida, this policy provides excess property, decontamination
and decommissioning liability insurance with limits of $  750   million on Crystal River Unit 3. Progress Energy
Carolinas  nuclear stations and Progress Energy Florida s nuclear station also
share an additional $  1  
billion insurance limit above their dedicated $750 million underlying excess.
This shared additional excess $1 billion limit is not subject to reinstatement
in the event of a loss.  

  Effective April 1,
2013, NEIL will sublimit property damage losses to $  1.5   billion for non-nuclear accidental property
damage.  

   Accidental
Outage Insurance.   
This policy     provides replacement
power ex  p  ense coverage   r  esulting from an     accidental prope  rt  y
damage out  a  ge      of a nuclear unit.  

  Duke
Energy Carolinas  McGuire and Catawba units are each insured for up to $3.5
million per week, and the Oconee units are insured for up to $2.8 million per
week. Coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is
out of service due to a common accident. Initial coverage begins after a
12-week deductible period for Catawba and a 26-week deductible period for
McGuire and Oconee and

decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to
a common accident.  

  Progress
Energy Florida s Crystal River Unit 3 is insured for up to $4.5 million per
week. Initial coverage begins after a 12-week deductible period and continues
at 100 percent of the weekly limits for 52 weeks and at 80 percent of the
weekly limits for the next 71 weeks. The per accidental outage policy limit is
$  490   million.  

  Effective
April 1, 2013, NEIL will sublimit the accidental outage recovery to
approximately $  328  
million for non-nuclear accidental property damage.  

   Potential
Retroactive Premium Assessments.    In the event of NEIL losses, NEIL s board of
directors may assess member companies retroactive premiums of amounts up to 10
times their annual premiums. The current potential maximum assessments for Duke
Energy Carolinas are primary property insurance for $45 million, excess
property insurance for $42 million and accidental outage insurance for $22
million. The current potential maximum assessments for Progress Energy
Carolinas are primary property insurance for $27 million, excess property insurance
for $  32   million and accidental
outage insurance for $19 million. The current potential maximum assessments for
Progress Energy Florida are primary property insurance for $  11   million, excess property insurance for $10
million and accidental outage insurance for $6 million.  

  The
maximum assessment amounts include   100   percent of Duke Energy Carolinas , Progress
Energy Carolinas , and Progress Energy Florida s potential obligations to NEIL
for their share of jointly owned reactors. However, the other joint owners of
the jointly owned reactors are obligated to assume their pro rata share of
liability for retrospective premiums and other premium assessments resulting
from the Price-Anderson Act s excess secondary financial protection program of
risk pooling, or from the NEIL policies.  

Environmental   

Duke
Energy is subject to international, federal, state and local regulations
regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other
environmental matters. The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to federal, state
and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid
waste disposal and other environmental matters. These regulations can be
changed from time to time, imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy
Registrants.  

  The
following environmental matters impact all of the Duke Energy Registrants.  

   Remediation
Activities   .
The Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at
various contaminated sites. These include some properties that are part of
ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. In
some cases, the Duke Energy Registrants no longer own the property. These sites
are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring. Managed in
conjunction with relevant federal, state and local agencies, activities vary
with site conditions and locations, remediation requirements, complexity and
sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve joint and several
liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution
actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held responsible for
contamination caused by other parties. In some instances, the Duke Energy
Registrants may share liability associated with contamination with other
potentially responsible parties, and may also benefit from insurance policies
or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. All of these
sites generally are managed as part of business or affiliate operations. The Duke
Energy Registrants continually assess the nature and extent of known or
potential environmentally related contingencies and record liabilities when
losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. The Duke Energy
Registrants have accrued costs associated with remediation activities at some
of their current and former sites for the stages of investigation, remediation
and monitoring that can be reasonably estimated, as well as other relevant
environmental contingent liabilities. At this time, the Duke Energy Registrants
cannot estimate the total costs that may be incurred in connection with the
remediation of all stages of all sites because the extent of environmental
impact, allocation among potentially responsible parties, remediation
alternatives, and/or regulatory decisions have not yet been determined. It is
anticipated that additional costs, which could be material, associated with
remediation activities at certain sites will be incurred in the future. Costs
associated with remediation activities within the Duke Energy Registrants 
operations are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other unless
regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable.  

  The
following table contains information regarding reserves for probable and
estimable costs related to the Duke Energy Registrants  various environmental
sites. These amounts are recorded in Other within Deferred Credits and Other
Liabilities on the Duke Energy Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Duke Energy Registrants 
accruals relate to certain former manufactured gas plants (MGP) and other sites
that have required, or are anticipated to require, investigation and/or
remediation. The Duke Energy Registrants could incur additional losses in
excess of their recorded reserves for the stages of investigation, remediation
and monitoring for their environmental sites that can be reasonably estimated
at this time. The maximum amount of the range for all stages of the Duke Energy
Registrants  environmental sites cannot be determined at this time. Actual
experience may differ from current estimates, and it is probable that estimates
will continue to change in the future.  

  In 2012,
Progress Energy Carolinas received approval from the North Carolina Department
of Environment and Natural Resources of the remedial action plan for its
remaining MGP site. Progress Energy Carolinas has accrued the estimated cost
for this remedial action plan.   

  At December
31, 2012, Progress Energy Florida s accrual primarily relates to an MGP site
located in Orlando, Florida. In 2012, the potentially responsible parties
received estimates for a range of viable remedial approaches for the first
phase of the Orlando MGP site. Progress Energy Florida has accrued its best
estimate of its obligation for the first phase of the Orlando MGP site based on
current estimates for the remedial approach considered to have more merit and
its current allocation share. The viable remedial approaches and related costs
for the second phase at the Orlando MGP site have not been determined.  

  Duke
Energy Ohio has received an order from the PUCO to defer the costs incurred for
probable and estimable costs related to environmental sites. Recovery of those
costs is being sought in Duke Energy Ohio s natural gas distribution rate case
as discussed in Note 4.  

  The additional
losses in excess of their recorded reserves that the Duke Energy Registrants 
could incur for the stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring for
their environmental sites that can be reasonably estimated at this time are
presented in the table below.

Clean
Water Act 316(b).    The
EPA published its proposed cooling water intake structures rule on
April 20, 2011. The proposed rule advances one main approach and three
alternatives. The main approach establishes aquatic protection requirements for
existing facilities that withdraw 2 million gallons or more of water per
day from rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, oceans, or other U.S.
waters for cooling purposes. Based on the main approach proposed, most, if not
all of the coal, natural gas and nuclear-fueled steam electric generating
facilities in which the Duke Energy Registrants are either a whole or partial
owner are likely affected sources unless retired prior to implementation of the
316(b) requirements.   

  The EPA plans
to finalize the 316(b) rule by June 2013. Compliance with portions of the rule
could begin as early as 2016. Because of the wide range of potential outcomes,
including the other three alternative proposals, the Duke Energy Registrants
are unable to predict the outcome of the rulemaking or estimate their costs to
comply at this time.   

   Cross-State
Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR).    On August 8, 2011, the final Cross-State Air
Pollution Rule (CSAPR) was published in the Federal Register. The CSAPR
established state-level annual SO 2  budgets and annual seasonal NO x 
budgets that were to take effect on January 1, 2012.  

  Numerous
parties challenged the rule. On August 21, 2012, by a 2-1 decision, the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the CSAPR. The court
also directed the EPA to continue administering the Clean Air Interstate Rule
(CAIR) that the Duke Energy Registrants have been complying with since 2009,
pending completion of a remand rulemaking to replace CSAPR with a valid rule.
The CAIR requires additional reductions in SO 2  and NO x 
emissions beginning in 2015. The EPA petitioned for rehearing by the Court of
Appeals, which was denied. The EPA might seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The CAIR will remain in force for an unknown period of time until the EPA
develops a replacement rule.

The Duke Energy Registrants
cannot predict the outcome of any further appeal or how a potential CSAPR
replacement rule could affect future emission reduction requirements. The
continued implementation of the CAIR pending the outcome of the rehearing
process and a potential CSAPR replacement rulemaking will not result in the
Duke Energy Registrants adding new emission controls.   

   Coal
Combustion Residuals (CCR).    On June 21, 2010, the EPA issued a proposal to regulate,
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, coal combustion residuals
(CCR), a term the EPA uses to describe the coal combustion byproducts
associated with the generation of electricity. The EPA proposal contains two
regulatory options whereby CCRs not employed in approved beneficial use
applications either would be regulated as hazardous waste or would continue to
be regulated as non-hazardous waste. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict
the outcome of this rulemaking. The EPA has stated that it may be 2014 before
it finalizes the regulation.  

   Mercury
and Air Toxics Standards (MATS).    The final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards
rule, previously referred to as the Utility MACT Rule, was published in the
Federal Register on February 16, 2012. The final rule establishes emission
limits for hazardous air pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and
oil-fired steam electric generating units. The rule requires sources to comply
with the emission limits by April 16, 2015. Under the CAA, permitting
authorities have the discretion to grant up to a 1-year compliance extension,
on a case-by-case basis, to sources that are unable to complete the
installation of emission controls before the compliance deadline. The Duke
Energy Registrants continue to develop and implement strategies for complying
with the rule s requirements. Strategies to achieve compliance with the final
MATS rules could include installing new or upgrading existing air emission
control equipment, developing monitoring processes, fuel switching and
accelerating retirement of some coal-fired electric-generating units. For additional
information, refer to Note 4 regarding potential plant retirements.   

  Numerous
petitions for review of the final MATS rule have been filed with the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The court established a schedule
for the litigation that has final briefs being filed on April 8, 2013. Oral
arguments have not been scheduled. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict
the outcome of the litigation or how it might affect the MATS requirements as
they apply to the Duke Energy Registrants. As disclosed in the following table,
the cost to the Duke Energy Registrants to comply with the proposed MATS
regulations will be material.   

   EPA
Greenhouse Gas New Source Performance Standards (NSPS).    On April 13,
2012, the EPA published in the Federal Register its proposed rule to establish
carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions standards for pulverized coal, IGCC,
and natural gas combined cycle electric generating units that are permitted and
constructed in the future. The proposal would not apply to any of the Duke
Energy Registrants  coal, including IGCC, and natural gas electric generation
plants that are currently under construction or in operation. Any future
pulverized coal and IGCC units will have to employ carbon capture and storage
(CCS) technology to meet the CO 2  emission standard the EPA has
proposed. The proposed standard will not require new natural gas combined cycle
facilities to install CCS technology.   

  Management
does not expect any material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  future
results of operations or cash flows based on the EPA s proposal. The final
rule, however, could be significantly different from the proposal. It is not
known when the EPA might finalize the rule.  

   Estimated
Cost and Impacts of EPA Rulemakings.    While the ultimate compliance requirements
for the Duke Energy Registrants for MATS, Clean Water Act 316(b) and CCRs will
not be known until all the rules have been finalized, for planning purposes,
the Duke Energy Registrants currently estimate that the cost of new control
equipment that may need to be installed on existing power plants to comply with
EPA regulations could total $  5  
billion to $6 billion, excluding AFUDC, over the next 10 years. This range
includes estimated costs for new control equipment necessary to comply with the
MATS, which is the only rule that has been finalized, as shown in the table
below:  

The Duke
Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power,
operation and maintenance, and other expenses in conjunction with these EPA
regulations, and also expect to incur costs for replacement generation for
potential coal-fired power plant retirements. Until the final regulatory
requirements of the group of EPA regulations are known and can be fully
evaluated, the potential compliance costs associated with these EPA regulatory
actions are subject to considerable uncertainty. Therefore, the actual
compliance costs incurred may be materially different from these estimates based
on the timing and requirements of the final EPA regulations. The Duke Energy
Registrants intend to seek regulatory recovery of amounts incurred associated
with regulated operations in complying with these regulations. Refer to Note 4
for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory
filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.

  On
August 3, 2012, Duke Energy was served with a shareholder Derivative Complaint,
which has been transferred to the North Carolina Business Court (   Krieger v.
Johnson, et al.).    The lawsuit names as defendants, William D. Johnson, James
E. Rogers and the Legacy Duke Directors. Duke Energy is named as a nominal
defendant. The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty in granting
excessive compensation to Mr. Johnson. A hearing on the defendants  motion to
dismiss was held on January 22, 2013. A decision on the motion made by the
defendants remains pending.  

  Duke Energy has been
served with two shareholder Derivative Complaints, filed in federal district
court in Delaware. The plaintiffs in    Tansey v. Rogers, et al.,    served on
August 17, 2012, and    Pinchuck v. Rogers, et al.   , served on October 31,
2012, allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets,
as well as claims under Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the
Legacy Duke Directors. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. On December
18, 2012, the defendants filed a motion to stay the case.  

  Duke Energy was also
served in July 2012 with three purported securities class action
lawsuits. These three cases (Craig v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al.;
Nieman v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al.; and Sunner v. Duke Energy
Corporation, et al.), have been consolidated in the United States District
Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The plaintiff filed a
Corrected Consolidated Complaint on January 28, 2013, alleging federal
Securities Act and Exchange Act claims based on allegedly materially false and
misleading representations and omissions made in the Registration Statement
filed on July 7, 2011, and subsequently incorporated into other documents, all
in connection with the post merger change in CEO. The Corrected Consolidated
Complaint names as defendants the Legacy Duke Directors and certain officers of
the company. The claims are purportedly brought on behalf of a class of all
persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Duke Energy securities between June
11, 2012 and July 9, 2012.  

  It is not possible to
predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to estimate the
damages, if any, that Duke Energy might incur in connection with these
lawsuits. Additional lawsuits may be filed.  

    Alaskan
Global Warming Lawsuit.     On February 26, 2008, plaintiffs, the governing
bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska, filed suit in the U.S. Federal Court
for the Northern District of California against Peabody Coal and various oil
and power company defendants, including Duke Energy and certain of its
subsidiaries. Plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and on behalf
of the village s 400 residents. The lawsuit alleges that defendants  emissions
of CO 2  contributed to global warming and constitute a private and
public nuisance. Plaintiffs also allege that certain defendants, including Duke
Energy, conspired to mislead the public with respect to global warming. The plaintiffs
in the case have requested damages in the range of $  95   million to $400 million related to the cost of
relocating the Village of Kivalina. On June 30, 2008, the defendants filed a
motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, together with a motion to dismiss
the conspiracy claims. On October 15, 2009, the District Court granted
defendants  motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held argument in the case on
November 28, 2011. On September 21, 2012, the Court of Appeals ruled that the
case could not proceed, affirming the District Court s motion to dismiss. The
Plaintiffs have filed a motion for rehearing    en banc    by the Court of
Appeals, which was denied on November 27, 2012. A Petition for Certiorari to
the U.S. Supreme Court, if filed, was due on February 25, 2013. Although Duke
Energy believes the likelihood of loss is remote based on current case law, it
is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter.   

    Price
Reporting Cases.     A
total of five lawsuits were filed against Duke Energy affiliates and other
energy companies and remain pending in a consolidated, single federal court
proceeding in Nevada.   

  In
November 2009, the judge granted defendants  motion for reconsideration of the
denial of defendants  summary judgment motion in two of the remaining five
cases to which Duke Energy affiliates are a party. A hearing on that motion
occurred on July 15, 2011, and on July 19, 2011, the judge granted
the motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held argument on October
19, 2012.   

  Each of
these cases contains similar claims, that the respective plaintiffs, and the
classes they claim to represent, were harmed by the defendants  alleged
manipulation of the natural gas markets by various means, including providing
false information to natural gas trade publications and entering into unlawful
arrangements and agreements in violation of the antitrust laws of the
respective states. Plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts. It is not
possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to estimate
the damages, if any, that Duke Energy might incur in connection with the
remaining matters. However, based on Duke Energy s past experiences with
similar cases of this nature, it does not believe its exposure under these
remaining matters is material.   

    Duke
Energy International Paranapanema Lawsuit.     On July 16, 2008,
Duke Energy International Geracao Paranapanema S.A. (DEIGP) filed a lawsuit in
the Brazilian federal court challenging transmission fee assessments imposed
under two new resolutions promulgated by the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory
Agency (ANEEL) (collectively, the Resolutions). The Resolutions purport to
impose additional transmission fees (retroactive to July 1, 2004 and
effective through June 30, 2009) on generation companies located in the
State of S o Paulo for utilization of the electric transmission system. The new
charges are based upon a flat-fee that fails to take into account the
locational usage by each generator. DEIGP s additional assessment under these
Resolutions amounts to approximately $  61   million, inclusive of interest, through December
2012. Based on DEIGP s continuing refusal to tender payment of the disputed
sums, on April 1, 2009, ANEEL imposed an additional fine against DEIGP in
the current amount of $9 million. DEIGP filed a request to enjoin payment of
the fine and for an expedited decision on the merits or, alternatively, an
order requiring that all disputed sums be deposited in the court s registry in
lieu of direct payment to the distribution companies.   

  On
June 30, 2009, the court issued a ruling in which it granted DEIGP s
request for injunction regarding the additional fine, but denied DEIGP s
request for an expedited decision on the original assessment or payment into
the court registry. Under the court s order, DEIGP was required to make
installment payments on the original assessment directly to the distribution
companies pending resolution on the merits. DEIGP filed an appeal and on
August 28, 2009, the order was modified to allow DEIGP to deposit the
disputed portion of each installment, which was most of the assessed amount,
into an escrow account pending resolution on the merits. Duke Energy has made
deposits to escrow of $  33  
million associated with this matter.

Brazil Expansion Lawsuit.     On August 9,
2011, the State of S o Paulo filed a lawsuit in Brazilian state court against
DEIGP based upon a claim that DEIGP is under a continuing obligation to expand
installed generation capacity by 15 percent pursuant to a stock purchase
agreement under which DEIGP purchased generation assets from the state. On
August 10, 2011, a judge granted an ex parte injunction ordering DEIGP to
present a detailed expansion plan in satisfaction of the 15 percent
obligation. DEIGP has previously taken a position that the 15 percent
expansion obligation is no longer viable given the changes that have occurred
in the electric energy sector since privatization of that sector. After
filing various objections, defenses and appeals regarding the referenced order,
DEIGP submitted its proposed expansion plan on November 11, 2011, but
reserved its objections regarding enforceability. The parties will in due
course present evidence to the court regarding their respective positions. No
trial date has been set.   

     Crescent
Litigation.     On
September 3, 2010, the Crescent Resources Litigation Trust filed suit
against Duke Energy along with various affiliates and several individuals,
including current and former employees of Duke Energy, in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Western District of Texas. The Crescent Resources Litigation
Trust was established in May 2010 pursuant to the plan of reorganization
approved in the Crescent bankruptcy proceedings in the same court. The
complaint alleges that in 2006 the defendants caused Crescent to borrow
approximately $  1.2  
billion from a consortium of banks and immediately thereafter distribute most
of the loan proceeds to Crescent s parent company without benefit to Crescent.
The complaint further alleges that Crescent was rendered insolvent by the
transactions, and that the distribution is subject to recovery by the Crescent
bankruptcy estate as an alleged fraudulent transfer. The plaintiff requests
return of the funds as well as other statutory and equitable relief, punitive
damages and attorneys  fees. Duke Energy and its affiliated defendants believe
that the referenced 2006 transactions were legitimate and did not violate any
state or federal law. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in December 2010. On
March 21, 2011, the plaintiff filed a response to the defendant s motion
to dismiss and a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, which was
granted. The Defendants filed a second motion to dismiss in response to
plaintiffs  amended complaint.   

  The plaintiffs
filed a demand for a jury trial, a motion to transfer the case to the federal
district court, and a motion to consolidate the case with a separate action
filed by the plaintiffs against Duke Energy s legal counsel. On March 22,
2012, the federal District Court issued an order denying the defendant s motion
to dismiss and granting the plaintiffs  motions for transfer and consolidation.
The court has not yet made a final ruling on whether the plaintiffs are
entitled to a jury trial. Trial on this matter has been set to commence in
January 2014. Mediation, held on August 21 and 22, 2012, was unsuccessful. It
is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to
estimate the damages, if any, that Duke Energy might incur in connection with
this lawsuit. The ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material
effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial
position of Duke Energy.  

     Federal
Advanced Clean Coal Tax Credits     .    Duke Energy Carolinas has been awarded $125
million of federal advanced clean coal tax credits associated with its
construction of Cliffside Unit 6 and Duke Energy Indiana has been awarded $134
million of federal advanced clean coal tax credits associated with its
construction of the Edwardsport IGCC plant. In March 2008, two environmental
groups, Appalachian Voices and the Canary Coalition, filed suit against the
Federal government in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia challenging the tax credits awarded to incentivize certain clean coal
projects. Although Duke Energy was not a party to the case, the allegations
center on the tax incentives provided for the Cliffside and Edwardsport
projects. The initial complaint alleged a failure to comply with the National Environmental
Policy Act. The first amended complaint, filed in August 2008, added an
Endangered Species Act claim and also sought declaratory and injunctive relief
against the DOE and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2008, the District
Court dismissed the case. On September 23, 2009, the District Court issued
an order granting plaintiffs  motion to amend their complaint and denying, as
moot, the motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs have filed their second
amended complaint. The Federal government has moved to dismiss the second
amended complaint; the motion is pending. On July 26, 2010, the District
Court denied plaintiffs  motion for preliminary injunction seeking to halt the issuance
of the tax credits.  

   Duke Energy Carolinas    

    New
Source Review (NSR).     In 1999-2000, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ),
acting on behalf of the EPA and joined by various citizen groups and states,
filed a number of complaints and notices of violation against multiple
utilities across the country for alleged violations of the NSR provisions of
the CAA. Generally, the government alleges that projects performed at various
coal-fired units were major modifications, as defined in the CAA, and that the
utilities violated the CAA when they undertook those projects without obtaining
permits and installing the best available emission controls for SO 2 ,
NO x  and particulate matter. The complaints seek injunctive relief to
require installation of pollution control technology on various generating
units that allegedly violated the CAA, and unspecified civil penalties in
amounts of up to $  32,500  
per day for each violation. A number of Duke Energy Carolinas  plants have been
subject to these allegations. Duke Energy Carolinas asserts that there were no
CAA violations because the applicable regulations do not require permitting in
cases where the projects undertaken are  routine  or otherwise do not result in
a net increase in emissions.   

  In 2000,
the government brought a lawsuit against Duke Energy Carolinas in the U.S.
District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina. The EPA claims that 29 projects
performed at 25 of Duke Energy Carolinas  coal-fired units violate these NSR
provisions. Three environmental groups have intervened in the case. In August
2003, the trial court issued a summary judgment opinion adopting Duke Energy
Carolinas  legal positions on the standard to be used for measuring an increase
in emissions, and granted judgment in favor of Duke Energy Carolinas. The trial
court s decision was appealed and ultimately reversed and remanded for trial by
the U.S. Supreme Court. At trial, Duke Energy Carolinas will continue to assert
that the projects were routine or not projected to increase emissions. On
February 11, 2011, the trial judge held an initial status conference and
on March 22, 2011, the judge entered an interim scheduling order. The
parties have filed a stipulation in which the United States and
Plaintiff-Intervenors have dismissed with prejudice 16 claims. In exchange,
Duke Energy Carolinas dismissed certain affirmative defenses. The parties have
filed motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims. No trial date has
been set, but a trial is not expected until the second half of 2013, at the
earliest.   

  It is
not possible to estimate the damages, if any, that might be incurred in
connection with the unresolved matters related to Duke Energy Carolinas
discussed above. Ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material
effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial
position of Duke Energy Carolinas. However, the appropriate regulatory
treatment will be pursued for any costs incurred in connection with such
resolution.   

     Asbestos-related
Injuries and Damages Claims.     Duke Energy Carolinas has experienced
numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement relating to
damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use
of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities
conducted on its electric generation plants prior to 1985. As of December 31,
2012,

there were 111 asserted claims for
non-malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to $27 million, and
49 asserted claims for malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up
to $17 million. Based on Duke Energy Carolinas  experience, it is expected that
the ultimate resolution of most of these claims likely will be less than the
amount claimed.   

  Amounts
recognized as asbestos-related reserves related to Duke Energy Carolinas in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $751 million and $  801   million as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively, and are classified in Other within
Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities.
These reserves are based upon the minimum amount in Duke Energy Carolinas  best
estimate of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through
2030. Management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims
filed against Duke Energy Carolinas after 2030. In light of the uncertainties
inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe that they can
reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred
after 2030 related to such potential claims. Asbestos-related loss estimates
incorporate anticipated inflation, if applicable, and are recorded on an
undiscounted basis. These reserves are based upon current estimates and are
subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. A
significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed, the nature
of the alleged injury, and the average cost of resolving each such claim could
change our estimated liability, as could any substantial or favorable verdict
at trial. A federal legislative solution, further state tort reform or structured
settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability. Given the
uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous
other factors outside our control, management believes that it is possible Duke
Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded
reserves.   

   Duke
Energy Carolinas has a third-party insurance policy to cover certain losses
related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self
insured retention of $476 million. Duke Energy Carolinas  cumulative payments
began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy in 2008.
Future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by Duke Energy
Carolinas  third party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit for
potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost
claim payments is $  935  
million in excess of the self insured retention. Insurance recoveries of $781
million and $813 million related to this policy are classified in the
respective Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other within Investments and Other
Assets and Receivables as of both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011,
respectively. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding
the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Management believes the insurance
recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to
have a strong financial strength rating.  

   Progress Energy    

    Synthetic Fuels
Matters.     In October 2009, a jury delivered a verdict in a lawsuit
against Progress Energy and a number of its subsidiaries and affiliates arising
out of an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of October 19, 1999, and amended as
of August 23, 2000 (the Asset Purchase Agreement) by and among U.S. Global, LLC
(Global); Earthco synthetic fuels facilities (Earthco); certain affiliates of
Earthco; EFC Synfuel LLC (which was owned indirectly by Progress Energy) and
certain of its affiliates, including Solid Energy LLC; Solid Fuel LLC; Ceredo
Synfuel LLC; Gulf Coast Synfuel LLC (renamed Sandy River Synfuel LLC)
(collectively, the Progress Affiliates), as amended by an amendment to the
Asset Purchase Agreement. In a case filed in the Circuit Court for Broward
County, Florida. in March 2003 (the Florida Global Case), Global requested an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages, as well as declaratory relief.
Global asserted (i) that pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, it was
entitled to an interest in two synthetic fuels facilities previously owned by
the Progress Affiliates and an option to purchase additional interests in the
two synthetic fuels facilities and (ii) that it was entitled to damages because
the Progress Affiliates prohibited it from procuring purchasers for the
synthetic fuels facilities. As a result of the 2007 expiration of the Internal
Revenue Code Section 29 tax credit program, all of Progress Energy s synthetic
fuels businesses were abandoned and the synthetic fuels businesses were
reclassified as discontinued operations.  

  The
jury awarded Global $78 million. In November 2009, the court assessed $  55   million in prejudgment
interest and entered judgment in favor of Global in a total amount of $133
million. In December 2009, Progress Energy appealed the Broward County judgment
to the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals. Also, in December 2009, Progress
Energy made a $  154  
million payment, which represented payment of the total judgment and a required
premium equivalent to two years of interest, to the Broward County Clerk of
Court bond account. Progress Energy continued to accrue interest related to
this judgment.   

  On
October 3, 2012, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed the
lower court ruling and directed a verdict on damages under the Commission and
Services Agreement, which was modified by the court s December 12, 2012 ruling
on Global s motion for reconsideration. The court held that Global was entitled
to 59 percent of its claim, or approximately $  90   million of the $154 million paid into the
registry of the court. Progress Energy was entitled to a refund of the
remainder of the funds. Progress Energy received and recorded a $63 million
pretax gain for the refund in December 2012. The gain was recorded in Income
from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.   

  The
case was remanded to the trial court to determine whether specific performance
is an appropriate remedy for the claims under the Asset Purchase Agreement. The
plaintiff seeks specific performance of an award of the corporate interests in
the Progress Affiliates it claims it was entitled to receive under the Asset
Purchase Agreement as of the date the jury determined the breach of contract
occurred (March 19, 2002). The Progress Affiliates contend that specific
performance is an inapplicable remedy.  

  In
a second suit filed in the Superior Court for Wake County, N.C.,    Progress
Synfuel Holdings, Inc. et al. v. U.S. Global, LLC    (the North Carolina
Global Case), the Progress Affiliates seek declaratory relief consistent with
our interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Global was served with the
North Carolina Global Case on April 17, 2003. In May 2003, Global moved to
dismiss the North Carolina Global Case for lack of personal jurisdiction over
Global. In the alternative, Global requested that the court decline to exercise
its discretion to hear the Progress Affiliates  declaratory judgment action. In
August 2003, the Wake County Superior Court denied Global s motion to dismiss,
but stayed the North Carolina Global Case, pending the outcome of the Florida
Global Case. The Progress Affiliates appealed the superior court s order
staying the case. By order dated September 7, 2004, the North Carolina Court of
Appeals dismissed the Progress Affiliates  appeal. Based upon the verdict in the
Florida Global Case, Progress Energy anticipates dismissal of the North
Carolina Global Case.

Spent Nuclear Fuel
Matters     .
   Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act of 1982, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida entered into
contracts with the DOE under which the DOE agreed to begin taking spent nuclear
fuel by no later than January 31, 1998. All similarly situated utilities were
required to sign the same Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel.

The
DOE failed to begin taking spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. In January
2004, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida filed a complaint
in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the United States, claiming that
the DOE breached the standard contract and asserting damages incurred through
2005. In 2011, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a ruling to award
Progress Energy Carolinas substantially all their asserted damages. As a
result, Progress Energy Carolinas recorded the award as an offset for past
spent fuel storage costs incurred.  

  On
December 12, 2011, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida filed
another complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the United
States, claiming damages incurred from January 1, 2006 through December 31,
2010. The damages stem from the same breach of contract asserted in the
previous litigation. On March 23, 2012, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress
Energy Florida filed their initial disclosure of $  113   million of damages with the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims and the DOE. The total amount of damages could change during discovery,
which is set to end on May 15, 2013. Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress
Energy Florida may file subsequent damage claims as they incur additional
costs. A status conference to discuss trial dates is scheduled for May 10,
2013. Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida cannot predict the
outcome of this matter.   

   Duke
Energy Ohio    

    Antitrust
Lawsuit.     In
January 2008, four plaintiffs, including individual, industrial and nonprofit
customers, filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Ohio in federal court in the
Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs alleged that Duke Energy Ohio (then The
Cincinnati Gas   Electric Company), conspired to provide inequitable
and unfair price advantages for certain large business consumers by entering
into non-public option agreements with such consumers in exchange for their
withdrawal of challenges to Duke Energy Ohio s pending Rate Stabilization Plan
(RSP), which was implemented in early 2005. On March 31, 2009, the
District Court granted Duke Energy Ohio s motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs filed a
motion to alter or set aside the judgment, which was denied by an order dated
March 31, 2010. In April 2010, the plaintiffs filed their appeal of that
order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which heard
argument on that appeal on January 11, 2012. On June 4, 2012, the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court s decision and remanded
the matter on all claims for trial on the merits and on July 25, 2012, the
Court denied Duke Energy Ohio s petition for an    en banc    review of the
case. On October 15, 2012, Duke Energy filed a petition for certiorari to the
United States Supreme Court, which was denied on January 14, 2013. The
plaintiffs  January 2013 mediation demand was for $160 million. It is not
possible to predict at this time whether Duke Energy Ohio will incur any
liability or to estimate the damages, if any, that may be incurred in
connection with this lawsuit.   

    Asbestos-related
Injuries and Damages Claims.     Duke Energy Ohio has been named as a
defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits related to asbestos at its electric
generating stations. The impact on Duke Energy Ohio s consolidated results of
operations, cash flows or financial position of these cases to date has not
been material. Based on estimates under varying assumptions concerning
uncertainties, such as, among others: (i) the number of contractors
potentially exposed to asbestos during construction or maintenance of Duke
Energy Ohio generating plants; (ii) the possible incidence of various
illnesses among exposed workers, and (iii) the potential settlement costs
without federal or other legislation that addresses asbestos tort actions, Duke
Energy Ohio estimates that the range of reasonably possible exposure in
existing and future suits over the foreseeable future is not material. This
estimated range of exposure may change as additional settlements occur and claims
are made and more case law is established.   

Other Litigation and Legal Proceedings    

The Duke
Energy Registrants are involved in other legal, tax and regulatory proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve substantial
amounts. Management believes that the final disposition of these proceedings
will not have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations, cash
flows or financial position.   

  The Duke
Energy Registrants expense legal costs related to the defense of loss
contingencies as incurred.   

  The Duke
Energy Registrants have exposure to certain legal matters that are described
herein. The Duke Energy Registrants have recorded reserves for these
proceedings and exposures as presented in the table below. These reserves
represent management s best estimate of probable loss as defined in the
accounting guidance for contingencies. The estimated reasonably possible range
of loss for non-asbestos related matters in excess of the recorded reserves is
not material. Duke Energy Carolinas has insurance coverage for certain of these
losses incurred as presented in the table below.

Other Commitments and Contingencies    

General

As part of its normal
business, the Duke Energy Registrants are a party to various financial
guarantees, performance guarantees and other contractual commitments to extend
guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries, investees
and other third parties. To varying degrees, these guarantees involve elements
of performance and credit risk, which are not included on the respective
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of any of the Duke Energy
Registrants having to honor their contingencies is largely dependent upon
future operations of various subsidiaries, investees and other third parties,
or the occurrence of certain future events.   

  In addition, the Duke
Energy Registrants enter into various fixed-price, non-cancelable commitments
to purchase or sell power (tolling arrangements or power purchase contracts), take-or-pay
arrangements, transportation or throughput agreements and other contracts that
may or may not be recognized on their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Some of these arrangements may be recognized at fair value on the respective Consolidated
Balance Sheets if such contracts meet the definition of a derivative and the NPNS
exception does not apply. In most cases, the Duke Energy Registrants purchase
obligation contracts contain provisions for price adjustments, minimum purchase
levels and other financial commitments. The commitment amounts presented below
are estimates and therefore will likely differ from actual purchase amounts.  

   Purchase
Obligations   

  The following table
presents long-term commitments that are noncancelable or are cancelable only
under certain conditions, have a term of more than one year, and that third
parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the
contracted goods or services as of December 31, 2012.   

Purchases
under the above long-term purchase agreements were $  29   million, $6 million and $  23   million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  

    Purchased
Power     

  The
Duke Energy Registrants have ongoing purchased power contracts, including
renewable energy contracts, with other utilities, certain co-generators and
qualified facilities (QFs), with expiration dates ranging from 2013 to 2032.
These purchased power contracts generally provide for capacity and energy
payments or bundled capacity and energy payments. In addition, the Duke Energy
Registrants have various contracts to secure transmission rights. Certain
purchased power agreements are classified as leases.  

  Progress
Energy Carolinas has executed certain firm contracts for purchased power with
other utilities, including tolling contracts, with expiration dates ranging
from 2017 to 2032 and representing 100 percent of plant net output. Minimum
purchases under these contracts, including those classified as leases, are
approximately $88 million, $90 million, $  91   million, $92 million and $  80   million for 2013 through 2017, respectively, and
$578 million payable thereafter.  

  Progress
Energy Florida has executed certain firm contracts for purchased power with
other utilities, including tolling contracts, with expiration dates ranging
from   2017   to 2027 and
representing between   2  
percent and 100 percent of plant net output. Minimum purchases under these
contracts, including those classified as leases, are approximately $  102   million, $102
million, $  102   million,
$71 million and $49 million for 2013 through 2017, respectively, and $381
million payable thereafter.  

  Progress
Energy Florida has ongoing purchased power contracts with certain QFs for firm
capacity with expiration dates ranging from   2013   to 2025. Energy payments are based on the actual
power taken under these contracts. Capacity payments are subject to the QFs
meeting certain contract performance obligations. These contracts account for
100 percent of the net generating capacity of each of the facilities. All ongoing
commitments have been approved by the FPSC. Minimum expected future capacity
payments under these contracts are $309 million, $  237   million, $244 million, $  273   million and $288 million for 2013 through 2017,
respectively, and $  2,440  
million payable thereafter. The FPSC allows the capacity payments to be
recovered through a capacity cost-recovery clause, which is similar to, and
works in conjunction with, energy payments recovered through the fuel
cost-recovery clause.  

  Duke
Energy Ohio has executed certain firm contracts for purchased power with other
utilities with expiration dates ranging from 2013 to   2015   and representing between 1 percent and 24 percent
of plant net output. Minimum purchases under these contracts are approximately
$316 million, $252 million and $80 million for 2013 through 2015, respectively.

Other
Purchase Obligations    

  The
long-term commitments related to Levy presented in the previous table for Duke
Energy, Progress Energy and Progress Energy Florida include only selected
components of long lead time equipment. As discussed in Note 4, Progress Energy
Florida identified a schedule shift in the Levy project, and major construction
activities on Levy have been postponed until after the NRC issues the COL for
the plants. Due to the schedule shifts, Progress Energy Florida has executed
amendments to the Levy engineering, procurement and construction (EPC)

termination. For termination without cause, the EPC agreement contains exit
provisions with termination fees, which may be significant, that vary based on
the termination circumstances. Because Progress Energy Florida has executed
amendments to the EPC agreement and anticipates negotiating additional
amendments upon receipt of the COL, Progress Energy Florida cannot currently

   Operating
and Capital Lease Commitments   

  The
Duke Energy Registrants lease assets in several areas of their operations. The
Duke Energy Registrants lease office buildings, railcars, vehicles, computer
equipment and other property and equipment with various terms and expiration
dates. Additionally, Progress Energy Carolinas has a capital lease related to
firm gas pipeline transportation capacity and as discussed under  Purchased
Power,  Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida have entered into
certain purchased power agreements, which are classified as leases. Consolidated
capitalized lease obligations are classified as Long-term debt on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of assets recorded under capital
leases is included in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.   

  The
following table presents rental expense for operating leases. These amounts are

Other Debt Matters   

  In the first quarter
of 2012, Duke Energy completed   the previously
announced sale of International Energy s indirect 25% ownership interest in
Attiki Gas Supply, S.A (Attiki), a Greek corporation, to an existing equity
owner in a series of transactions that resulted in the full discharge of the
related debt obligation. No gain or loss was recognized on these transactions.
As of December 31, 2011, Duke Energy s investment balance was $64 million and
the related debt obligation of $64 million was reflected in Current maturities
of long-term debt on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  In
September 2010, Duke Energy filed a registration statement (Form S-3) with the
SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, Duke Energy, Duke Energy
Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may issue debt and other
securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at
the time of future offerings. The registration statement also allows for the
issuance of common stock by Duke Energy.  

     On March 1, 2012, the
Progress Energy, Inc., as a well-known seasoned issuer, Progress Energy
Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida filed a combined shelf registration
statement with the SEC, which became effective upon filing with the SEC. The
registration statement is effective for three years and does not limit the
amount or number of various securities that can be issued. On July 3, 2012, the
Progress Energy, Inc. deregistered its equity securities from the registration
statement in connection with the merger, but retained its ability to issue
senior debt securities and junior subordinated debentures under the
registration statement. However, we do not expect the Progress Energy, Inc. to
issue any new securities of these types in the future. Under Progress Energy
Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s registration statements, they may
issue various long-term debt securities and preferred stock.  

  At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, $734 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, of
debt issued by Duke Energy Carolinas was guaranteed by Duke Energy.  

  On
November 13, 2012, Duke Energy filed a prospectus supplement to the September
2010 Form S-3 with the SEC, to sell up to $1 billion of fixed or variable rate
unsecured senior notes, called InterNotes, due one year to 30 years from the
date of issuance. The InterNotes will be issued as direct, unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations of Duke Energy Corporation. The net proceeds from
the sale of InterNotes will be used to fund capital expenditures in our
unregulated businesses and for general corporate purposes. The balance as of
December 31, 2012 is $36 million, with maturities ranging from 10 to 14 years.
The notes are long-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as
Long-term debt on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  On April
4, 2011, Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $1 billion of
variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form
S-3 states that no more than $500 million of the notes will be outstanding at
any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear
interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy
PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate
payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of
the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, but may be redeemed in
whole or in part by Duke Energy at any time. The notes are non-transferable and
may be redeemed in whole or in part at the investor s option. Proceeds from the
sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes. The balance as
of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, was $395 million and $79 million,
respectively. The notes are a short-term debt obligation of Duke Energy and are
reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy s Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  

  In
January 2013, Duke Energy issued $500 million of unsecured junior subordinated
debentures, which carry a fixed interest rate of 5.125%, are callable at par
after five years and mature January 15, 2073. Proceeds from the issuance were
used to redeem at par $300 million of 7.10% junior subordinated debt in
February 2013, with the remainder to repay a portion of commercial paper at it
matures, to fund capital expenditures of our unregulated businesses and for
general corporate purposes.  

   Money
Pool       

  The
Subsidiary Registrants receive support for their short-term borrowing needs
through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a
money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term
funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this
arrangement. The money pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants
separately manage their cash needs and working capital requirements.
Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and payables between the
money pool participants. Per the terms of the money pool arrangement the parent
company, Duke Energy, may loan funds to its participating subsidiaries, but may
not borrow funds through the money pool. Accordingly, as the money pool
activity is between Duke Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries, all money
pool balances are eliminated within Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  Prior to
the merger with Duke Energy, Progress Energy s subsidiaries participated in
internal money pools, administered by Progress Energy Service Company, LLC, to
more effectively utilize cash resources and reduce external short-term
borrowings. The utility money pool allowed Progress Energy Carolinas and
Progress Energy Florida to lend to and borrow from each other. The non-utility
money pool allowed unregulated operations to lend to and borrow from each
other. The Progress Energy parent could lend money to the utility and
non-utility money pools but could not borrow funds.   

  Money pool
receivable balances are reflected within Notes receivable from affiliated
companies on the respective Subsidiary Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets
and money pool payable balances are reflected within either Notes payable to
affiliated companies or Long-term debt payable to affiliated companies on the
respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  Increases
or decreases in money pool receivables are reflected within   investing activities
on the respective Subsidiary Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows, while increases or decreases in money pool borrowings are reflected
within financing activities on the respective Subsidiary Registrants
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Maturities
and Call Options       

(a)  

At December 31, 2012,
  capital leases of Duke Energy included $158 million and $907 million of
  capital lease purchase accounting adjustments for Progress Energy Carolinas
  and Progress Energy Florida, respectively, related to power purchase
  agreements that are not accounted for as leases on their financial statements
  because of grandfathering provisions in GAAP.  

The
Duke Energy Registrants have the ability under certain debt facilities to call
and repay the obligation prior to its scheduled maturity. Therefore, the actual
timing of future cash repayments could be materially different than as
presented above.   

   Available Credit
Facilities    

  In
November 2011, Duke Energy entered into a $6 billion, 5-year master credit
facility, expiring in November 2016, with $4 billion available at closing and
the remaining $2 billion became available July 2, 2012, following the closing
of the merger with Progress Energy. In October 2012, the Duke Energy Registrants
reached an agreement with banks representing $5.63 billion of commitments under
the master credit facility to extend the expiration date by one year to
November 2017. Through November 2016, the available credit under this facility
remains at $6 billion. The Duke Energy Registrants each have borrowing capacity
under the master credit facility up to specified sub limits for each borrower.
However, Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or
decrease the borrowing sub limits of each borrower, subject to a maximum
sublimit for each borrower. See the table below for the borrowing sub limits
for each of the borrowers as of December 31, 2012. The amount available under
the master credit facility has been reduced, as indicated in the table below,
by the use of the master credit facility to backstop the issuances of
commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable rate demand tax-exempt
bonds that may be put to the Company at the option of the holder. As indicated,
borrowing sub limits for the Subsidiary Registrants are also reduced for certain
amounts outstanding under the money pool arrangement.  

Short-term
Obligations Classified as Long-term Debt   

  At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be
put to the Company at the option of the holder, commercial paper issuances and
money pool borrowings were classified as Long-term debt on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. These variable rate tax-exempt bonds, commercial paper
issuances and money pool borrowings, which are short-term obligations by
nature, are classified as long term due to Duke Energy s intent and ability to
utilize such borrowings as long-term financing. As Duke Energy s master credit
facility has non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of the balance sheet
date, Duke Energy has the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on
a long-term basis. The following tables show short-term obligations classified
as long-term debt.

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

In January 2012, Duke
Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky collectively entered into a $156
million 2-year bilateral letter of credit agreement, under which Duke Energy
Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky may request the issuance of letters of credit
up to $129 million and $27 million, respectively, on their behalf to support
various series of variable rate demand bonds. In addition, Duke Energy Indiana
entered into a $78 million 2-year bilateral letter of credit facility. These
credit facilities may not be used for any purpose other than to support the
variable rate demand bonds issued by Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy
Kentucky. In February 2012, letters of credit were issued corresponding to the
amount of the facilities to support various series of tax-exempt bonds at Duke
Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky. In February 2013, the letters of
credit were amended to extend the expiration date to January 2015.  

   Restrictive
Debt Covenants    

  The
Duke Energy Registrants  debt and credit agreements contain various financial
and other covenants. The master credit facility contains a covenant requiring
the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower. Failure
to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in
accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31,
2012, each of the Duke Energy Registrants were in compliance with all covenants
related to its significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements
may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to
nonpayment, or the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the
borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the significant debt or credit
agreements contain material adverse change clauses.  

   Other
Loans    

  During
2012 and 2011, Duke Energy had loans outstanding against the cash surrender
value of the life insurance policies that it owns on the lives of its
executives. The amounts outstanding were $496 million and $457 million as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The amounts outstanding were carried
as a reduction of the related cash surrender value that is included in Other
within Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

7. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS    

Duke
Energy and its subsidiaries have various financial and performance guarantees
and indemnifications, which are issued in the normal course of business. As
discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, stand-by
letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. Duke
Energy and its subsidiaries enter into these arrangements to facilitate
commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the
transaction to the third party. At December 31, 2012, Duke Energy and its
subsidiaries do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance
under these guarantees. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of
the activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  On
January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas
businesses to shareholders. Guarantees that were issued by Duke Energy or its
affiliates, or were assigned to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained
with Duke Energy subsequent to the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra
Energy Capital, LLC, formerly known as Duke Capital LLC, (Spectra Capital) or
its affiliates prior to the spin-off remained with Spectra Capital subsequent
to the spin-off, except for guarantees that were later assigned to Duke Energy.
Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Capital against any losses incurred under certain
of the guarantee obligations that remain with Spectra Capital. At December 31,
2012, the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these
guarantees was $141 million, the majority of which expires by 2028.   

  Duke
Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties
that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain
non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of certain
non-consolidated entities and less than wholly owned consolidated entities. If
such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke Energy would be
required under the guarantees to make payments on the obligations of the less
than wholly owned entity. The maximum potential amount of future payments Duke
Energy could have been required to make under these guarantees as of December
31, 2012,  was $243 million. Of this amount, $44 million relates to guarantees
issued on behalf of less than wholly owned consolidated entities, with the
remainder related to guarantees issued on behalf of third parties and
unconsolidated affiliates of Duke Energy.   

  Of the
guarantees noted above, $93 million of the guarantees expire between 2013 and
2028, with the remaining performance guarantees having no contractual
expiration.   

  Included
in the maximum potential amount of future payments discussed above is $26
million of maximum potential amounts of future payments associated with
guarantees issued to customers or other third parties related to the payment or
performance obligations of certain entities that were previously wholly owned
by Duke Energy but which have been sold to third parties, such as
DukeSolutions, Inc. (DukeSolutions). These guarantees are primarily related to
payment of lease obligations, debt obligations, and performance guarantees
related to provision of goods and services. Duke Energy received
indemnification from the buyer of DukeSolutions for the first $2.5 million paid
by Duke Energy related to the DukeSolutions guarantees. Further, Duke Energy
granted indemnification to the buyer of DukeSolutions with respect to losses
arising under some energy services agreements retained by DukeSolutions after
the sale, provided that the buyer agreed to bear   100  % of the performance risk and 50% of any other
risk up to an aggregate maximum of $2.5 million (less any amounts paid by the
buyer under the indemnity discussed above). Additionally, for certain
performance guarantees, Duke Energy has recourse to subcontractors involved in
providing services to a customer. These guarantees have various terms ranging
from 2013 to 2021, with others having no specific term.  

  Duke Energy has
guaranteed certain issuers of surety bonds, obligating itself to make payment
upon the failure of a former non-wholly owned entity to honor its obligations
to a third party, as well as used bank-issued stand-by letters of credit to
secure the performance of non-wholly owned entities to a third party or
customer. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations that
are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of
the non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying
contract. Substantially all of these guarantees issued by Duke Energy relate to
projects at Crescent that were under development at the time of the joint
venture creation in 2006. Crescent filed Chapter 11 petitions in a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in June 2009. During 2009, Duke Energy determined that it was
probable that it will be required to perform under certain of these guarantee
obligations and recorded a charge of $  26   million associated with these obligations, which
represented Duke Energy s best estimate of its

exposure
under these guarantee obligations. At the time the charge was recorded, the
face value of the guarantees was $70 million, which has since been reduced to $  18   million as of December
31, 2012, as Crescent continues to complete some of its obligations under these
guarantees.  

  Duke Energy has
entered into various indemnification agreements related to purchase and sale
agreements and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other
third parties. These agreements typically cover environmental, tax, litigation
and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and
covenants. Typically, claims may be made by third parties for various periods
of time, depending on the nature of the claim. Duke Energy s potential exposure
under these indemnification agreements can range from a specified amount, such
as the purchase price, to an unlimited dollar amount, depending on the nature
of the claim and the particular transaction. With the exception of the $217
million at Progress Energy discussed as follows, Duke Energy is unable to
estimate the total potential amount of future payments under these
indemnification agreements due to several factors, such as the unlimited
exposure under certain guarantees.  

  Progress
Energy has issued indemnifications for certain asset performance, legal, tax
and environmental matters to third parties, including indemnifications made in
connection with sales of businesses. At December 31, 2012, the estimated
maximum exposure for these indemnifications for which a maximum exposure is
determinable was $  217  
million, including $42 million at Progress Energy Florida. Related to the sales
of businesses, the latest specified notice period extends until 2013 for the
majority of legal, tax and environmental matters provided for in the
indemnification provisions. Indemnifications for the performance of assets
extend to 2016. For certain matters for which Progress Energy receives timely
notice, indemnity obligations may extend beyond the notice period. Certain
indemnifications related to discontinued operations have no limitations as to
time or maximum potential future payments. At December 31, 2012 and 2011,
Progress Energy had recorded liabilities related to indemnifications to third
parties of $25 million and $63 million, respectively. These amounts included $17
million and $37 million for Progress Energy Florida at December 31, 2012 and
2011, respectively. These liabilities decreased primarily due to the reversal
of certain environmental indemnification liabilities for which the
indemnification period has expired and the adjustment to the indemnification
for the estimated future years  joint owner replacement power costs through the
end of the Crystal River Unit 3 joint owner contract. Progress Energy Florida s
liabilities decreased primarily due to the previously mentioned indemnification
adjustment related to Crystal River Unit 3. During the years ended December 31,
2012 and 2011, accruals and expenditures related to indemnifications were not
material.   

  In
addition, Progress Energy has issued $300 million in guarantees for certain
payments of two wholly owned indirect subsidiaries, FPC Capital I Trust and
Florida Progress Funding Corporation (Funding Corp.). The guarantees expired
February 1, 2013, with the redemption of the associated notes and securities. See
Note 18 for additional information.  

  At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets for the guarantees and indemnifications mentioned above was $  41   million and $19
million, respectively. This amount is primarily recorded in Other within
Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
liability for 2011 excludes Progress Energy as Progress Energy was acquired
July 2, 2012. As current estimates change, additional losses related to
guarantees and indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may
be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the future.  

8.     Joint Ownership of Generating and Transmission
Facilities   

The Duke Energy
Registrants hold ownership interests in certain jointly owned generating
facilities. The Duke Energy Registrants are entitled to shares of the
generating capability and output of each unit equal to their respective
ownership interests. The Duke Energy Registrants also pays their ownership
share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory purchases and operating
expenses, except in certain instances where agreements have been executed to
limit certain joint owners  maximum exposure to the additional costs. The Duke
Energy Registrants share of revenues and operating costs of the jointly owned
generating facilities is included within the corresponding line in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each participant in the jointly owned
facilities must provide its own financing, except in certain instances where
agreements have been executed to limit certain joint owners  maximum exposure
to the additional costs.  

  Duke Energy Carolinas,
along with North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number 1, North Carolina
Electric Membership Corporation and Piedmont Municipal Power Agency, have joint
ownership of Catawba, which is a facility operated by Duke Energy Carolinas.   

  Progress Energy
Carolinas, along with North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency, have joint
ownership of Mayo Station, Harris, Brunswick and Roxboro Station Unit No. 4,
which are facilities operated by Progress Energy Carolinas.  

  Progress Energy
Florida, along with Seminole Electric Cooperative, Inc., City of Ocala, Orlando
Utilities Commission, City of Gainesville, City of Leesburg, Kissimmee Utility
Authority, Utilities Commission of the City of New Smyrna Beach, City of
Alachua and City of Bushnell, have joint ownership of Crystal River Unit 3.
Additionally, Progress Energy Florida is a joint owner of Intercession City
Station Unit No. P11 with Georgia Power Company. These facilities are operated
by Progress Energy Florida.  

  Duke Energy Ohio and
subsidiaries of American Electric Power Company. Inc. and/or The AES
Corporation jointly own electric generating units and related transmission
facilities in Ohio and Kentucky.   

  Duke Energy Indiana
and WVPA jointly own Vermillion Station. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana is a
joint-owner of Gibson Station Unit No. 5 with WVPA and Indiana Municipal Power
Agency (IMPA), as well as a joint-owner with WVPA and IMPA of certain Indiana
transmission property and local facilities. These facilities constitute part of
the integrated transmission and distribution systems, which are operated and
maintained by Duke Energy Indiana.

9.      Asset Retirement Obligations   

Asset retirement obligations,
which represent legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain
tangible long-lived assets, are computed as the present value of the projected
costs for the future     retirement of specific
assets and are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred, if
a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the
liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset in the period
the liability is incurred and this additional carrying amount is depreciated
over the remaining life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial recognition,
the liability is adjusted for any revisions to the estimated future cash flows
associated with the asset retirement obligation (with corresponding adjustments
to property, plant, and equipment), which can occur due to a number of factors
including, but not limited to, cost escalation, changes in technology
applicable to the assets to be retired and changes in federal, state or local
regulations, as well as for accretion of the liability due to the passage of
time until the obligation is settled. Depreciation expense is adjusted
prospectively for any increases or decreases to the carrying amount of the
associated asset. The recognition of asset retirement obligations has no impact
on the earnings of the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated operations as the
effects of the recognition and subsequent accounting for an asset retirement
obligation are offset by the establishment of regulatory assets and liabilities
pursuant to regulatory accounting.   

  Asset retirement
obligations recognized by Duke Energy relate primarily to the decommissioning
of nuclear power facilities, asbestos removal, closure of landfills and removal
of wind generation assets. Asset retirement obligations recognized by Duke
Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida relate
primarily to the decommissioning of nuclear power facilities, asbestos removal
and closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Asset retirement
obligations at Duke Energy Ohio relate primarily to the retirement of gas
mains, asbestos abatement at certain generating stations and closure and
post-closure activities of landfills. Asset retirement obligations at Duke
Energy Indiana relate primarily to obligations associated with future asbestos
abatement at certain generating stations and closure and post-closure
activities of landfills. Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants  assets have an
indeterminate life, such as transmission and

(c)  

For Progress Energy and Progress Energy Florida, the amounts
  relate to the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3.

  for the types of estimated costs in the asset retirement obligations.  

(e)  

Includes $7 million reported in Other current liabilities on the
  Consolidated Balance Sheets at Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Progress
  Energy Carolinas.  

The Duke Energy
Registrants  regulated operations accrue costs of removal for property that
does not have an associated legal retirement obligation based on regulatory
orders from the various state commissions. These costs of removal are recorded
as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory treatment. The Duke
Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated cost of removal for any non regulated
assets. See Note 4 for the estimated cost of removal for assets without an
associated legal retirement obligation, which are included in Regulatory Liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.   

   Nuclear
Decommissioning Costs.    

  In 2010, the NCUC and
PSCSC approved the retail portion of a total $48 million annual amount for
contributions and expense levels for decommissioning for Duke Energy Carolinas.
In each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Duke Energy
Carolinas expensed $48 million and contributed cash of $48 million to the NDTF
for decommissioning costs. In 2010, the NCUC and the PSCSC approved the retail
portion of a total $31 million annual amount for contributions and expense
levels for decommissioning for Progress Energy Carolinas. In each of the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Progress Energy Carolinas expensed
$31 million and contributed cash of $31 million to the NDTF for decommissioning
costs. These amounts are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
in Purchases of available-for-sale securities within Net Cash Used in Investing
Activities. The contributions for Duke Energy Carolinas were to the funds
reserved for contaminated costs as contributions to the funds reserved for
non-contaminated costs have been discontinued since the current estimates indicate
existing funds to be sufficient to cover projected future costs. The
contributions for Progress Energy Carolinas were to funds reserved for
contaminated and non-contaminated costs. Both the NCUC and the PSCSC have
allowed Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas to recover
estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected
remaining service periods of their respective nuclear stations. Duke Energy
Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas believe that the decommissioning costs
being recovered through rates, when coupled with expected fund earnings, will
be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. As discussed
below, Progress Energy Florida has suspended its accrual for nuclear
decommissioning.   

  Use of the NDTF
investments are restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the NDTF
investments are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements
of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, the NCUC, the PSCSC
and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The fair value of assets that are
legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations

associated with nuclear decommissioning are $3,941
million and $2,053 million for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas for the
year ended December 31, 2012, respectively, and $1,797 million for Duke Energy
and Duke Energy Carolinas for the year ended December 31, 2011. The NDTF
balances presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Progress Energy,
Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida represent the fair value
of assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement
obligations associated with nuclear decommissioning.  

The NCUC, PSCSC and
the FPSC require updated cost estimates for decommissioning nuclear plants
every five years.   

  Duke Energy Carolinas completed
site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies in January 2009 that showed
total estimated nuclear decommissioning costs, including the cost to
decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, of $3
billion in 2008 dollars. This estimate includes Duke Energy Carolinas 
ownership interest in its jointly owned unit. Duke Energy Carolinas filed these
site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies with the NCUC and the PSCSC
in conjunction with various rate case filings. In addition to the
decommissioning cost studies, a new funding study was completed and indicates
the current annual funding requirement of $48 million is sufficient to cover
the estimated decommissioning costs.   

  Progress Energy
Carolinas completed site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies in
December 2009, which were filed with the NCUC on March 16, 2010. Progress
Energy Carolinas estimate is based on prompt dismantlement decommissioning,
which reflects the cost of removal of all radioactive and other structures
currently at the site, with such removal occurring after operating license
expiration. These decommissioning cost estimates also include interim spent
fuel storage costs associated with maintaining spent nuclear fuel on site until
such time that it can be transferred to a DOE facility. See Note 5 for
information related to spent nuclear fuel litigation. These estimates, in 2009
dollars, were $3.0 billion. The estimates are subject to change based on a
variety of factors including, but not limited to, cost escalation, changes in
technology applicable to nuclear decommissioning and changes in federal, state
or local regulations. This estimate includes Progress Energy Carolinas ownership
interest in jointly owned units. In addition to the decommissioning cost
studies, a new funding study was completed and indicates the current annual
funding requirement of $31 million is sufficient to cover the estimated
decommissioning costs.   

  Progress Energy
Florida completed a site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study in October
2008, which was filed with the FPSC in 2009 as part of Progress Energy Florida s
base rate filing. However, the FPSC deferred review of Progress Energy Florida s
nuclear decommissioning study from the rate case to be addressed in 2010 in
order for FPSC staff to assess Progress Energy Florida s study in combination
with other utilities anticipated to submit nuclear decommissioning studies in
2010. Progress Energy Florida was not required to prepare a new site-specific
nuclear decommissioning study in 2010; however, Progress Energy Florida was
required to update the 2008 study with the most currently available escalation
rates in 2010, which was filed with the FPSC in December 2010. The FPSC
approved Progress Energy Florida s nuclear decommissioning cost study on April
30, 2012. Progress Energy Florida s estimate is based on prompt dismantlement
decommissioning and includes interim spent fuel storage costs associated with
maintaining spent nuclear fuel on site until such time that it can be
transferred to a DOE facility. See Note 5 for information related to spent
nuclear fuel litigation. The estimate, in 2008 dollars, is $751 million and is
subject to change based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to,
cost escalation, changes in technology applicable to nuclear decommissioning
and changes in federal, state or local regulations. This estimate includes
Progress Energy Florida s ownership interest in jointly owned stations. Based
on the 2008 estimate, assumed operating license renewal and updated escalation
factors in 2010, Progress Energy Florida decreased its asset retirement cost
and its asset retirement obligation by approximately $37 million in 2010. With
the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3 it is anticipated that a delayed
dismantlement approach to decommissioning referred to as SAFSTOR, will be
submitted to the NRC for approval. This decommissioning approach is currently
utilized at a number of retired domestic nuclear power plants and is one of
three generally accepted approaches to decommissioning required by the NRC.
Once an updated site specific decommissioning study is completed it will be
filed with the FPSC. As part of the evaluation of repairing Crystal River Unit
3, initial estimates of the cost to decommission the plant under the SAFSTOR
option were developed. The estimate in 2011 dollars is $989 million. Based on
the 2011 SAFSTOR estimate, Progress Energy Florida increased its asset
retirement regulatory asset and its ARO liability by approximately $234 million
in 2012. Retail accruals on Progress Energy Florida s reserves for nuclear
decommissioning were previously suspended under the terms of previous base rate
settlement agreements. Progress Energy Florida will continue this suspension
based on the FPSC s approval on April 30, 2012 of its 2010 nuclear
decommissioning filing. No nuclear decommissioning reserve accrual is recorded
at Progress Energy Florida following a FERC accounting order issued in November
2006.  

  The operating licenses
for the Duke Energy Registrants  nuclear units are subject to extension. The
following table includes the current expiration of nuclear operating licenses.

Progress Energy had Goodwill
of $  3,655   million as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, for which there are no accumulated impairment charges.  

  In the fourth quarter
of 2012, goodwill for the Renewables reporting unit within Commercial Power was
analyzed for impairment primarily as a result of changes in the tax benefits
for renewable projects. Based on results of the fourth quarter 2012 impairment
analysis, the

fair value of the Renewables reporting
unit exceeded its carrying value thus no impairment was recorded. The fair
value of the Renewables reporting unit is impacted by a multitude of factors,
including legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term
growth rate assumptions, the market price of power and discount rates.
Management continues to monitor these assumptions for any indicators that the
fair value of the reporting unit could be below the carrying value, and will
assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate.  

   Midwest
Generation Asset Impairment.    In the second quarter of 2010, based on circumstances
discussed below, management determined that it was more likely than not that
the fair value of Commercial Power s nonregulated Midwest generation reporting
unit was below its respective carrying value. Accordingly, an interim
impairment test was performed for this reporting unit. Determination of
reporting unit fair value was based on a combination of the income approach,
which estimates the fair value of Duke Energy s reporting units based on
discounted future cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates the fair
value of Duke Energy s reporting units based on market comparables within the
utility and energy industries. Based on completion of step one of the second
quarter 2010 impairment analysis, management determined that the fair value of
Commercial Power s non-regulated Midwest generation reporting unit was less
than its carrying value, which included goodwill of $  500   million.   

  Commercial
Power s nonregulated Midwest generation reporting unit includes nearly 4,000 MW
of primarily coal-fired generation capacity in Ohio which was dedicated under
the ESP through December 31, 2011. Additionally, this reporting unit has
approximately 3,600 MW of gas-fired generation capacity in Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Illinois and Indiana which provides generation to unregulated energy markets in
the Midwest. The businesses within Commercial Power s nonregulated Midwest
generation reporting unit operate in unregulated markets which allow for
customer choice among suppliers. As a result, the operations within this
reporting unit are subjected to competitive pressures that do not exist in any
of Duke Energy s regulated jurisdictions.   

  Commercial
Power s other businesses, including the renewable generation assets, are in a
separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. No impairment
existed with respect to Commercial Power s renewable generation assets.   

  The fair
value of Commercial Power s nonregulated Midwest generation reporting unit is
impacted by a multitude of factors, including current and forecasted customer
demand, forecasted power and commodity prices, uncertainty of environmental
costs, competition, the cost of capital, valuation of peer companies and
regulatory and legislative developments. Management s assumptions and views of
these factors continually evolve, and certain views and assumptions used in
determining the fair value of the reporting unit in the 2010 interim impairment
test changed significantly from those used in the 2009 annual impairment test.
These factors had a significant impact on the valuation of Commercial Power s
nonregulated Midwest generation reporting unit. More specifically, the
following factors significantly impacted management s valuation of the
reporting unit:   

Sustained
lower forward power prices   In Ohio, Duke Energy s Commercial Power segment
provided power to retail customers under the ESP, which utilizes rates approved
by the PUCO through 2011. These rates in 2010 were above market prices for
generation services, resulting in customers switching to other generation
providers. As discussed in Note 4, Duke Energy Ohio will establish a new SSO
for retail load customers for generation after the current ESP expires on
December 31, 2011. Given forward power prices, which declined from the time of
the 2009 impairment, significant uncertainty existed with respect to the
generation margin that would be earned under the new SSO.   

Potentially
more stringent environmental regulations from the U.S. EPA In May and July of
2010, the EPA issued proposed rules associated with the regulation of CCRs to
address risks from the disposal of CCRs (e.g., ash ponds) and to limit the
interstate transport of emissions of NO x  and SO 2 . These
proposed regulations, along with other pending EPA regulations, could result in
significant expenditures for coal fired generation plants, and could result in
the early retirement of certain generation assets, which do not currently have
control equipment for NO x  and SO2, as soon as 2014.   

Customer
switching   ESP customers have increasingly selected alternative generation
service providers, as allowed by Ohio legislation, which further erodes margins
on sales. In the second quarter of 2010, Duke Energy Ohio s residential class
became the target of an intense marketing campaign offering significant
discounts to residential customers that switch to alternate power suppliers.
Customer switching levels were at approximately 55% at June 30, 2010 compared
to approximately   29  %
in the third quarter of 2009.   

  As a
result of the factors above, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $500
million was recorded during the second quarter of 2010. This impairment charge
represented the entire remaining goodwill balance for Commercial Power s
non-regulated Midwest generation reporting unit. In addition to the goodwill
impairment charge, and as a result of factors similar to those described above,
Commercial Power recorded $160 million of pre-tax impairment charges related to
certain generating assets and emission allowances primarily associated with
these generation assets in the Midwest to write-down the value of these assets
to their estimated fair value. The generation assets that were subject to this
impairment charge were those coal-fired generating assets that do not have
certain environmental emissions control equipment, causing these generation
assets to be heavily impacted by the EPA s proposed rules on emissions of NOx
and SO2. These impairment charges are recorded in Goodwill and Other Impairment
Charges on Duke Energy s Consolidated Statement of Operations.

August 8, 2011, the EPA s final rule to replace CAIR was published in the
Federal Register. As further discussed in Note 5, the CSAPR established
state-level annual SO 2  and NO x  caps that were required to
take effect on January 1, 2012, and state-level ozone-season NO x 
caps that were to take effect on May 1, 2012. The CSAPR did not utilize CAA
emission allowances as the original CAIR provided. Under the CSAPR, the EPA was
expected to issue new emission allowances to be used exclusively for purposes
of complying with the CSAPR cap-and-trade program. After this ruling was
published in 2011, Duke Energy evaluated the effect of the CSAPR on the
carrying value of emission allowances recorded at its USFE G and Commercial
Power segments. Based on the provisions of the CSAPR, Duke Energy Ohio had more
SO 2  allowances than were needed to comply with the continuing CAA
acid rain cap-and-trade program (excess emission allowances). Duke Energy Ohio
incurred a pre-tax impairment of $79 million in 2011 to write down the carrying
value of excess emission allowances held by Commercial Power to fair value. The
charge is recorded in Impairment charges on Duke Energy and Duke Energy Ohio s
Consolidated Statement of Operations. This amount was based on the fair value
of excess allowances held by Commercial Power for compliance under the
continuing CAA acid rain cap-and-trade program as of September 30, 2011.

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES    

Investments
in domestic and international affiliates that are not controlled by Duke
Energy, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using
the equity method. Significant investments in affiliates accounted for under
the equity method are discussed below.   

   Commercial
Power   

  As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011 investments accounted for under the equity
method primarily consisted of Duke Energy s approximate 50% ownership interest
in the five Sweetwater projects (Phase I-V), which own wind power assets
located in Texas. As of December 31, 2012 Duke Energy held a 50% ownership
interest in both INDU Solar Holdings, LLC and DS Cornerstone, LLC, which own
solar and wind power projects, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 Duke
Energy held a 49% ownership interest in Suez-DEGS Solutions of Ashtabula LLC,
and a 50% ownership interest in INDU Solar Holdings, LLC. Duke Energy sold its
interest in Ashtabula during 2012. The sale did not result in a significant
gain or loss.   

   International
Energy   

  As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, Duke Energy held a   25  % indirect interest in NMC, which owns and
operates a methanol and MTBE business in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. As of
December 31, 2011, Duke Energy held a 25% ownership interest in Attiki Gas
Supply, S.A (Attiki). In the first quarter of 2012, Duke Energy completed the
sale of this interest to an existing equity owner. No gain or loss was
recognized on the sale.  

   Other   

  As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, investments accounted for under the equity
method primarily include a 50% ownership interest in DukeNet, which owns and
operates telecommunications businesses.   

  On December
21, 2010, as discussed in Note 3, Duke Energy completed an agreement with
Alinda to sell a 50% ownership interest in DukeNet. As a result of the
disposition transaction, DukeNet and Alinda are equal 50% owners in the new
joint venture. The sale resulted in a $139 million pre-tax gain recorded in
Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Prior to the closing of the transaction, DukeNet was a consolidated
wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy.  

  On
December 2, 2010, Duke Energy completed the sale of its 30% equity
investment in Q-Comm to Windstream Corp. (Windstream). The sale resulted in
$165 million in net proceeds, including $  87   million of Windstream common shares and a $109
million pre-tax gain recorded in Gains on sales of unconsolidated affiliates on
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

  As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying amount of investments in
affiliates with carrying amounts greater than zero approximated the amount of
underlying equity in net assets.  

   Impairments   

  During
the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2010, Duke Energy recorded pre-tax
impairment charges to the carrying value of investments in unconsolidated
affiliates of $  6  
million and $11 million, respectively. There were no significant pre-tax
impairment charges to the

  Commercial Power had
an interest in South Houston Green Power, L.P. (SHGP), which is a cogeneration
facility containing three combustion turbines in Texas City, Texas. Although
Duke Energy owned a significant portion of SHGP, it was not consolidated as
Duke Energy did not hold a majority voting control or have the ability to
exercise control over SHGP, nor was Duke Energy the primary beneficiary. Duke
Energy exercised the cash settlement option of an asset swap agreement for SHGP
and received total cash proceeds of $184 million in December 2010. This
transaction did not result in a significant gain.

(a)  

The Subsidiary Registrants are charged their proportionate share
  of corporate governance and other costs by unconsolidated affiliates that are
  consolidated affiliates of Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Corporate
  governance and other shared services costs are primarily related to human
  resources, employee benefits, legal and accounting fees, as well as other
  third party costs. These amounts are recorded in Operation, maintenance and
  other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

(c)  

Effective with the consummation of the merger between Duke
  Energy and Progress Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy
  Carolinas began to participate in a JDA which allowed the collective dispatch
  of power plants between the service territories to reduce customer rates.
  Revenues from the sale of power under the JDA are recorded in Regulated
  electric within revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
  Comprehensive Income. Expenses from the purchase of power under the JDA are
  recorded in Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power - regulated
  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  

(d)  

Progress Energy charges a proportionate share of corporate
  governance and other costs to unconsolidated affiliates that are consolidated
  affiliates of Duke Energy. Corporate governance and other shared costs are primarily
  related to human resources, employee benefits, legal and accounting fees, as
  well as other third-party costs. These charges are recorded as an offset to
  Operation, maintenance and other in the Statements of Operations and
  Comprehensive Income.   

In addition to the amounts presented above, the
Subsidiary Registrants record income associated with the rental of office space
to consolidated affiliates of Duke Energy, as well as their proportionate share
of certain charged expenses from affiliates of Duke Energy. The Duke Energy
registrants participate in a money pool arrangement with Duke Energy and
certain of its subsidiaries. See Note 6 for more information regarding money
pool. As discussed in Note 18, certain trade receivables have been sold by Duke
Energy Ohio and Duke Energy

Indiana to CRC, an
unconsolidated entity formed by a subsidiary of Duke Energy. The proceeds
obtained from the sales of receivables are largely cash but do include a
subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the purchase price. Rental income,
interest income and interest expense on these transactions were not material
for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.   

  In January 2012, Duke Energy Ohio recorded a non-cash
equity transfer of $28 million related to the sale of Vermilion to Duke Energy
Indiana. Duke Energy Indiana recorded a non-cash after tax equity transfer of
$26 million for the purchase of Vermillion from Duke Energy Ohio. See note 2
for further discussion.   

  DECAM is a
non-regulated, direct subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio. DECAM conducts business
activities including the execution of commodity transactions, third party
vendor and supply contracts and service contracts for certain of Duke Energy s
non-regulated entities. The commodity contracts that DECAM enters either do not
qualify as hedges or are accounted for as undesignated contracts, thus the
mark-to-market impacts of these contracts are reflected in Duke Energy Ohio s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. In addition, equal
and offsetting mark-to-market impacts of intercompany contracts with non-regulated
entities are reflected in Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Income representing the pass through of the economics of the
original contracts to non-regulated entities in accordance with contractual
arrangements between Duke Energy Ohio and non-regulated entities. Because it is
not a rated entity, DECAM receives its credit support from Duke Energy or its
non-regulated subsidiaries and not the regulated utility operations of Duke
Energy Ohio. DECAM meets its funding needs through an intercompany loan
agreement from a subsidiary of Duke Energy. DECAM also has the ability to loan
money to the subsidiary of Duke Energy. DECAM had an outstanding intercompany
loan payable with the subsidiary of Duke Energy of $79 million as of December
31, 2012. This amount is recorded in Notes payable to affiliated companies on
Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Balance Sheets. DECAM had a $90 million intercompany
loan receivable with the subsidiary of Duke Energy as of December 31, 2011.
This amount is recorded in Notes receivable from affiliated companies on Duke
Energy Ohio s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed in Note 6, in August
2012, Duke Energy issued $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes. Proceeds from
the issuances were used in part to repay outstanding notes of $500 million to
DECAM, and such funds were ultimately used to repay at maturity Duke Energy
Ohio s $500 million debentures due September 15, 2012. In conjunction with the proposed
generation asset transfer discussed in Note 4, Duke Energy Ohio s capital
structure is being restructured to reflect appropriate debt and equity ratios
for its regulated Franchised Electric and Gas operations.  

15. RISK MANAGEMENT,
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    

The Duke Energy
Registrants closely monitor the risks associated with commodity price changes
and changes in interest rates on their operations and, where appropriate, use
various commodity and interest rate instruments to manage these risks. Certain
of these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting and are designated
as hedging instruments, while others either do not qualify as hedges or have
not been designated as hedges (hereinafter referred to as undesignated
contracts). The Duke Energy Registrants  primary use of energy commodity
derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to changes in
the prices of power and fuel. Interest rate swaps are entered into to manage
interest rate risk primarily associated with the Duke Energy Registrants 
variable-rate and fixed-rate borrowings.   

  The accounting
guidance for derivatives requires the recognition of all derivative instruments
not identified as NPNS as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For derivative instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting, the Duke Energy Registrants may elect to designate such derivatives
as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. The Duke Energy Registrants
offset fair value amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related
to derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same
master netting agreement.   

  The operations of the
USFE G business segment meet the criteria for regulatory accounting
treatment. Accordingly, for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges within
USFE G, gains and losses are reflected as a regulatory liability or asset
instead of as a component of AOCI. For derivatives designated as fair value
hedges or left undesignated within USFE G, gains and losses associated with
the change in fair value of these derivative contracts would be deferred as a
regulatory liability or asset, thus having no immediate earnings impact.   

  Within the Duke Energy
Registrants  unregulated businesses, for derivative instruments that qualify
for hedge accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of the gain or loss is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified
into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. Any gains or losses on the derivative that represent either
hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness are recognized in current earnings. For derivative instruments
that qualify and are designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the
derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are
recognized in earnings in the current period. The Duke Energy Registrants
include the gain or loss on the derivative in the same line item as the
offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into derivative
agreements that are economic hedges that either do not qualify for hedge
accounting or have not been designated as a hedge. The changes in fair value of
these undesignated derivative instruments are reflected in current earnings.   

   Commodity Price Risk    

  The Duke Energy
Registrants are exposed to the impact of market changes in the future prices of
electricity (energy, capacity and financial transmission rights), coal, natural
gas and emission allowances (SO 2 , seasonal NO X  and annual
NO X ) as a result of their energy operations such as electricity
generation and the transportation and sale of natural gas. With respect to
commodity price risks associated with electricity generation, the Duke Energy
Registrants are exposed to changes including, but not limited to, the cost of
the coal and natural gas used to generate electricity, the prices of
electricity in wholesale markets, the cost of capacity and electricity
purchased for resale in wholesale markets and the cost of emission allowances
primarily at the Duke Energy Registrants  coal fired power plants. Risks
associated with commodity price changes on future operations are closely
monitored and, where appropriate, various commodity contracts are used to
mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Exposure to commodity
price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to,
the term of the contract, the liquidity of the market and delivery location.   

    Commodity Fair Value
Hedges.     
   At
December 31, 2012, there were no open commodity derivative instruments that
were designated as fair value hedges.

Commodity
Cash Flow Hedges     .    At December 31, 2012, there were immaterial open
commodity derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow hedges.   

    Undesignated Contracts     .     The Duke Energy
Registrants use derivative contracts as economic hedges to manage the market
risk exposures that arise from providing electricity generation and capacity to
large energy customers, energy aggregators, retail customers and other
wholesale companies. Undesignated contracts may include contracts not
designated as a hedge, contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting,
derivatives that do not or no longer qualify for the NPNS scope exception, and
de-designated hedge contracts. These contracts expire as late as 2016.   

  Undesignated contracts
also include contracts associated with operations that Duke Energy continues to
wind down or has included as discontinued operations. As these undesignated
contracts expire as late as 2021, Duke Energy has entered into economic hedges
that leave it minimally exposed to changes in prices over the duration of these
contracts.   

  Duke Energy Carolinas
and Progress Energy Carolinas use derivative contracts as economic hedges to
manage the market risk exposures that arise from electricity generation. Duke
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas have also entered into firm
power sale agreements, which are accounted for as derivative instruments, as
part of the Interim FERC Mitigation in connection with Duke Energy s merger
with Progress Energy. See Note 2 for further information. Duke Energy
Carolinas  undesignated contracts as of December 31, 2012, are primarily
associated with forward sales and purchases of power. Progress Energy
Carolinas  undesignated contracts as of December 31, 2012, are primarily
associated with forward purchases of fuel used in electricity generation.  

  Progress Energy
Florida uses derivative contracts as economic hedges to manage the market risk
exposures that arise from electricity generation. Undesignated contracts at December
31, 2012, are primarily associated with forward purchases of fuel used in
electricity generation.  

  Duke Energy Ohio uses
derivative contracts as economic hedges to manage the market risk exposures
that arise from providing electricity generation and capacity to large energy
customers, energy aggregators, retail customers and other wholesale companies.
Undesignated contracts at December 31, 2012 are primarily associated with
forward sales and purchases of power, coal and gas for the Commercial Power segment.

Duke Energy Indiana
uses derivative contracts as economic hedges to manage the market risk
exposures that arise from electricity generation. Undesignated contracts at
December 31, 2012, are primarily associated with forward purchases and sales of
power, financial transmission rights and emission allowances.   

   Interest Rate Risk    

  The Duke Energy
Registrants are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a
result of their issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate
debt and commercial paper. Interest rate exposure is managed by limiting
variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the
effects of market changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with
changes in interest rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into financial
contracts; primarily interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury lock agreements.
Additionally, in anticipation of certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of
forward starting interest rate swaps may be executed to lock in components of
the market interest rates at the time and terminated prior to or upon the
issuance of the corresponding debt. When these transactions occur within a
business that meets the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment, these
contracts may be treated as undesignated and any pre-tax gain or loss
recognized from inception to termination of the hedges would be recorded as a
regulatory liability or asset and amortized as a component of interest expense
over the life of the debt. Alternatively, these derivatives may be designated
as hedges whereby, any pre-tax gain or loss recognized from inception to
termination of the hedges would be recorded in AOCI and amortized as a
component of interest expense over the life of the debt.

Credit Risk    

  Certain derivative
contracts of the Duke Energy Registrants contain contingent credit features,
such as material adverse change clauses or payment acceleration clauses that
could result in immediate payments, the posting of letters of credit or the
termination of the derivative contract before maturity if specific events
occur, such as a credit rating downgrade below investment grade.   

  The following table
shows information with respect to derivative contracts that are in a net
liability position and contain objective credit-risk related payment
provisions. The amounts disclosed in the table below represent the aggregate
fair value amounts of such derivative instruments at the end of the reporting
period, the aggregate fair value of assets that are already posted as
collateral under such derivative instruments at the end of the reporting
period, and the aggregate fair value of additional assets that would be
required to be transferred in the event that credit-risk-related contingent
features were triggered.   

Netting of Cash
Collateral and Derivative Assets and Liabilities Under Master Netting
Arrangements.    In
accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Duke Energy Registrants
have elected to offset fair value amounts (or amounts that approximate fair
value) recognized on their Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cash
collateral amounts receivable or payable against fair value amounts recognized
for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same
master netting agreement. The amounts disclosed in the table below represent
the receivables related to the right to reclaim cash collateral and payables
related to the obligation to return cash collateral under master netting
arrangements. See Note 16 for additional information on fair value disclosures

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES    

Under
existing accounting guidance, fair value is considered to be the exchange price
in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or
transfer a liability at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses
on an exit price, which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability versus an entry price, which would be the price
paid to acquire an asset or received to assume a liability. Fair value
measurements require the use of market data or assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions
about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
These inputs can be readily observable, corroborated by market data or
generally unobservable. Valuation techniques are required to maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A midmarket
pricing convention (the midpoint price between bid and ask prices) is permitted
for use as a practical expedient.   

  The
Duke Energy Registrants classify recurring and non-recurring fair value
measurements based on the following fair value hierarchy, as prescribed by the
accounting guidance for fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels:   

   Level 1    unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities the Duke Energy Registrants have
the ability to access. An active market for the asset or liability is one in
which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency
and volume to provide ongoing pricing information. The Duke Energy Registrants 
Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded
derivatives and listed equities.  

   Level 2    a fair value measurement utilizing
inputs other than a quoted market price that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include, but are not
limited to, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active
market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets
that are not active and inputs other than quoted market prices that are
observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate curves and yield
curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, credit risk and
default rates. A Level 2 measurement cannot have more than an insignificant
portion of the valuation based on unobservable inputs. Instruments in this
category include non-exchange-traded derivatives, such as over-the-counter
forwards, swaps and options; certain marketable debt securities; and financial
instruments traded in less than active markets.   

   Level 3    any fair value measurements which
include unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for more than an
insignificant portion of the valuation. These inputs may be used with
internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of
fair value. Level 3 instruments may include longer-term instruments that extend
into periods in which quoted prices or other observable inputs are not
available.  

  The fair
value accounting guidance for financial instruments permits entities to elect
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
that are not required to be accounted for at fair value under other GAAP. There
are no financial assets or financial liabilities that are not required to be
accounted for at fair value under GAAP for which the option to record at fair
value has been elected by the Duke Energy Registrants. However, in the future,
the Duke Energy Registrants may elect to measure certain financial instruments
at fair value in accordance with this accounting guidance.   

  Transfers
out of and into Levels 1, 2 or 3 represent existing assets or liabilities
previously categorized as a higher level for which the inputs to the estimate
became less observable or assets and liabilities that were previously
classified as Level 2 or 3 for which the lowest significant input became more
observable during the period, respectively. The Duke Energy Registrant s policy
for the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy is
to recognize the transfer at the end of the period. There were no transfers out
of or into Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2012.  

  Valuation
methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows:   

   Investments
in equity securities.    Investments
in equity securities, other than those accounted for as equity and cost method
investments, are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active
market as of the last business day of the quarter. Principal active markets for
equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign
equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency
exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. Prices
have not been adjusted to reflect for after-hours market activity. The majority
of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. For
certain investments that are valued on a net asset value per share (or its
equivalent), or the net asset value basis, when the Duke Energy Registrants do
not have the ability to redeem the investment in the near term at net asset
value per share (or its equivalent), or the net asset value is not available as
of the measurement date, the fair value measurement of the investment is
categorized as Level 3.   

   Investments
in available-for-sale auction rate securities.    Duke Energy and Duke
Energy Carolinas hold auction rate securities for which an active market does
not currently exist. During the year ended December 31, 2012, $55 million of
these investments in auction rate securities were redeemed at full par value
plus accrued interest. Auction rate securities held are student loan securities
for which at December 31, 2012 approximately 84% is ultimately backed by the
U.S. government. At December 31, 2012, approximately 24% of these securities
are AAA rated. As of December 31, 2012, and 2011 all of these auction rate
securities are classified as long-term investments and are valued using Level 3
measurements. The methods and significant assumptions used to determine the
fair values of the investment in auction rate debt securities represent
estimations of fair value using internal discounted cash flow models which
incorporate primarily management s own assumptions as to the term over which
such investments will be recovered at par (ranging from 7 to 17 years), the
current level of interest rates (less than 0.3%), and the appropriate
risk-adjusted discount rates (up to 4.2% reflecting a tenor of up to 17 years).

valuations, all significant value
drivers were considered, including the underlying collateral (primarily
evaluated on the basis of credit ratings, parity ratios and the percentage of
loans backed by the U.S. government).   

  There
were no other-than-temporary impairments associated with investments in auction
rate debt securities during the years ended December 31, 2012 or 2011.   

   Investments
in debt securities.   
Most debt investments, including those held in the Nuclear Decommissioning
Trust Funds (NDTF), are valued based on a calculation using interest rate
curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity
and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most
debt valuations are Level 2 measurements. If the market for a particular fixed
income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is a Level
3 measurement. U.S. Treasury debt is typically a Level 1 measurement.  

   Commodity
derivatives.   
The pricing for commodity derivatives is primarily a calculated value which
incorporates the forward price and is adjusted for liquidity (bid-ask spread),
credit or non-performance risk (after reflecting credit enhancements such as
collateral) and discounted to present value. The primary difference between a
Level 2 and a Level 3 measurement relates to the level of activity in forward
markets for the commodity. If the market is relatively inactive, the
measurement is deemed to be a Level 3 measurement. Commodity derivatives with
clearinghouses are classified as Level 1 measurements. For commodity derivative
contracts classified as Level 3, Duke Energy utilizes internally-developed
financial models based upon the income approach (discounted cash flow method)
are utilized to measure the fair values. The primary inputs to these models are
the forward commodity prices used to develop the forward price curves for the
respective instrument. The pricing inputs are derived from published exchange
transaction prices and other observable or public data sources. In the absence
of observable market information that supports the pricing inputs, there is a
presumption that the transaction price is equal to the last observable price
for a similar period. For the commodity derivative contracts classified as
Level 3, the pricing inputs for natural gas and electricity forward price
curves are not observable for the full term of the related contracts. In
isolation, increases (decreases) in unobservable natural gas forward prices
would result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments for gas purchase
contracts. In isolation, increases (decreases) in unobservable electricity
forward prices would result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustments
for electricity sales contracts. Duke Energy regularly evaluates and validates
the pricing inputs used to estimate fair value of gas purchase contracts by a
market participant price verification procedure, which provides a comparison of
internal forward commodity curves to market participant generated curves.  

   Contingent Value
Obligations (CVO).    Progress
Energy issued CVOs, which are derivatives, in connection with the acquisition
of Florida Progress Corporation (Florida Progress). In November 2011, Progress
Energy commenced a public tender offer that expired on February 15, 2012. At
December 31, 2012, and 2011 all CVOs not tendered, have been classified as
Level 2 based on observable prices in the less-than-active market.  

  In connection with the
acquisition of Florida Progress during 2000, the Progress Energy parent issued
98.6 million CVOs. Each CVO represents the right of the holder to receive
contingent payments based on the performance of four coal-based solid synthetic
fuels limited liability companies purchased by subsidiaries of Florida Progress
in October 1999. All of Progress Energy s synthetic fuels businesses were
abandoned and all operations ceased as of December 31, 2007. The payments are
based on the net after-tax cash flows the facilities generated. Progress Energy
makes deposits into a CVO trust for estimated contingent payments due to CVO
holders based on the results of operations and the utilization of tax credits.
The balance of the CVO trust at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was $11 million and
is included in Other within Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Future payments from the trust to CVO holders will not be made
until certain conditions are satisfied and will include principal and interest
earned during the investment period, net of expenses deducted. Interest earned
on the payments held in trust for 2012 and 2011 were insignificant.  

  In October 2011, Progress
Energy entered a settlement agreement and release with a plaintiff under which
the parties mutually released all claims related to the CVOs and Progress
Energy purchased all of the plaintiff s CVOs at a negotiated purchase price of
$0.75 per CVO. In November 2011, Progress Energy also commenced a tender offer
for all remaining outstanding CVOs at the same purchase price. The tender offer
expired on February 15, 2012. Progress Energy repurchased 83.4 million CVOs
through the settlement agreement or through the tender offer. The CVOs are
derivatives and are recorded at fair value. In 2011, pre-tax losses of $59
million from changes in fair value were recorded in Other Income and Expenses,
net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2012, the CVO
liability included in Other within Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $4 million based on the 15.2 million
outstanding CVOs not held by the Progress Energy parent. At December 31, 2011,
the CVO liability included in Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets was $14 million based on the 18.5 million CVOs outstanding not
held by the Progress Energy parent.

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

At
both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the fair value of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, notes
payable and commercial paper and non-recourse notes payable of variable
interest entities are not materially different from their carrying amounts
because of the short-term nature of these instruments and/or because the stated
rates approximate market rates.

    Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities         

The Duke Energy
Registrants classify their investments in debt and equity securities into two
categories   trading and available-for-sale.   

    Trading Securities.         Investments in debt
and equity securities held in grantor trusts associated with certain deferred
compensation plans and certain other investments are classified as trading
securities and are reported at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
with net realized and unrealized gains and losses included in earnings each
period. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the fair value of these
investments was $  33  
million and $32 million, respectively.   

    Available for Sale
Securities.    
All other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale securities, which are also reported at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets with unrealized gains and losses excluded from
earnings and reported either as a regulatory asset or liability, as discussed
further below, or as a component of other comprehensive income until realized.  

  Duke Energy s
available-for-sale securities are primarily comprised of investments held in
the (i) Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund (NDTF) at Duke Energy Carolinas,
Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida, (ii) investments in
grantor trusts at both Duke Energy Indiana and Progress Energy Florida related
to other post-retirement benefit plans as required by the IURC and FPSC,
respectively, (iii) Duke Energy captive insurance investment portfolio, (iv) Duke
Energy s foreign operations investment portfolio and (v) investments of Duke
Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas in auction rate debt securities.   

  The investments within
the NDTF at Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy
Florida and the Duke Energy Indiana and Progress Energy Florida grantor trusts
are managed by independent investment managers with discretion to buy, sell and
invest pursuant to the objectives set forth by the trust agreements. Therefore,
Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress
Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana have limited oversight of the day-to-day
management of these investments. Since day-to-day investment decisions,
including buy and sell decisions, are made by the investment manager, the
ability to hold investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control
of Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress
Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana. Accordingly, all unrealized gains and
losses associated with debt and equity securities within the NDTF at Duke
Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida and the
Duke Energy Indiana and Progress Energy Florida grantor trusts are considered
other-than-temporary and are recognized immediately when the fair value of
individual investments is less than the cost basis of the investment. Pursuant
to regulatory accounting, substantially all unrealized gains and losses
associated with investments in debt and equity securities within the NDTF at Duke
Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida and the
Duke Energy Indiana and Progress Energy Florida grantor trusts are deferred as
a regulatory asset or liability. As a result there is no immediate impact on
the earnings of Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Progress Energy
Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida or Duke Energy Indiana.   

  For investments in
debt and equity securities held in the captive insurance investment portfolio, the
foreign operations investment portfolio and investments in auction rate debt
securities, unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive
income until realized, unless it is determined that the carrying value of an
investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. If so, the write-down to fair
value may be included in earnings based on the criteria discussed below.   

  For available-for-sale
securities outside of the NDTF at Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy
Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida, and the Duke Energy Indiana and Progress
Energy Florida grantor trusts, which are discussed separately above, Duke
Energy analyzes all investment holdings each reporting period to determine
whether a decline in fair value should be considered other-than-temporary.
Criteria used to evaluate whether an impairment associated with equity
securities is other-than-temporary includes, but is not limited to, the length
of time over which the market value has been lower than the cost basis of the
investment, the percentage decline compared to the cost of the investment and
management s intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a
period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market
value. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the
investment is written down to its fair value through a charge to earnings.   

  With respect to
investments in debt securities, under the accounting guidance for
other-than-temporary impairment, if the entity does not have an intent to sell
the security and it is not more likely than not that management will be
required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its cost basis, the
impairment write-down to fair value would be recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income, except for when it is determined that a credit loss
exists. In determining whether a credit loss exists, management considers,
among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value
has been less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the financial condition
of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset backed security, the
financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, consideration of
underlying collateral and guarantees of amounts by government entities, ability
of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments
and any changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies. If it is
determined that a credit loss exists, the amount of impairment write-down to
fair value would be split between the credit loss, which would be recognized in
earnings, and the amount attributable

to all other
factors, which would be recognized in other comprehensive income. Management
believes, based on consideration of the criteria above, that no credit loss
exists as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Management does not
have the intent to sell such investments in auction rate debt securities and
the investments in debt securities within its captive insurance investment
portfolio and foreign operations investment portfolio, and it is not more
likely than not that management will be required to sell these securities
before the anticipated recovery of their cost basis. Management has concluded
that there were no other-than-temporary impairments for debt or equity
securities necessary as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Accordingly,
all changes in the market value of investments other than the NDTF at Duke
Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida and the
Duke Energy Indiana and Progress Energy Florida grantor trusts were reflected
as a component of other comprehensive income in 2012 and 2011.   

  See Note 16 for
additional information related to fair value measurements for investments in
auction rate debt securities.   

    Short-term and
Long-term investments     .     Investments in debt and equity securities are classified
as either short-term investments or long-term investments based on management s
intent and ability to sell these securities, taking into consideration
illiquidity factors in the current markets.   

  Duke Energy holds
corporate debt securities which were purchased using excess cash from its
foreign operations. These investments are classified as Short-term investments
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are available for current operations of
Duke Energy s foreign business. The fair value of these investments was $  333   million as of December
31, 2012 and $190 million as of December 31, 2011.  

  Duke Energy classifies
its investments in debt and equity securities held in the NDTF at Duke Energy
Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Florida, the Duke Energy
Indiana and Progress Energy Florida grantor trusts and the captive insurance investment
portfolio as long-term. Additionally, Duke Energy has classified $29 million
carrying value ($34 million par value) and $71 million carrying value ($89
million par value) of investments in auction rate debt securities as long-term
at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, due to market
illiquidity factors as a result of continued failed auctions, and since
management does not intend to use these investments in current operations. All
of these investments are classified as available-for-sale and, therefore, are
reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at estimated fair value based on
either quoted market prices or management s best estimate of fair value based
on expected future cash flow using appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates.

18. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES   

A VIE is
an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than a simple analysis
of voting control. The analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE
considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, the adequacy
of the equity investment of an entity and the relationship of voting power to
the amount of equity invested in an entity. This analysis is performed either
upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of an event
requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entity s assets or
activities. If an entity is determined to be a VIE, a qualitative analysis of
control determines the party that consolidates a VIE based on what party has
the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE that impact its
economic performance as well as what party has rights to receive benefits or is
obligated to absorb losses that are significant to the VIE. The analysis of the
party that consolidates a VIE is a continual reassessment.   

   Consolidated
VIEs    

  The
table below shows the VIEs that Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas
consolidate and how these entities impact Duke Energy s and Duke Energy
Carolinas  respective Consolidated Balance Sheets. None of these entities are
consolidated by Progress Energy, Progress Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy
Florida, Duke Energy Ohio or Duke Energy Indiana.   

  Other
than the discussion below related to CRC, no financial support was provided to
any of the consolidated VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011,
or is expected to be provided in the future, that was not previously     contractually

DERF.    Duke Energy Carolinas
securitizes certain accounts receivable through DERF, a bankruptcy remote,
special purpose subsidiary. DERF is a wholly owned limited liability company of
Duke Energy Carolinas with a separate legal existence from its parent, and its
assets are not intended to be generally available to creditors of Duke Energy Carolinas.
As a result of the securitization, on a daily basis Duke Energy Carolinas sells
certain accounts receivable, arising from the sale of electricity and/or
related services as part of Duke Energy Carolinas  franchised electric
business, to DERF. In order to fund its purchases of accounts receivable, DERF
has a $300 million secured credit facility with a commercial paper conduit,
which expires in August 2014. Duke Energy Carolinas provides the servicing for
the receivables (collecting and applying the cash to the appropriate
receivables). Duke Energy Carolinas  borrowing under the credit facility is
limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold, which has been and is
expected to be in excess of the amount borrowed, which is maintained at $300
million. The debt is classified as long-term since the facility has an
expiration date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date.   

  The obligations of
DERF under the facility are non-recourse to Duke Energy Carolinas. Duke Energy
and its subsidiaries have no requirement to provide liquidity, purchase assets
of DERF or guarantee performance. DERF is considered a VIE because the equity
capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. If deficiencies in
the net worth of DERF were to occur, those deficiencies would be cured through
funding from Duke Energy Carolinas. In addition, the most significant activity
of DERF relates to the decisions made with respect to the management of
delinquent receivables. Since those decisions are made by Duke Energy Carolinas
and any net worth deficiencies of DERF would be cured through funding from Duke
Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Carolinas consolidates DERF.   

   CRC    .     CRC was formed in
order to secure low cost financing for Duke Energy Ohio, including Duke Energy
Kentucky, and Duke Energy Indiana. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana
sell on a revolving basis at a discount, nearly all of their customer accounts
receivable and related collections to CRC. The receivables which are sold are
selected in order to avoid any significant concentration of credit risk and
exclude delinquent receivables. The receivables sold are securitized by CRC
through a facility managed by two unrelated third parties and the receivables
are used as collateral for commercial paper issued by the unrelated third
parties. These loans provide the cash portion of the proceeds paid by CRC to
Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. The proceeds obtained by Duke Energy
Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana from the sales of receivables are cash and a subordinated
note from CRC (subordinated retained interest in the sold receivables) for a
portion of the purchase price (typically approximates 25 percent of the total
proceeds). The amount borrowed by CRC against these receivables is non-recourse
to the general credit of Duke Energy, and the associated cash collections from
the accounts receivable sold is the sole source of funds to satisfy the related
debt obligation. Borrowing is limited to approximately 75% of the transferred
receivables. Losses on collection in excess of the discount are first absorbed
by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by
Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. The discount on the receivables
reflects interest expense plus an allowance for bad debts net of a servicing
fee charged by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Duke Energy Ohio and
Duke Energy Indiana are responsible for the servicing of the receivables
(collecting and applying the cash to the appropriate receivables). Depending on
the experience with collections, additional equity infusions to CRC may be
required to be made by Duke Energy in order to maintain a minimum equity
balance of $3 million. There were no infusions to CRC during the year
ended December 31, 2012. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, Duke Energy infused $6 million and $10 million of equity to CRC
to remedy net worth deficiencies. The amount borrowed fluctuates based on the
amount of receivables sold. The debt is short term because the facility has an
expiration date of less than one year from the balance sheet date. The current
expiration date is November 2013. CRC is considered a VIE because the equity
capitalization is insufficient to support its

operations,
the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity are not
performed by the equity holder, Cinergy, and deficiencies in the net worth of
CRC are not funded by Cinergy, but by Duke Energy. The most significant
activity of CRC relates to the decisions made with respect to the management of
delinquent receivables. These decisions, as well as the requirement to make up
deficiencies in net worth, are made by Duke Energy and not by Duke Energy Ohio,
Duke Energy Kentucky or Duke Energy Indiana. Thus, Duke Energy consolidates
CRC. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana do not consolidate CRC.   

   CinCap V.    CinCap V was created
to finance and execute a power sale agreement with Central Maine Power Company
for approximately 35 MW of capacity and energy. This agreement expires in 2016.
CinCap V is considered a VIE because the equity capitalization is insufficient
to support its operations. As Duke Energy has the power to direct the most
significant activities of the entity, which are the decisions to hedge and
finance the power sales agreement, CinCap V is consolidated by Duke Energy.   

   Renewables.    Duke Energy s
renewable energy facilities include Green Frontier Windpower, LLC, Top of The
World Wind Energy LLC, Los Vientos Windpower1A LLC, Los Vientos Windpower 1B,
LLC and various solar projects, all subsidiaries of DEGS, an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Duke Energy.   

  Green Frontier
Windpower, LLC, Top of the World Wind Energy, LLC and the various solar
projects are VIEs due to power purchase agreements with terms that approximate
the expected life of the projects. These fixed price agreements effectively
transfer the commodity price risk to the buyer of the power. Duke Energy has
consolidated these entities since inception because the most significant
activities that impact the economic performance of these renewable energy
facilities were the decisions associated with the siting, negotiation of the
purchase power agreement, engineering, procurement and construction, and
decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance related
activities, all of which were made solely by Duke Energy.   

  The debt held by these
renewable energy facilities is non-recourse to the general credit of Duke
Energy. Duke Energy and its subsidiaries have no requirement to provide
liquidity or purchase the assets of these renewable energy facilities. Duke
Energy does not guarantee performance except for the production tax credit
guarantee mentioned above, an immaterial multi-purpose letter of credit and
various immaterial debt service reserve and operations and maintenance reserve
guarantees. The assets are restricted and they cannot be pledged as collateral
or sold to third parties without the prior approval of the debt holders.   

   Other.    Duke Energy has other
VIEs with restricted assets and non-recourse debt. As of December 31, 2011 these
VIEs included certain on-site power generation facilities which were sold in
2012. Duke Energy consolidated these particular on-site power generation
entities because Duke Energy had the power to direct the majority of the most
significant activities, which, most notably involved the oversight of operation
and maintenance related activities that impact the economic performance of
these entities.   

   Non-consolidated VIEs    

  The tables below show
the VIEs that the Duke Energy Registrants do not consolidate and how these
entities impact the Duke Energy Registrants respective Consolidated Balance
Sheets. As discussed above, while Duke Energy consolidated CRC, Duke Energy
Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana do not consolidate CRC as they are not the primary
beneficiary.

No
financial support that was not previously contractually required was provided
to any of the unconsolidated VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2011, respectively, or is expected to be provided in the future.   

  With
the exception of the power purchase agreement with the Ohio Valley Electric
Corporation (OVEC), which is discussed below, and various guarantees, reflected
in the table above as  Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities , the Duke Energy
Registrants are not aware of any situations where the maximum exposure to loss
significantly exceeds the carrying values shown above.   

   DukeNet    .     In 2010, Duke Energy
sold a 50% ownership interest in DukeNet to Alinda. The sale resulted in
DukeNet becoming a joint venture with Duke Energy and Alinda each owning a   50  % interest. In
connection with the formation of the new DukeNet joint venture, a 5-year, $150
million senior secured credit facility was executed with a syndicate of 10
external financial institutions. This credit facility is non-recourse to Duke
Energy. DukeNet is considered a VIE because it has entered into certain
contractual arrangements that provide DukeNet with additional forms of
subordinated financial support. The most significant activities that impact
DukeNet s economic performance relate to its business development and fiber
optic capacity marketing and management activities. The power to direct these
activities is jointly and equally shared by Duke Energy and Alinda. As a
result, Duke Energy does not consolidate the DukeNet. Accordingly, DukeNet is a
non-consolidated VIE that is reported as an equity method investment.   

  Unless consent by Duke
Energy is given otherwise, Duke Energy and its subsidiaries have no requirement
to provide liquidity, purchase the assets of DukeNet, or guarantee performance.

Renewables    .     Duke Energy has
investments in various entities that generate electricity through the use of
renewable energy technology. Some of these entities are VIEs which are not
consolidated due to the joint ownership of the entities when they were created
and the power to direct and control key activities is shared jointly. Instead,
Duke Energy s investment is recorded under the equity method of accounting.
These entities are VIEs due to power purchase agreements with terms that
approximate the expected life of the project. These fixed price agreements
effectively transfer the commodity price risk to the buyer of the power.  

  DS Cornerstone, LLC, a
50/50 joint venture entity with a third-party joint venture partner, owns two
windpower projects and has executed a third party financing against the two
windpower projects.  DS Cornerstone was a consolidated VIE of Duke Energy
through August 31, 2012, as the members equity was not sufficient to support
the operations of the joint venture as demonstrated by the third party
financing.  Duke Energy provided a Production Tax Credit (PTC) Remedy
Agreement to the joint venture partner whereby Duke Energy guaranteed the two
windpower projects would achieve commercial operation in 2012 and an agreed to
number of wind turbines would qualify for production tax credits. In the event
the agreed to number of wind turbines of the two wind generating facilities
failed to qualify, the joint venture partner had the option to put its equity
ownership interest back to Duke Energy. The PTC Remedy Agreement resulted in
greater loss exposure to Duke Energy and, as a result, Duke Energy consolidated
DS Cornerstone, LLC through August 31, 2012, until both projects reached
commercial operation and the appropriate number of wind turbines qualified for
PTC. As of December 31, 2012, DS Cornerstone is a non-consolidated VIE. The
most significant activities that impact DS Cornerstone s economic performance
are the decisions related to the ongoing operations and maintenance activities.
The power to direct these activities is jointly and equally shared by Duke
Energy and Sumitomo. As a result, Duke Energy does not consolidate the DS
Cornerstone. Accordingly, DS Cornerstone is a non-consolidated VIE that is
reported as an equity method investment.   

   FPC Capital I Trust    .    Progress Energy has
variable interests in the FPC Capital I Trust (the Trust) which is a VIE of
which Duke Energy is not the primary beneficiary. The Trust, a finance
subsidiary, was established in 1999 for the sole purpose of issuing $300
million of 7.10% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities due 2039, and
using the proceeds thereof to purchase from Florida Progress Funding Corporation
(Funding Corp.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Progress Energy, $300 million of
7.10% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Notes due 2039. The Trust has no
other operations and its sole assets are the subordinated notes and related
guarantees. Funding Corp. was formed for the sole purpose of providing
financing to Progress Energy Florida and its subsidiaries. Funding Corp. does
not engage in business activities other than such financing and has no
independent operations. Progress Energy has guaranteed the payments of all
distributions required by the trust.   

   Other    .     Duke Energy has
investments in various other entities that are VIEs which are not consolidated.
The most significant of these investments is Duke Energy Ohio s 9% ownership
interest in OVEC. Through its ownership interest in OVEC, Duke Energy Ohio has
a contractual arrangement through June 2040 to buy power from OVEC s power
plants. The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC to its power purchase
agreement counterparties, including Duke Energy Ohio, are designed to be
sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses, fixed costs, debt
amortization and interest expense, as well as earn a return on equity.
Accordingly, the value of this contract is subject to variability due to
fluctuations in power prices and changes in OVEC s costs of business, including
costs associated with its 2,256 megawatts of coal-fired generation capacity. As
discussed in Note 5, the proposed rulemaking on cooling water intake
structures, MATS, CSAPR and CCP s could increase the costs of OVEC which would
be passed through to Duke Energy Ohio. The initial carrying value of this
contract was recorded as an intangible asset when Duke Energy acquired Cinergy
in April 2006.   

  In addition, the
company has guaranteed the performance of certain entities in which the company
no longer has an equity interest. As a result, the company has a variable
interest in certain other VIEs that are non-consolidated.  

   CRC    .     As discussed above,
CRC is consolidated only by Duke Energy. Accordingly, the retained interest in
the sold receivables recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy
Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are eliminated in consolidation at Duke Energy.   

  The
proceeds obtained from the sales of receivables are largely cash but do include
a subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the purchase price (typically
approximates 25% of the total proceeds). The subordinated note is a retained
interest (right to receive a specified portion of cash flows from the sold
assets) and is classified within Receivables in Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke
Energy Indiana s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. The retained interests reflected on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana approximate fair value.   

  The carrying values of the retained interests
are determined by allocating the carrying value of the receivables between the
assets sold and the interests retained based on relative fair value. Because
the receivables generally turnover in less than two months, credit losses are
reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant
concentration, and the purchased beneficial interest (equity in

CRC) is subordinate to all retained interests and thus
would absorb losses first, the allocated basis of the subordinated notes are
not materially different than their face value. The hypothetical effect on the
fair value of the retained interests assuming both a 10% and a 20% unfavorable
variation in credit losses or discount rates is not material due to the short
turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history. Interest
accrues to Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana on the retained interests
using the acceptable yield method, which generally approximates the stated rate
on the notes since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly
equivalent. An impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both
the retained interests and purchased beneficial interest whenever it is determined
that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. The key assumptions used
in estimating the fair value in 2012 and 2011 is detailed in the following
table:   

Cash flows from the
sale of receivables are reflected within Operating Activities on Duke Energy
Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   

  Collection fees
received in connection with the servicing of transferred accounts receivable
are included in Operation, Maintenance and Other on Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke
Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The loss recognized on
the sale of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying the receivables
sold during the month by the required discount which is derived monthly
utilizing a three year weighted average formula that considers charge-off
history, late charge history, and turnover history on the sold receivables, as
well as a component for the time value of money. The discount rate, or
component for the time value of money, is calculated monthly by summing the
prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of 1.00 percent as of December 31,
2012, as compared to prior month-end LIBOR plus 2.39 percent as of December 31,
2011.  

19. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (EPS)    

Basic
Earnings Per Share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income attributable to
Duke Energy common shareholders, adjusted for distributed and undistributed
earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by
dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common shareholders, as
adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating
securities, by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as stock options,
phantom shares and stock-based performance unit awards were exercised or
settled.   

   Duke Energy   

  On
July 2, 2012, just prior to the close of the merger with Progress Energy, Duke
Energy executed a one-for-three reverse stock split. All earnings per share

  Beginning in the
fourth quarter of 2008, Duke Energy began issuing authorized but previously
unissued shares of common stock to fulfill obligations under its Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) and other internal plans, including 401(k) plans.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, Duke Energy received proceeds of
$288 million from the sale of common stock associated with these plans.
Proceeds from the sale of common stock associated with these plans were not
significant in 2012 and 2011. Duke Energy has discontinued issuing new shares
of common stock under the DRIP.

    PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARIES   

All
of Duke Energy s and Progress Energy s preferred stock was issued by Progress
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida to third-party holders prior to
the July 2, 2012 merger with Progress Energy. The preferred stock contains
certain provisions that could require redemption of the preferred stock for
cash. In the event dividends payable on Progress Energy Carolinas  or Progress
Energy Florida s preferred stock are in default for an amount equivalent to or
exceeding four quarterly dividend payments, the holders of the preferred stock
are entitled to elect a majority of Progress Energy Carolinas  or Progress
Energy Florida s respective board of directors until all accrued and unpaid
dividends are paid. All classes of preferred stock are entitled to cumulative
dividends with preference to the common stock dividends, are redeemable by vote
of the Progress Energy Carolinas  or Progress Energy Florida s respective board
of directors at any time, and do not have any preemptive rights. All classes of
preferred stock have a liquidation preference equal to $100 per share plus any
accumulated unpaid dividends except for Progress Energy Florida s 4.75%, $100
par value class, which does not have a liquidation preference. Each holder of Progress
Energy Carolinas  preferred stock is entitled to one vote. The holders of Progress
Energy Florida s preferred stock have no right to vote except for certain
circumstances involving dividends payable on preferred stock that are in
default or certain matters affecting the rights and preferences of the
preferred stock.

On February 6, 2013, notices of redemption
for all series of Progress Energy Carolinas  and Progress Energy Florida s
outstanding preferred stock and serial preferred stock were sent to
shareholders. The preferred stock and serial preferred stock will be redeemed
on March 8, 2013, at the redemption prices listed below plus accrued dividends
using available cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Funds sufficient to pay
the redemption price for each series have been deployed with a bank, acting as
paying agent, with irrevocable instructions to pay the holders at the
respective redemption prices, and, as a result, under North Carolina law and
the Charter of Progress Energy Carolinas, the holders of the preferred stock
have ceased to be stockholders.  

  The
following table shows preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2012 and

21. SEVERANCE    

2011 Severance Plan.    In conjunction with
the merger with Progress Energy, in November 2011 Duke Energy and Progress
Energy offered a voluntary severance plan to certain eligible employees. As
this was a voluntary severance plan, all severance benefits offered under this
plan are considered special termination benefits under U.S. GAAP. Special
termination benefits are measured upon employee acceptance and recorded
immediately absent any significant retention period. If a significant retention
period exists, the cost of the special termination benefits are recorded
ratably over the retention period. Approximately 1,100 employees from Duke
Energy and Progress Energy requested severance during the voluntary window,
which closed on November 30, 2011. The estimated amount of severance payments
associated with this voluntary plan and other severance benefits through 2014,
excluding amounts incurred through December 31, 2012, are expected to range
from $30 million to $60 million and most of the costs will be charged to Duke
Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida.    

  Additionally, in the
third quarter of 2012, a voluntary severance plan was offered to certain unionized
employees of Duke Energy Ohio. Approximately 75 employees accepted the
termination benefits during the voluntary window, which closed on October 8,
2012. The expense associated with this plan was not material.  

  In conjunction with
the retirement of the Crystal River Nuclear Plant Unit 3, severance benefits
will be made available to certain eligible impacted unionized and non-unionized
employees, to the extent that those employees do not find job opportunities at other
locations. Approximately 600 employees work at Crystal River Nuclear Plant Unit
3. Duke Energy is currently determining which employees will be impacted by the
retirement and therefore offered severance benefits. Future severance expense
Duke Energy expects to incur at Progress Energy Florida is currently not
estimable as total number of employees impacted and job classifications and
functions have not yet been determined.  

   2010
Severance Plans.    During
2010, the majority of severance charges were related to a voluntary severance
plan whereby eligible employees were provided a window during which to accept
termination benefits. As this was a voluntary plan, all severance benefits
offered under this plan were also considered special termination benefits under
U.S. GAAP and accorded the same accounting treatment as discussed above.
Approximately 900 employees accepted the termination benefits during the
voluntary window, which closed March 31, 2010.   

  Amounts included in
the table below represent direct and allocated severance and related expense
recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants, and are recorded in Operation,
maintenance, and other within Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The Duke Energy Registrants recorded insignificant amounts for
severance expense during 2011 for past and ongoing severance plans.

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

As part of Duke Energy
Carolinas  2011 rate case, the NCUC approved the recovery of $101 million of
previously recorded expenses related to a prior year Voluntary Opportunity
Plan. This amount was recorded as a reduction to Operation, maintenance, and
other within Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations
and recognized as a Regulatory asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in
2012.  

22. STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION   

For
employee awards, equity classified stock-based compensation cost is measured at
the service inception date or the grant date, based on the estimated
achievement of certain performance metrics or the fair value of the award, and
is recognized as expense or capitalized as a component of property, plant and
equipment over the requisite service period.   

  Duke
Energy s 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan) reserved 25 million
shares of common stock for awards to employees and outside directors. The 2010
Plan supersedes the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2006 Plan),
and no additional grants will be made from the 2006 Plan. Under the 2010 Plan,
the exercise price of each option granted cannot be less than the market price
of Duke Energy s common stock on the date of grant and the maximum option term
is 10 years. The vesting periods range from immediate to three years. Duke
Energy has historically issued new shares upon exercising or vesting of
share-based awards. In 2013, Duke Energy may use a combination of new share issuances
and open market repurchases for share-based awards that are exercised or become
vested; however, Duke Energy has not determined with certainty the amount of
such new share issuances or open market repurchases.  

  The 2010
Plan allows for a maximum of 6.25 million shares of common stock to be issued
under various stock-based awards other than options and stock appreciation
rights.  

  In
connection with the acquisition of Progress Energy in July 2012, Duke Energy
assumed Progress Energy s 1997 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP), which was continued
under the 2002 and 2007 EIPs, as amended and restated from time to time.
Stock-based awards granted under the Progress Energy EIPs and held by Progress
Energy employees were generally converted into outstanding Duke Energy
stock-based compensation awards with the estimated fair value of the awards
allocated to purchase price determined to be $62 million. Refer to Note 2 for
further information regarding the merger transaction.  

   Stock-Based
Compensation Expense

Energy Registrants, net of tax, for stock-based compensation.

Pre-tax
stock-based compensation costs, tax benefit associated with stock-based
compensation expense, and the amount of stock-based compensation costs
capitalized related to the Duke Energy plans are included in the following
table.  

On
December 31, 2011 and 2010, Duke Energy had 1 million and 4 million exercisable
options, respectively, with a weighted-average exercise price of $45 and $51,
respectively. The options granted in 2012 and 2011 were expensed immediately;
therefore, there is no future compensation cost associated with these options.
The following table includes information related to Duke Energy s stock
options.  

The following assumptions were used to determine the grant date
  fair value of the stock options granted in 2012.

(c)  

The expected life of options is derived from the simplified

  six months using the strike price closest to the stock price on the valuation
  date.  

Restricted Stock Unit

The total grant date
fair value of the shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010 was $34 million, $19 million and $29 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2012, Duke Energy had $37 million of unrecognized compensation
cost which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9
years.  

   Performance Awards   

  Stock-based awards
issued and outstanding under the 2010 Plan and the 2006 Plan generally vest
over three years if performance targets are met. Vesting for certain
stock-based performance awards can occur in three years, at the earliest, if
performance is met. Certain performance awards granted in 2012, 2011 and 2010
contain market conditions based on the total shareholder return (TSR) of Duke
Energy stock relative to a pre-defined peer group (relative TSR). These awards
are valued using a path-dependent model that incorporates expected relative TSR
into the fair value determination of Duke Energy s performance-based share
awards. The model uses three-year historical volatilities and correlations for
all companies in the pre-defined peer group, including Duke Energy, to simulate
Duke Energy s relative TSR as of the end of the performance period. For each
simulation, Duke Energy s relative TSR associated with the simulated stock
price at the end of the performance period plus expected dividends within the
period results in a value per share for the award portfolio. The average of
these simulations is the expected portfolio value per share. Actual life to
date results of Duke Energy s relative TSR for each grant is incorporated
within the model. Other performance awards not containing market conditions
were awarded in 2012, 2011 and 2010. The performance goal for the awards is
Duke Energy s return on equity over a three-year period. Awards are measured at
grant date price. The following table includes information related to Duke
Energy s performance awards.   

The total grant date
fair value of the shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010 was $  56  
million, $33 million and $15 million, respectively. At December 31, 2012, Duke
Energy had $25 million of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.  

Progress Energy Plans   

Pre-tax stock-based
compensation expense and tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation
expense related to former Progress Energy plans, including those that were
converted to Duke plans upon the merger, recorded to Progress Energy, Progress
Energy Carolinas, and Progress Energy Florida are included in the following

periods presented.

23. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS   

Defined Benefit
Retirement Plans    

Duke Energy and its
subsidiaries (including legacy Progress Energy and Cinergy businesses)
maintain, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, qualified,
non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S.
employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan
participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are
based upon a percentage (which varies with age and years of service) of current
eligible earnings and current interest credits. Certain legacy Progress Energy
and legacy Cinergy U.S. employees are covered under plans that use a final
average earnings formula. Under the legacy Cinergy final average earnings
formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a
percentage of their highest 3-year average earnings, plus a percentage of their
highest 3-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of
participation (maximum of 35 years), plus a percentage of their highest 3-year
average earnings times years of participation in excess of 35 years. Under the
legacy Progress Energy final average earnings formula, a plan participant
accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest 4-year
average earnings, plus a percentage of their highest 4-year average earnings in
excess of covered compensation per year of participation (maximum of 35 years),
plus a percentage of their highest 4-year average earnings times years of
participation in excess of 35 years. Duke Energy also maintains, and the
Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-qualified, non-contributory defined
benefit retirement plans which cover certain executives.  

  Actuarial gains and
losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average remaining service
period of the active employees. The average remaining service period of active
employees covered by the qualified retirement plans is nine years for Duke
Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana and
eight years for Progress Energy, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy
Florida. The average remaining service period of active employees covered by
the non-qualified retirement plans is thirteen years for Duke Energy and
Progress Energy, nine years for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and
Duke Energy Indiana, twelve years for Progress Energy Carolinas and seventeen
years for Progress Energy Florida . Duke Energy determines the market-related
value of plan assets using a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair
value of the plan assets in a particular year on a straight line basis over the
next five years.   

  Net periodic benefit
costs disclosed in the tables below for the qualified, non-qualified and other
post-retirement benefit plans represent the cost of the respective benefit plan
for the periods presented. However, portions of the net periodic benefit costs
disclosed in the tables below have been capitalized as a component of property,
plant and equipment.   

  Duke Energy uses a
December 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and
obligations.   

  Amounts presented in
the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of
pension and other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for
employees of the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Subsidiary
Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement
benefit cost for employees of Duke Energy s shared services affiliate that
provide support to the Subsidiary Registrants. These allocated amounts are
included in the governance and shared service costs discussed in Note 14.  

  Duke Energy s policy
is to fund amounts on an actuarial basis to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefit payments to be paid to plan participants. The following table includes
information related to the Duke Energy Registrants  contributions to its U.S.
qualified defined benefit pension plans.

(a)  

The assumptions used in 2012 to determine expense reflect
  remeasurement as of July 1, 2012 due to the merger between Duke Energy and
  Progress Energy.  

(b)  

The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used by Progress
  Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida were not materially different
  from the assumptions above, as applicable.  

The discount rate used to determine the current year pension
  obligation and following year s pension expense is based on a bond   

selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops
  a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that
  generate sufficient cash flow to provide for the projected benefit payments
  of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of
  non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond
  portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit
  payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.

The discount rate used in 2012 to determine expense reflects
  remeasurement as of July 1, 2012, due to the merger between Duke Energy and
  Progress Energy.  

(b)  

The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used by Progress
  Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida were not materially different
  from the assumptions above, as applicable.  

The discount rate used to determine the current year pension
  obligation and following year s pension expense is based on a bond   

selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops
  a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that
  generate sufficient cash flow to provide for the projected benefit payments
  of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of
  non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond
  portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the
  present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this
  rate with the market value of the bonds selected.

Other
Post-Retirement Benefit Plans    

Duke
Energy and most of its subsidiaries provide, and the Subsidiary Registrants
participate in, some health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Employees are eligible
for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement,
as defined in the plans. The health care benefits include medical coverage, dental
coverage, and prescription drug coverage and are subject to certain
limitations, such as deductibles and co-payments.   

  These
benefit costs are accrued over an employee s active service period to the date
of full benefits eligibility. The net unrecognized transition obligation is
amortized over 20 years.   

  Actuarial
gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining service period of the
active employees. The average remaining service period of the active employees
covered by the plan is ten years for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke
Energy Indiana, eleven years for Duke Energy Carolinas, nine years for Progress
Energy and Progress Energy Florida and seven years for Progress Energy
Carolinas.   

  Duke
Energy did not make any pre-funding contributions to its other post-retirement
benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.

Duke Energy amounts exclude $9 million, $8 million and $9

  of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting
  adjustments associated with Duke Energy s merger with Cinergy in April 2006.

Duke Energy Ohio amounts exclude $2 million for each of the
  years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of regulatory
  asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated
  with Duke Energy s merger with Cinergy in April 2006.  

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
  Act of 2003 (Modernization Act) introduced a prescription drug   

benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal
  subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. Accounting guidance
  issued and adopted by Duke Energy in 2004 prescribes the appropriate
  accounting for the federal subsidy. The after-tax effect on Duke Energy's net
  periodic post-retirement benefit cost was a decrease of $3 million in 2012,
  $3 million in 2011 and $4 million in 2010. Duke Energy recognized a $1
  million subsidy receivable as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, which is
  included in Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

  presented for Progress Energy Florida and 8.75% in 2010 for Progress Energy
  Carolinas. Progress Energy Florida held no other post-retirement benefit plan
  assets as of December 31, 2012. Progress Energy Carolinas held no other

The discount rate used to determine the current year other

Plan
Assets    

Duke
Energy Master Retirement Trust.    Assets for both the qualified pension and
other post-retirement benefits (excluding Progress Energy plans) are maintained
in a Master Retirement Trust (Duke Energy Master Trust). Approximately 97% of the
Duke Energy Master Trust assets were allocated to qualified pension plans and
approximately 3% were allocated to other post-retirement plans, as of December
31, 2012 and 2011. The investment objective of the Duke Energy Master Trust is
to achieve reasonable returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk,
for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants.   

  The
asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective
and the risk profile. U.S. equities are held for their high expected return.
Non-U.S. equities, debt securities, and real estate are held for
diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be diversified to
achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers
or investments. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and
periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when
considered appropriate.   

  Qualified
pension and other post-retirement benefits for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke
Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are derived from the Duke Energy Master
Trust, as such, each are allocated their proportionate share of the assets
discussed below.   

  The
following table includes the target asset allocations by asset class at December
31, 2012 and the actual asset allocations for the Duke Energy Master Trust.  

Progress Energy Master Trust.    Assets for Progress Energy qualified
pension benefits are maintained in a trust (Progress Energy Master Trust).The
primary objectives of the Progress Energy Master Trust are to ensure sufficient
funds are available at all times to finance promised benefits and to invest the
funds such that contributions are minimized, within acceptable risk limits.
Progress Energy periodically performs studies to analyze various aspects of our
pension plans including asset allocations, expected portfolio return, pension
contributions and net funded status. One key investment objective is to achieve
a rate of return significantly in excess of the discount rate used to measure
the plan liabilities over the long term. Tactical shifts (plus or minus 5
percent) in asset allocation from the target allocations are made based on the
near-term view of the risk and return tradeoffs of the asset classes. Domestic
equity includes investments across large, medium and small capitalized domestic
stocks, using investment managers with value, growth and core-based investment
strategies and includes both long only and long/short equity managers.
International equity includes investments in foreign stocks in both developed
and emerging market countries, using a mix of value and growth-based investment
strategies and includes both long only and long/short equity managers. Domestic
fixed income primarily includes domestic investment grade long duration fixed
income investments.

Qualified
pension benefits for Progress Energy, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress
Energy Florida are derived from the Progress Energy Master Trust. As such, each
are allocated their proportional share of the assets discussed below.

Fair Value
Measurements.    

  The
accounting guidance for fair value defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value in GAAP in the U.S. and expands disclosure
requirements about fair value measurements. Under the accounting guidance for
fair value, fair value is considered to be the exchange price in an orderly
transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a
liability at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses on an exit
price, which is the price that would be received by Duke Energy to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability versus an entry price, which would be the
price paid to acquire an asset or received to assume a liability. Although the
accounting guidance for fair value does not require additional fair value
measurements, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements.   

  Duke
Energy classifies recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements based on
the following fair value hierarchy, as prescribed by the accounting guidance
for fair value, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value into three levels:   

   Level
1     
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
that Duke Energy has the ability to access. An active market for the asset or
liability is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occurs with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information. Duke
Energy does not adjust quoted market prices on Level 1 for any blockage factor.

Level
2      a
fair value measurement utilizing inputs other than a quoted market price that
are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability.
Level 2 inputs include, but are not limited to, quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or
similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other
than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such
as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted
intervals, volatilities, credit risk and default rates. A Level 2 measurement
cannot have more than an insignificant portion of the valuation based on
unobservable inputs.   

   Level
3     
any fair value measurements which include unobservable inputs for the asset or
liability for more than an insignificant portion of the valuation. A Level 3
measurement may be based primarily on Level 2 inputs.

Valuation
methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed above are as follows:   

   Investments
in equity securities.   
Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in
the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter.
Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as
NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading
currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the
principal active market. Duke Energy has not adjusted prices to reflect for
after-hours market activity. Most equity security valuations are Level 1
measures. Investments in equity securities with unpublished prices are valued
as Level 2 if they are redeemable at the measurement date. Investments in
equity securities with redemption restrictions are valued as Level 3.   

   Investments
in corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.    Most debt investments
are valued based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads
applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate)
and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most debt valuations are Level 2
measures. If the market for a particular fixed income security is relatively
inactive or illiquid, the measurement is a Level 3 measurement.   

   Investments
in short-term investment funds.    Investments in short-term investment funds
are valued at the net asset value of units held at year end. Investments in
short-term investment funds with published prices are valued as Level 1.
Investments in short-term investment funds with unpublished prices are valued
as Level 2.   

   Investments
in real estate investment trusts.    Investments in real estate investment trusts
are valued based upon property appraisal reports prepared by independent real
estate appraisers. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of the asset manager is
responsible for assuring that the valuation process provides independent and
reasonable property market value estimates. An external appraisal management
firm not affiliated with the asset manager has been appointed to assist the
Chief Real Estate Appraiser in maintaining and monitoring the independence and
the accuracy of the appraisal process.   

Employee
Savings Plans    

Duke
Energy and Progress Energy sponsor, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate
in, employee savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees. Most
employees participate in a matching contribution formula where Duke Energy
provides a matching contribution generally equal to 100% of employee before-tax
and Roth 401(k) contributions, and, as applicable, after-tax contributions, of
up to 6% of eligible pay per pay period. Dividends on Duke Energy shares held
by the savings plans are charged to retained earnings when declared and shares
held in the plans are considered outstanding in the calculation of basic and
diluted earnings per share.   

  The
following table includes pre-tax employer matching contributions made by Duke
Energy and expensed by the Subsidiary Registrants.  

24. INCOME TAXES   

Duke
Energy and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. with federal
and various state governmental authorities, and in certain foreign
jurisdictions. The taxable income of Duke Energy and its subsidiaries is
reflected in Duke Energy s U.S. federal and state income tax returns. These
subsidiaries have a tax sharing agreement with Duke Energy where the separate
return method is used to allocate tax expenses and benefits to the subsidiaries

The 2006-2007 years are also in Appeals, waiting for the prior cycle to close. The
IRS is currently auditing the federal income tax returns for years 2008 through
2011.   

  Progress
Energy, Progress Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida are no longer
subject to U.S. federal examination for years before 2007. The IRS has examined
years 2007 through 2009 and examination has been completed.  

  With few
exceptions, Duke Energy and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to state,
local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2004.  

25. CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATING STATEMENTS   

Presented below are
the Progress Energy Condensed Consolidating Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows as required
by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. In September 2005, Progress Energy Parent issued
a guarantee of certain payments of two wholly owned indirect subsidiaries, FPC
Capital I and Funding Corp. The guarantees are in addition to the previously
issued guarantees of Progress Energy s wholly owned subsidiary, Florida
Progress.   

  FPC Capital I, a
finance subsidiary, was established in 1999 for the sole purpose of issuing
$300 million of 7.10% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities due
2039, Series A (Preferred Securities), and using the proceeds thereof to
purchase from Funding Corp. $300 million of   7.10  % Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Notes due
2039 (Subordinated Notes). FPC Capital I has no other operations and its sole
assets are the Subordinated Notes and Notes Guarantee (as discussed below).
Funding Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Florida Progress and was formed
for the sole purpose of providing financing to Florida Progress and its
subsidiaries. Funding Corp. does not engage in business activities other than
such financing and has no independent operations. Since 1999, Florida Progress
has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of Funding Corp. under
the Subordinated Notes. In addition, Florida Progress guaranteed the payment of
all distributions related to the Preferred Securities required to be made by FPC
Capital I, but only to the extent that FPC Capital I has funds available for such
distributions (the Preferred Securities Guarantee). The two guarantees
considered together constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Florida
Progress of FPC Capital I s obligations under the Preferred Securities. The
Preferred Securities and the Preferred Securities Guarantee were listed on the
New York Stock Exchange until the February 1, 2013 redemption discussed below.  

  The Subordinated Notes
may be redeemed at the option of Funding Corp. at par value plus accrued
interest through the redemption date. The proceeds of any redemption of the
Subordinated Notes will be used by FPC Capital I to redeem proportional amounts
of the Preferred Securities and common securities in accordance with their
terms. Upon liquidation or dissolution of Funding Corp., holders of the
Preferred Securities would be entitled to the liquidation preference of $25 per
share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of payment. The
annual interest expense related to the Subordinated Notes is reflected in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  

  The Progress Energy
parent has guaranteed the payment of all distributions related to FPC Capital I's
Preferred Securities. At December 31, 2012, FPC Capital I had outstanding   12   million shares of the
Preferred Securities with a liquidation value of $300 million. The Progress
Energy parent s guarantees are joint and several, full and unconditional, and
are in addition to the joint and several, full and unconditional guarantees
previously issued to FPC Capital I and Funding Corp. by Florida Progress. Progress
Energy s subsidiaries have provisions restricting the payment of dividends to
the Progress Energy parent in certain limited circumstances, and as disclosed
in Note 4, there were no restrictions on Progress Energy Carolina s or Progress
Energy Florida s retained earnings.

Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)       

On
January 2, 2013, Funding Corp. provided to the trustee of the Subordinated
Notes notice of its intent to redeem all of the Subordinated Notes on February
1, 2013. The trustee then simultaneously notified the holders of the Preferred
Securities that all of the Preferred Securities would be redeemed on the same
redemption date. These redemptions occurred on February 1, 2013, and,
therefore, the Preferred Securities, the Preferred Securities Guarantee, the
Subordinated Notes, and the Notes Guarantee all ceased to be outstanding or in
effect on February 1, 2013.  

  FPC Capital I is a VIE
of which neither Progress Energy nor Duke Energy is the primary beneficiary.
Separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning FPC Capital I
have not been presented because Progress Energy believes that such information
is not material to investors.   

  In these condensed
consolidating statements, the Progress Energy Parent column includes the
financial results of the parent holding company only. The Subsidiary Guarantor
column includes the consolidated financial results of Florida Progress only,
which is primarily comprised of its wholly owned subsidiary Progress Energy
Florida. The Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries column includes the consolidated
financial results of all non-guarantor subsidiaries, which is primarily
comprised of Progress Energy s wholly owned subsidiary Progress Energy
Carolinas. The Other column includes elimination entries for all intercompany
transactions and other consolidation adjustments. Financial statements for Progress
Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Florida are separately presented elsewhere
in this Form 10-K. All applicable corporate expenses have been allocated appropriately
among the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries. The financial information
may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial
position had the subsidiary guarantor or other non-guarantor subsidiaries
operated as independent entities.

Parent Company Notes to Financial Statements     

1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

Duke
Energy Corporation (Duke Energy) is a holding company that conducts
substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries. As
specified in the merger conditions issued by various state commissions in
connection with Duke Energy s merger with Cinergy Corp. (Cinergy) in April
2006, there are restrictions on Duke Energy s ability to obtain funds from
certain of its subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances. As a
condition to the Duke Energy and Progress Energy merger approval, the NCUC and
the PSCSC imposed conditions (the Progress Merger Conditions) on the ability of
Duke Energy Carolinas, and Progress Energy Carolinas to transfer funds to Duke
Energy through loans or advances, as well as restricted amounts available to
pay dividends to Duke Energy. For further information, see Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters.  Accordingly, these
condensed financial statements have been prepared on a parent-only basis. Under
this parent-only presentation, Duke Energy s investments in its consolidated
subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of accounting. In accordance
with Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X, these parent-only financial statements do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.) for annual financial
statements. Because these parent-only financial statements and notes do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP in the U.S. for
annual financial statements, these parent-only financial statements and other
information included should be read in conjunction with Duke Energy s audited
Consolidated Financial Statements contained within Part II, Item 8 of this
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.   

  Duke Energy and its
subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and
foreign jurisdictional returns as required. The taxable income of Duke Energy s
wholly owned operating subsidiaries is reflected in Duke Energy s U.S. federal
and state income tax returns. Duke Energy has a tax sharing agreement with its
wholly owned operating subsidiaries, where the separate return method is used
to allocate tax expenses and benefits to the wholly owned operating
subsidiaries whose investments or results of operations provide these tax
expenses and benefits. The accounting for income taxes essentially represents
the income taxes that Duke Energy s wholly owned operating subsidiaries would
incur if each were a separate company filing its own tax return as a
C-Corporation.    

2.   DEBT

The
following table summarizes Duke Energy s outstanding debt.  

   Summary of Debt and
Related Terms   

At December 31, 2012,
Duke Energy has guaranteed $734 million of debt issued by Duke Energy
Carolinas, LLC, one of Duke Energy s wholly owned operating subsidiaries.   

  On
November 13, 2012, Duke Energy filed a prospectus supplement to the September
2010 Form S-3 with the SEC, to sell up to $1 billion of fixed or variable rate
unsecured senior notes, called InterNotes, due 1 year to 30 years from the date
of issuance. The InterNotes will be issued as direct, unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations of Duke Energy Corporation. The net proceeds from
the sale of InterNotes will be used to fund capital expenditures in our
unregulated businesses and for general corporate purposes. The balance as of
December 31, 2012 is $36 million, with maturities ranging from 10 to 14 years.
The notes are long-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as
Long-term debt on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  On April
4, 2011, Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $1 billion of
variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form
S-3 states that no more than $500 million of the notes will be outstanding at
any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear
interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy
PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate
payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of
the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, but may be redeemed in
whole or in part by Duke Energy at any time. The notes are non-transferable and
may be redeemed in whole or in part at the investor s option. Proceeds from the
sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes. The balance as
of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, was $395 million and $79 million,
respectively. The notes are a short-term debt obligation of Duke Energy and are
reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy s Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  

  In November 2011, Duke
Energy entered into a $6 billion, five-year master credit facility, expiring in
November 2016, with $4 billion available at closing and the remaining $2
billion became available July 2, 2012, following the closing of the merger with
Progress Energy. In

DUKE

ENERGY CORPORATION   

Schedule I   Condensed

Parent Company Notes to Financial Statements     

October 2012, the Duke Energy
Registrants reached an agreement with banks representing $5.63 billion of
commitments under the master credit facility to extend the expiration date by
one year to November 2017. Through November 2016, the available credit under
this facility remains at $6 billion. The Duke Energy Registrants each have
borrowing capacity under the master credit facility up to specified sublimits
for each borrower. However, Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time
to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a
maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the master credit
facility has been reduced by the use of the master credit facility to backstop
the issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable rate
demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Company at the option of the
holder. Borrowing sublimits are also reduced for certain amounts outstanding
under the money pool arrangement.  

3.       COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES    

Duke Energy and its
subsidiaries are a party to litigation, environmental and other matters. For
further information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Commitments and Contingencies.    

  Duke Energy has
various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications which are
issued in the normal course of business. These contracts include performance
guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and
indemnifications. Duke Energy enters into these arrangements to facilitate
commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the
transaction to the third party. The maximum potential amount of future payments
Duke Energy could have been required to make under these guarantees as of
December 31, 2012 was approximately $6.1 billion. Of this amount, substantially
all relates to guarantees of wholly owned consolidated entities, including debt
issued by Duke Energy Carolinas discussed above, and less than wholly owned
consolidated entities. The majority of these guarantees expire at various times
between 2013 and 2039, with the remaining performance guarantees having no
contractual expiration. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Guarantees and Indemnifications,  for further discussion of guarantees issued
on behalf of unconsolidated affiliates and third parties.   

4.   RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

Duke Energy provides
support to certain subsidiaries for their short-term borrowing needs through
participation in a money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, certain
subsidiaries with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates
participating under this arrangement. Additionally, Duke Energy provides loans
to subsidiaries through the money pool, but is not permitted to borrow funds
through the money pool arrangement. Duke Energy had money pool-related
receivables of $450 million classified as Notes receivable from affiliated companies
on the Condensed Balance Sheets as of both December 31, 2012 and 2011.   

  As of December 31,
2012 and 2011, Duke Energy had an intercompany loan outstanding with Cinergy of
$1,590 million and $608 million, respectively, which is classified within Notes
receivable from affiliated companies on the Condensed Balance Sheets. The $982
million increase in the intercompany loan during 2012 and the $264 million
decrease during 2011 are reflected as Notes receivable from affiliated
companies within Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities on the
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows.   

  In conjunction with
the money pool arrangement and the intercompany loan noted above, Duke Energy
recorded interest income
of approximately $11 million, $4 million and $7 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, which is included in Other Income and Expenses, net on the
Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   

  Duke Energy also
provides funding to and sweeps cash from subsidiaries that do not participate
in the money pool. For these subsidiaries, the cash is used in or generated
from their operations, capital expenditures, debt payments and other
activities. Amounts funded or received are carried as open accounts, as either
Investment in consolidated subsidiaries or as Other deferred credits and other
liabilities, and do not bear interest. These amounts are included within Net
Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities on the Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows.   

  During the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Duke Energy received equity distributions of $450
million, $  299   million and
$350 million, respectively, from Duke Energy Carolinas. These amounts are
reflected within Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities on the
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows.  

  During the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011, Duke Energy paid advances of $16 million and
$15 million, respectively, to Cinergy Corp. for Green Frontier Windpower LLC
PTC funding contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, Duke
Energy forgave a $  29  
million advance to Cinergy Corp.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   DUKE ENERGY, DUKE ENERGY
CAROLINAS, PROGRESS ENERGY, PROGRESS ENERGY CAROLINAS, PROGRESS ENERGY FLORIDA,
DUKE ENERGY OHIO AND DUKE ENERGY INDIANA   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

  Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants
in the reports they file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the
time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) rules
and forms.    

  Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.    

  Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have
evaluated the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2012, and, based upon this evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these
controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of
compliance.  

   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

  Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have
evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred
during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2012 and have concluded no
change has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
internal control over financial reporting.   

   Management s
Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f). The Duke
Energy Registrants  internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and
procedures may deteriorate.  

  The Duke
Energy Registrants  management, including their Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 based
on the framework in    Internal Control   Integrated Framework    issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial
reporting were effective as of December 31, 2012.   

  Deloitte  
Touche LLP, Duke Energy s independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued separate attestation reports on the effectiveness of Duke Energy and
Progress Energy s internal control over financial reporting.

PART III   

To safeguard the
continued independence of the independent auditor, the Duke Energy Audit
Committee adopted a policy that provides that the independent public
accountants are only permitted to provide services to Duke Energy and its
consolidated subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Registrants that have been
pre-approved by the Duke Energy Audit Committee. Pursuant to the policy,
detailed audit services, audit-related services, tax services and certain other
services have been specifically pre-approved up to certain fee limits. In the
event that the cost of any of these services may exceed the pre-approved
limits, the Duke Energy Audit Committee must pre-approve the service. All other
services that are not prohibited pursuant to the Securities and Exchange
Commission s or other applicable regulatory bodies  rules of regulations must
be specifically pre-approved by the Duke Energy Audit Committee. All services
performed in 2012 and 2011 by the independent public accountant were approved
by the Duke Energy Audit Committee and Legacy Progress Energy Audit Committee
pursuant to their pre-approval policies.

 EXCESS PENSION PLAN AMENDMENT

exhibit 10.6.2   

amendment
to the     

    CINeRGY
Corp. excess pension plan    

The
Cinergy Corp. Excess Pension Plan, as amended and restated effective as of
December 31, 2008, as subsequently amended (the  Plan ), is hereby
amended effective as of the close of business on February 2, 2010.  

   (1)                 Explanation of Amendment    

  For purposes of clarity, the Plan is amended
such that the benefit under the Plan will be calculated without regard to the
early retirement provisions applicable to employees who terminate employment
under the redeployment status opportunity provisions of the Cinergy severance
opportunity plan.  

   (2)                 Amendment     

  Section 4.2(b)(ii) of the Plan is amended in
its entirety to read as follows:  

   (ii)            Unrestricted
Benefit  means, for purposes of this Section 4.2, the monthly equivalent
of the benefit to which the Participant would be entitled under the Cinergy
Pension Plan, if that benefit had been determined without regard to the
limitations imposed on qualified retirement plan benefits under Sections 415(b)
and (e) of the Code, and the limitation imposed on qualified retirement plan
compensation under Section 401(a)(17) the Code, except that, notwithstanding
the foregoing:  

  (A)               Nonelective Contributions   . 
To the extent and only to the extent specified by the Committee, any
nonelective employer contributions (other than matching contributions) made on
behalf of a Participant under the Cinergy Corp. 401(k) Excess Plan during any
applicable period shall be taken into account when calculating such
Participant's Unrestricted Benefit.  The Committee from time to time, in its
sole discretion, may designate other amounts that shall be taken into account
when calculating a Participant's Unrestricted Benefit.  

  (B)            Accrued Vacation Pay.  A
Participant's benefit under the Plan shall be calculated by (i) determining the
Participant's Highest Average Earnings under the Cinergy Pension Plan by
including Accrued Vacation Pay in Earnings when paid at the Participant's
termination of employment, and (ii) without taking into account the provision
in the Cinergy Pension Plan that provides that the Participant's Highest
Average Earnings will be determined without regard to Accrued Vacation Pay,
with the resulting amount, increased by the average annual Accrued Vacation
Pay, if any, paid at the Participant's termination of employment.  

  (C)           No Rule of 85 Grow-In.  A
Participant's benefit under the Plan shall be calculated without taking into
account the special early retirement provisions in the Cinergy Pension Plan for
employees who terminate employment under the redeployment status opportunity
provisions of the Cinergy severance opportunity plan (i.e., in particular, the
provision that permits an unreduced early retirement benefit for a Participant
who (i) as of his applicable Severance from Service Date under the Cinergy
Pension Plan had reached age 50, (ii) elected to defer receipt of his pension
under the Cinergy Pension Plan to at least age 55, and (iii) the sum of his age

 EXCESS PENSION PLAN AMENDMENT

EXHIBIT 10.6   

CINERGY
CORP. EXCESS PENSION PLAN   

   (As Amended and Restated Effective December 31, 2008)   

  ARTICLE I 
   PURPOSE OF PLAN   

  The
purpose of the Cinergy Corp. Excess Pension Plan (the  Plan ) is to provide additional
retirement benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees.  The Plan originally was effective as of January 1, 1986 (as the
 PSI Energy, Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan ), was restated and
renamed the  PSI Energy, Inc. Excess Benefit Plan  effective as of
January 1, 1989, was renamed the  Cinergy Corp. Excess Pension Plan 
effective as of January 1, 1997, and was restated effective January 1, 1998,
and has been amended thereafter from time to time.  The Plan is intended to be
a non-qualified, unfunded plan of deferred compensation for a select group of
management or highly compensated employees under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ), and shall be so
interpreted and administered.  Effective December 31, 2008, the Plan is hereby amended
and restated in its entirety, as set forth herein, in order to comply with
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
 Code ).  Concurrent with this amendment and restatement, the benefit
under the Cinergy Corp. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan of the only
individual who, as of December 31, 2008, participates therein and has not yet
commenced payment there under, is hereby transferred to, and shall be provided
under, Article XIII.  

  The
Plan is divided into two separate parts, one of which shall be referred to
herein as  Part I  and the other shall be referred to herein as
 Part II.   Part I, as set forth herein, applies only to participants
who had a Separation from Service before January 1, 2005 and only with respect
to  amounts deferred  in taxable years beginning before January 1,
2005 (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) and any earnings
thereon.  It is intended that such amounts and the earnings thereon shall be
exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code.  Nothing contained
herein is intended to materially enhance a benefit or right existing under Part
I as of October 3, 2004, or add a new material benefit or right to Part I.  As
of January 1, 2005 ( Effective Date ), Part I is frozen, and neither
the Company, its affiliates nor any individual shall make or permit to be made
any additional contributions or deferrals under Part I (other than earnings) on
or after that date.  

  The
portion of the Plan that is not subject to Part I shall be subject to and
governed by the terms and conditions of Part II, as set forth herein, including
(i) any  amounts deferred  in taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2005 (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) and any
earnings thereon and (ii)  amounts deferred  at any time, whether
before or after the Effective Date, for participants who had not had a
Separation from Service before the Effective Date.  To the extent that any of
the amounts described in the preceding sentence were credited or accrued under
the Plan prior to the Effective Date (the  Transferred Amounts ),
then the Committee shall transfer the Transferred Amounts from Part I to Part
II and credit those amounts to the appropriate bookkeeping accounts under Part
II, as selected by the Committee in its sole discretion, or reflect such amount
as an accrual of benefits under Part II.  As a result of such transfer, all of
the Company's obligations and Participant's rights with respect to the
Transferred Amounts under Part I, if any, shall automatically be extinguished
and become obligations and rights under Part II without further action.

   ARTICLE IV 
BENEFITS   

  4.1    General   .     

  (a)               Part I   . 
For purposes of Part I, a Participant's benefit shall be the benefit determined
under the Plan as in effect prior to the Effective Date.  

  (b)               Part II   . 
For purposes of  Part II, the Plan provides: (i) a Traditional Program Benefit
described in Section 4.2 for each Participant who participates under the
Traditional Program, (ii) a Part A Benefit described in Section 4.3 for each
Participant who is treated as a  Choice Participant  under the Cinergy Pension
Plan (   e.g.   , he elected to start participating in the Cash Balance
Program effective on April 1, 2007, or commenced participating therein on a
later applicable rehire or transfer date), (iii) a Cash Balance Make-Whole
Account described in Section 4.4 for each Participant who participates in the
Cash Balance Program, (iv) a Supplemental Account for each Participant

4.2               Traditional Program Benefit   .   

  (a)              General
Rule   .           This Section 4.2 shall apply to each Participant eligible
for a Traditional Program Benefit.  Upon a Participant's Separation from
Service, the Participant will be entitled to a monthly benefit under the Plan
that is equal to the excess, if any, of his Unrestricted Benefit over his
Maximum Benefit, as defined below.  The benefit under the Plan will be
calculated after the Participant's benefits payable under the Cinergy Pension
Plan are calculated (as of the date benefits under the Plan are to commence).  

  (b)              Definitions   . 

(i)            Maximum
Benefit  means, for purposes of this Section 4.2, the monthly equivalent
of the benefit to which the Participant is entitled under the Cinergy Pension
Plan after applying Sections 415(b) and (e) of the Code and Section 401(a)(17)
of the Code.  

  (ii)            Unrestricted
Benefit  means, for purposes of this Section 4.2, the monthly equivalent
of the benefit to which the Participant would be entitled under the Cinergy
Pension Plan, if that benefit had been determined without regard to the limitations
imposed on qualified retirement plan benefits under Sections 415(b) and (e) of
the Code, and the limitation imposed on qualified retirement plan compensation
under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
but only to the extent specified by the Committee, any nonelective employer
contributions (other than matching contributions) made on behalf of a
Participant under the Cinergy Corp. 401(k) Excess Plan during any applicable
period shall be taken into account when calculating such Participant's
Unrestricted Benefit.  The Committee from time to time, in its sole discretion,
may designate other amounts that shall be taken into account when calculating a
Participant's Unrestricted Benefit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant's
benefit under the Plan shall be calculated without taking into account the
provision in the Cinergy Pension Plan which provides that, in the event the
Participant's highest average annual Earnings (as defined in the Cinergy
Pension Plan) occurs other than during his last 36 months of Participation (as
defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan), the Participant's Highest Average
Earnings (as defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan) shall be calculated as if the
Accrued Vacation Pay (as defined in Cinergy s Pension Plan), if any, that was
received by the Participant was received during the last month that occurs
during the period that is used for purposes of determining the Participant's
Highest Average Earnings (as defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan).  

  4.3
             Part A Benefit   .  Each eligible Participant s Part A Benefit
shall be determined in the same manner as a Traditional Program Benefit, but
only with respect to the eligible Participant's Part A   Prior Benefit under
Article 28 of the Cinergy Pension Plan.  

  4.4
             Pay Credits to the Cash Balance Make-Whole Account   .  With
respect to any month after January 1, 2009 that a Participant is eligible for a
Cash Balance Make-Whole Pay Credit under the Plan, the Participant's Cash
Balance Make-Whole Account shall receive a Cash Balance Make-Whole Pay Credit
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the pay credit that would have been
provided under the Cinergy Pension Plan for the month if the Cinergy Pension
Plan used the definition of Compensation set forth herein and, to the extent
determined by the Committee from time to time, other types of excluded pay were
treated as eligible compensation under such Plan, over (b) the pay credit for
the month that is actually made to the Participant's account under the Cinergy
Pension Plan.  A Participant, while Disabled (as defined in the Cinergy Pension
Plan) and continuing to receive pay credits to the Participant's account under
the Cinergy Pension Plan, shall continue to receive Cash Balance Make-Whole Pay
Credits to the Participant's Cash Balance Make-Whole Account determined on the
same basis as his continued pay credits under the Cinergy Pension Plan, and
based upon his eligible Compensation.  In addition, each eligible Participant
shall receive a Cash Balance Make-Whole Pay Credit to the Participant's Cash
Balance Make-Whole Account equal to any reduction in a benefit under the
Cinergy Pension Plan resulting from the limitations imposed by Section 415 of
the Code.  Where an account balance under the Cinergy Pension Plan has been
established for a Participant prior to January 1, 2009, the Committee shall
establish an opening balance for the Participant's Cash Balance Make-Whole
Account that is designed to provide a benefit under the Plan comparable to the
additional benefit that would have been provided under the Plan through the
Cash Balance Program provisions of the Cinergy Pension Plan through December
31, 2008, had the benefit been determined without regard to the limitations
imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) or 415 of the Code.  

  4.5
           Supplemental Credits   .  A Participant's Supplemental Account
shall receive Supplemental Credits, in such amounts and at such times, as the
Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine (including a Supplemental
Credit in such amount and such times, as the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may determine corresponding to the elimination of the Cinergy Corp. Executive
Life Insurance Program).  

  4.6
            Interest Credits   .  An Interest Credit will be added to a
Participant's Cash Balance Make-Whole Account and to a Participant's
Supplemental Account as of the end of each calendar month ending prior to the
month in which the respective account is fully distributed or forfeited.  The
amount of the Interest Credit for a month will equal the balance of the
respective account as of the end of the prior month (after adding any Cash
Balance Make-Whole Pay Credit, Supplemental Credit and Interest Credit for the
prior month and subtracting any payment or forfeiture for the prior month)
multiplied by the Interest Factor for the month.  

  4.7
            Cinergy Transition Benefit   .  For those Participants who were
hired prior to 2003 and elected to move from the Traditional Program to the
Investor Program or Balanced Program (as defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan)
on January 1, 2003 (or later applicable rehire or transfer date), the Cinergy
Pension Plan provides a special rule that the Annual Pension (as defined in the
Cinergy Pension Plan) shall be no less than the sum of the Participant's Prior
Conversion Pension (as defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan) and the Annual
Pension (as defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan) if the Participant had no
accrued benefit other than his Cash Balance Account (as defined in the Cinergy
Pension Plan) and had no amount credited to the Cash Balance Account (as
defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan) as an opening balance.  If, upon
Separation from Service, the special rule described in the immediately
preceding sentence is applicable to the Participant under the Cinergy Pension
Plan, determined as if the Participant elected to receive his benefit under the
Cinergy Pension Plan in the form of a single life annuity upon his Separation
from Service, the Participant shall receive from the Plan upon his Separation
from Service, the Actuarial Equivalent (as defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan)
present value (   i.e.   , single lump sum) of the additional benefit (if any)
that would have been provided through the special rule under the Cinergy
Pension Plan, had the benefit under the special rule been determined without
regard to the limitations imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) or 415 of the Code,
which single lump sum shall be paid within 60 days after his Separation from
Service, or such later date required by Section 6.5.  

4.8             Special Rule for Payments Under the Commercial
Business Unit Annual Incentive Plan   .  Effective with respect to amounts
received on or after January 1, 2004, notwithstanding any other provision of
the Plan, for purposes of calculating the benefit under the Plan (including the
Maximum Benefit and Unrestricted Benefit) of any Participant who   is a participant in
the Energy Merchant Business Unit Annual Incentive Plan, which is also known as
the Cinergy Corp. Commercial Business Unit Annual Incentive Plan, Duke Energy
Generation Services (DEGS) Annual Short-Term Incentive (STI) Discretionary Pool
Plan, Commercial Asset Management (CAM) Discretionary Pool Plan, Regulated
Portfolio Optimization   Fuels Discretionary Incentive Pool Plan, and
Wholesale Origination and Structuring Discretionary Incentive Pool Plan, or any
successor plan (collectively a  Commercial Unit Plan ),   the amount of the Annual Performance Cash Award (as defined
in the Cinergy Pension Plan) that is to be taken into account for a Plan Year
shall not exceed the Participant's rate of annual Base Salary or Base Wage (as
those terms are defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan), as applicable, as of the
last day of the performance period for which the Annual Performance Cash Award
(as defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan) is calculated.  For purposes of
clarity, any amount payable under the Commercial Unit Plan or any other annual
incentive plan maintained by the Commercial Business Unit that is automatically
deferred until a subsequent Plan Year shall not be considered as part of the
Participant's Annual Performance Cash Award (as defined in the Cinergy Pension
Plan).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations contained in this
Section 4.2(b) shall not apply to amounts payable under the Cinergy Corp. Annual
Incentive Plan or the Duke Energy Corporation Annual Incentive Plan.  

   ARTICLE V 
VESTING   

  5.1         
   General Rule   .  Unless the Committee provides otherwise for a particular
Participant at the time the Participant initially becomes eligible to
participate in the Plan or at the time of an award of a particular Supplemental
Credit (and any Interest Credits thereto), a Participant will become fully
vested in the Participant's Traditional Program Benefit, Part A Benefit, Cash
Balance Make-Whole Account, Supplemental Account, and Cinergy Transition
Benefit, if and as applicable, when the Participant becomes vested under the
Cinergy Pension Plan.  If a Participant's employment with the Company
terminates and the Participant is not fully vested, the unvested portion of the
Participant's benefit shall be immediately forfeited and no benefit under the
Plan shall be paid with respect thereto.  

  5.2         
   Change in Control   .  In the event of a Change in Control, all Participant
benefits under the Plan shall become fully and immediately vested and
non-forfeitable and shall thereafter be maintained and paid in accordance with
the terms of the Plan.  

   ARTICLE VI

  6.1             Timing of Payments   .   

  (a)              Part I   . 
For purposes of Part I, the payment of a Participant's benefit under the Plan
will begin as of the same date his benefits under the Cinergy Pension Plan
begin.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Actuarial Equivalent present
value of a Participant's Part I benefit payable under the Plan does not exceed
$5,000, the Committee or its designee will pay the excess in a single lump sum
equal to the Actuarial Equivalent (as defined in the Cinergy Pension Plan) of
the benefit otherwise payable.  

  (b)              Part II   . 
For purposes of Part II, and subject to Section 6.5, a Participant who incurs a
Separation from Service on or after December 31, 2008 will receive, or will
begin to receive, payment of his vested Traditional Program Benefit, Part A
Benefit, Cash Balance Make-Whole Account, Supplemental Account, and Cinergy
Transition Benefit, if and as applicable, as of the first day of the month
following the commencement date elected by the Participant, and if the
Participant was not provided with the opportunity to make such an election or
did not effectively make such an election, in accordance with the default
timing rules specified on    Exhibit A   .   

  6.2          
   Election of Form of Benefit   .  At such time as benefits under the Plan
become payable with respect to a Participant, such benefits shall be paid in
accordance with the benefit payment form then in effect unless otherwise
expressly provided by the Plan.  

  (a)              Part I   . 
For purposes of Part I, the payment of a Participant's benefit under the Plan
will be paid in the same form in which the Participant elects to receive his
pension under the Cinergy Pension Plan.  

  (b)              Part II   . 

(i)              Participant
Elections   .  With respect to Part II, no later than December 31, 2008 (or
such earlier date set by the Committee), each Employee who was then a
Participant was provided an election from among the forms of benefit described
in Section 6.2(c) and on    Exhibit A    regarding the manner
in which such Participant's vested Traditional Program Benefit, Part A Benefit,
Cash Balance Make-Whole Account, and Supplemental Account (but only if such
Participant then-participated in the Cash Balance Program), if and as
applicable, shall be paid.  The election
described in this Section 6.2(b) shall be subject to such terms and conditions
as the Committee may specify in its sole discretion and shall be consistent
with the terms of Notice 2007-86 and the applicable proposed and final Treasury
Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code.  

  (ii)              Default
Rules   .     

  (A)              General   . 
To the extent that a Participant was not provided with the opportunity to make
an election or did not effectively make such an election, his vested
Traditional Program Benefit, Part A Benefit, Cash Balance Make-Whole Account
and Supplemental Account, if and as applicable, shall be paid in accordance
with default rules specified on    Exhibit A   .   

  (B)              Cash
Balance Make-Whole Account   .  For purposes of clarity, to the extent that a
Participant does not designate the form of payment for his vested Cash Balance
Make-Whole Account, and with respect to a Participant who      

first
becomes eligible to participate in the Plan after 2008, such Participant s Cash
Balance Make-Whole Account, if and as applicable, shall be paid in a single
lump sum, notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, or
any other plan, policy, practice or program, contract or agreement with the
Company or the Affiliated Group (unless otherwise specifically provided therein
in a specific reference to the Plan).  

  (C)              Supplemental
Account   .  For purposes of clarity, each Participant s Supplemental Account,
if any, shall be paid: (A) in the same form as his Cash Balance Make-Whole
Account, if any, and (B) in the form of a single lump sum if he does not have a
Cash Balance Make-Whole Account.  

  (iii)             Benefits
that Commence Prior to 2009   .  Benefits that commence to be paid to a
Participant prior to 2009 shall continue to be paid after 2008, in accordance
with the form of benefit elected, until fully paid out.  If a Participant has a
Separation from Service prior to 2009 and elects to commence the payment of his
benefit under the Cinergy Pension Plan prior to 2009, such election shall
govern the payment of his benefit under the Plan, which shall be paid at the
same time and in the same form as his benefit under the Cinergy Pension Plan.   

  (c)                Available
Forms of Benefit   Part II   .  Except as otherwise provided on    Exhibit A   ,
the following forms of benefit are available under Part II.  

  (i)                  Cash
Balance Make-Whole Account and Supplemental Account   .  With respect to each
Participant who is provided with an election, the following forms of benefit
are available for the Participant s Cash Balance Make-Whole Account and
Supplemental Account:  (A) a single lump sum payment, (B) monthly payments for
two to ten years, and (B) monthly payments for fifteen years.  In the event of
monthly installment payments, the amount of the payment for a particular month
shall be calculated as follows.  The monthly amount shall equal  V  divided by
 N,   where  N  represents the number of months remaining in the payment term
and  V  represents the sum of the balance of the Participant's Cash Balance
Make-Whole Account and the balance of the Participant's Supplemental Account,
if any, determined as of the end of the prior month after adding any Cash
Balance Make-Whole Pay Credits, Supplemental Credits and Interest Credits for
the prior month and subtracting any payment or forfeiture for the prior month.  

  (ii)               Traditional
Program   .  With respect to each Participant who is provided with an
election, the following forms of benefit are available for the Participant s
Traditional Program Benefit, each of which shall be determined pursuant to the
payment provisions of the Cinergy Pension Plan.

Life Annuity   .  Provides the Participant with   monthly payments for life.  All benefit
payments stop upon the Participant s death.  

  (B)             
   100%
Contingent Annuitant Option   .  Provides the Participant with monthly payments for life,
and, if he dies before his Beneficiary, with 100% of the monthly amount
continuing after his death to his Beneficiary for the remainder of the
Beneficiary s lifetime.  If the Beneficiary dies before the Participant and the
Participant commenced his benefit on or after age 50, the Participant s benefit
will increase to the amount of the Single Life Annuity on the first of the
month after the Company is notified of the Beneficiary's death.  

  (C)            
   66-2/3%
Contingent Annuitant Option   .  Provides monthly payments for the Participant s life,
and, if he dies before his Beneficiary, with 66-2/3% of the monthly amount
continuing after his death to his Beneficiary for the remainder of his
Beneficiary s lifetime.  If his Beneficiary dies before him, the Participant s
benefit will increase to the amount of the Single Life Annuity on the first of
the month after the Company is notified of the Beneficiary's death.  

  (D)            
   50%
Contingent Annuitant Option   .  Provides monthly payments for the Participant s life,
and, if he dies before his Beneficiary, with 50% of the monthly amount
continuing after his death to his Beneficiary for the remainder of his
Beneficiary s lifetime.  If his Beneficiary dies before him and he commenced
his benefit on or after age 50, his benefit will increase to the amount of the
Single Life Annuity on the first of the month after the Company is notified of
the Beneficiary's death.    

  (E)              Ten-Year Certain and
Life Option   . 
Provides the Participant with a monthly amount payable during his lifetime.  If
his death occurs before he receives payments for ten years, the person he names
as Beneficiary (or his Beneficiary's estate) receives payments for the
remainder of the original ten-year period.  If the Participant dies after he
receives ten years of payments, no further benefits are payable to any
Beneficiary.  The Participant s benefit under this option does not increase to
the Single Life Annuity if his Beneficiary dies before him.    

  (iii)               Part A
Benefit   .  With respect to each Participant who is provided with an
election, the same forms of benefit are available for the Participant s Part A
Benefit as are described above in Section 6.2(c)(ii), except as described
below.  

  (A)            If the
Participant becomes entitled to a Part A Benefit under the Plan after 2007, his
Part A Benefit will be payable only in the form of a single lump sum.

Participant commences the payment of his Part A Benefit prior to his attainment
of age 50, he shall not be entitled to receive his Part A Benefit in the form
of a 66  -2/3%
Contingent Annuitant Option or a Ten-Year Certain and Life Option.  

(d)           
   Special Rule for Supplemental Account   .  Notwithstanding any other
provision of the Plan, and subject to the restrictions of Section 409A of the
Code, prior to making a Supplemental Credit, the Committee may provide that the
portion of the Participant s vested Supplemental Account that is attributable
to such Supplemental Credit shall be distributed in any benefit payment form specified
in advance by the Committee.  

  6.3              Payments in Cash   .  Any
benefit payment due under the Plan shall be paid in cash.  

  6.4              Financial Hardship   . 
Upon written request by a Participant, the Committee may distribute to a
Participant who is receiving a monthly payment form of distribution under Part
II,       such amount of the remaining balance of the Participant's vested
Cash Balance Make-Whole Account and vested Supplemental Account, if any, which
the Committee determines is necessary to provide for a financial hardship
suffered by the Participant.  The term  financial hardship  shall
mean an  unforeseeable emergency  as defined under Section 409A of
the Code.  Payment shall be made within 60 days following the determination
that a withdrawal shall be permitted under this Section, or such later date as
may be required under Section 6.5.  

  6.5              Mandatory Six-Month Delay
Under Part II   .     

  (a)               Lump Sum
or Installments   .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.6(a) and (b),
and to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, with respect to any
Participant who is a Specified Employee as of his or her Separation from
Service, the payment of benefits in the form of a single lump sum or
installments under Part II that are otherwise payable pursuant to the
Participant s Separation from Service shall commence within 60 days after the
first business day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service
(or if earlier, upon the Participant's death).  

  (b)               Annuity
Payments   .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.6(a) and (b), and to
the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, with respect to any
Participant who is a Specified Employee as of his or her Separation from
Service, all annuity payments payable under Part II that are otherwise payable
pursuant to, and during the six-month period commencing upon, the Participant s
Separation from Service, shall be accumulated (along with interest determined
utilizing the Interest Factor) and shall be paid within 60 days after the first
business day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service (or if
earlier, upon the Participant's death).  

  6.6               Discretionary Acceleration
of Payment   .  To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time or schedule of a
payment of benefits under Part II as provided in this Section.  The provisions
of this Section are intended to comply with the exception to accelerated
payments under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j) and shall be interpreted
and administered accordingly.  Except as otherwise specifically provided in
Part II, the Committee may not accelerate the time or schedule of any payment
or amount scheduled to be paid under the Plan within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code.  

  (a)               Domestic
Relations Order   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the
time or schedule of a payment under Part II to an individual other than the
Participant as may be necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order (as
defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code).  

  (b)               Employment
Taxes   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the
acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment under Part II to pay the
Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Sections 3101,
3121(a), and 3121(v)(2) of the Code, or the Railroad Retirement Act (RRTA) tax
imposed under Sections 3201, 3211, 3231(e)(1), and 3231(e)(8) of the Code,
where applicable, on compensation deferred under the Plan (the FICA or RRTA
amount).  Additionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for
the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment, to pay the income tax at
source on wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code or the corresponding
withholding provisions of applicable state, local, or foreign tax laws as a
result of the payment of the FICA or RRTA amount, and to pay the additional
income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding Section 3401 of
the Code wages and taxes.  However, the total payment under this acceleration
provision must not exceed the aggregate of the FICA or RRTA amount, and the
income tax withholding related to such FICA or RRTA amount.  

  (c)                Payment
Upon Income Inclusion Under Section 409A   .  Subject to Section 6.5 hereof,
the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the acceleration of the
time or schedule of a payment under Part II at any time the Plan fails to meet
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  The payment may not exceed the
amount required to be included in income as a result of the failure to comply
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  

  (d)                Payment
of State, Local, or Foreign Taxes   .  Subject to Section 6.5 hereof, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the acceleration of the time
or schedule of a payment under Part II to reflect payment of state, local, or
foreign tax obligations arising from participation in the Plan that apply to an
amount deferred under Part II before the amount is paid or made available to
the Participant (the state, local, or foreign tax amount).  Such payment may
not exceed the amount of such taxes due as a result of participation in the
Plan.  The payment may be made in the form of withholding pursuant to
provisions of applicable state, local, or foreign law or by payment directly to
the participant.  Additionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment under Part II
to pay the income tax at source on wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code
as a result of such payment and to pay the additional income tax at source on
wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code attributable to such additional
wages and taxes.  However, the total payment under this acceleration provision
must not exceed the aggregate of the state, local, and foreign tax amount, and
the income tax withholding related to such state, local, and foreign tax
amount.  

  (e)              Certain
Offsets   .  Subject to Section 6.5 hereof, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment
under Part II as satisfaction of a debt of the Participant to the Company (or
any entity which would be considered to be a single employer with the Company
under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the Code), where such debt is
incurred in the ordinary course of the service relationship between the Company
(or any entity which would be considered to be a single employer with the      

Company under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the
Code) and the Participant, the entire amount of reduction in any of the taxable
years of the Company (or any entity which would be considered to be a single
employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the Code)
does not exceed $5,000, and the reduction is made at the same time and in the
same amount as the debt otherwise would have been due and collected from the
Participant.  

  (f)            Bona Fide
Disputes as to a Right to a Payment   .  Subject to Section 6.5 hereof, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the acceleration of the time
or schedule of a payment under Part II where such payments occur as part of a
settlement between the Participant and the Company (or any entity which would
be considered to be a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or
Section 414(c) of the Code) of an arm's length, bona fide dispute as to the
Participant's right to the deferred amount.  

  (g)               Other Events
and Conditions   .  Subject to Section 6.5 hereof, a payment may be
accelerated upon such other events and conditions as the Internal Revenue
Service may prescribe in generally applicable guidance published in the
Internal Revenue Bulletin.  

  6.7              Delay of Payments   .  To
the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may, in its
sole discretion, delay payment of benefits under Part II under any of the
following circumstances, provided that the Committee treats all payments to similarly
situated Participants on a reasonably consistent basis:  

  (a)              Payments
Subject to Section 162(m)   .  A payment may be delayed to the extent that the
Committee reasonably anticipates that if the payment were made as scheduled,
the Company's deduction with respect to such payment would not be permitted due
to the application of Section 162(m) of the Code.  If a payment is delayed
pursuant to this Section, then the payment must be made either (i) during the
Company's first taxable year in which the Committee reasonably anticipates, or
should reasonably anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the
deduction of such payment will not be barred by application of Section 162(m)
of the Code, or (ii) during the period beginning with the first business day of
the seventh month following the Participant's Separation from Service (the
 six month anniversary ) and ending on the later of (x) the last day
of the taxable year of the Company in which the six month anniversary occurs or
(y) the 15th day of the third month following the six month anniversary.  Where
any scheduled payment to a specific Participant in a Company's taxable year is
delayed in accordance with this paragraph, all scheduled payments to that
Participant that could be delayed in accordance with this paragraph must also
be delayed.  The Committee may not provide the Participant an election with
respect to the timing of the payment under this Section.  For purposes of this
Section, the term Company includes any entity which would be considered to be a
single employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the
Code.  

  (b)              Federal
Securities Laws or Other Applicable Laws   .  A payment may be delayed where
the Committee reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will
violate federal securities laws or other applicable law; provided that the
delayed payment is made at the earliest date at which the Committee reasonably
anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause such violation.  For purposes
of the preceding sentence, the making of a payment that would cause inclusion
in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision
of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable law.  

  (c)              Other
Events and Conditions   .  A payment may be delayed upon such other events and
conditions as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in generally
applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.  

  6.8              Actual
Date of Payment   .  If calculation of the amount of the payment under Part II
is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the
Participant (or Beneficiary), the payment will be treated as made upon the date
specified under Part II if the payment is made during the first calendar year
in which the calculation of the amount of the payment is administratively
practicable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment must be made no later than
the latest possible date permitted under Section 409A of the Code.  Moreover,
notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary except Section
6.5, and to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, a payment will be
treated as made upon the date specified under Part II if the payment is made as
close as administratively practicable to the relevant payment date specified
herein, and in any event within the same calendar year.  

   ARTICLE VII 
DEATH BENEFITS   

  7.1              General
Rule   .  For purposes of Part I, death benefits shall be provided in
accordance with the Plan in effect prior to the Effective Date.  For purposes
of Part II, the Plan provides the following death benefits:  (i) Traditional
Program death benefits described in Section 7.2 for each Participant who
participates under the Traditional Program, (ii) Part A death benefits
described in Section 7.3 for each Participant who has a Part A Benefit, and
(iii) death benefits as described in Section 7.4 for each Participant who has a
Cash Balance Make-Whole Account or Supplemental Account.  

  7.2          
   Traditional Program Death Benefit   .  Upon the death of a Participant
under the Traditional Program of the Cinergy Pension Plan, if his Spouse is
entitled to receive a Spouse's benefit under the Cinergy Pension Plan, his
Spouse will be entitled to receive an annual benefit under the Plan that is
equal to the amount the Participant would have received under the Plan.  Any
excess pension benefits payable under this Section 7.2 to a Spouse will be
payable in equal monthly installments, each installment being equal to 1/12th of
the annual amount as determined pursuant to this Section 7.2.  If at the date
of his death a Participant had reached age 50, the first monthly installment
will be payable to the Participant's Spouse on the first day of the calendar
month coincident with or following the date of the Participant's death, if his
Spouse is then living.  If at the date of his death the Participant had not
reached age 50, the first monthly installment will be payable to the
Participant's Spouse on the first day of the calendar month coincident with or
following the date the Participant would have reached age 50, had he survived
until that date if his Spouse is then living.  In either event, subsequent
monthly installments will be payable on the first day of each month and will cease
upon the payment of the installment due on the first day of the calendar month
in which the Spouse dies.  For purposes of this Section 7.2,  Spouse 
means, with respect to any Participant, the Participant's lawfully married
Spouse, if any, on the applicable date.  The Plan will not recognize common law
arrangements or similar arrangements unless required to do so by federal law.  

7.3               Part A Death Benefit   .  The Part A Benefit
for a Participant's Spouse (as defined in Section 7.2) in the event of the
Participant s death shall be determined in the same manner as the Traditional
Program death benefit in Section 7.2, but only with respect to the
Participant's Part A Benefit.  

  7.4          
   Cash Balance Make-Whole Account and Supplemental Account Death Benefit   . 
Upon a Participant's death, any remaining balance of a Participant's vested
Cash Balance Make-Whole Account and vested Supplemental Account shall be paid
to the Participant's Beneficiary as a death benefit.  The Committee will
provide each Participant with a form to be completed and filed with the
Committee whereby the Participant may designate a Beneficiary.  If the
Participant does not designate a Beneficiary, or if the Beneficiary who is
designated should predecease the Participant, the death benefit for a deceased
Participant shall be paid to the estate of the Participant, as the
Participant's Beneficiary.  If a Participant should die before payment of any
Plan benefits has commenced, payments of any death benefit shall be made to the
Participant's Beneficiary within 90 days after Separation from Service in the
same benefit payment form elected by the Participant, or otherwise required,
under Section 6.2.  If a Participant should die after payment of Plan benefits
has commenced, payment of any death benefit will be made to the Participant's
Beneficiary as a continuation of the benefit payment form that had been in
effect for the Participant.  

   ARTICLE VIII 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

  Cinergy
retains the sole and unilateral right to terminate, amend, modify or supplement
the Plan, in whole or in part, at anytime.  Amendment shall be through action
of the Board of Directors or the Committee.  The Board of Directors or
Committee may delegate its respective right to amend the Plan, subject to any
limitations it may impose, to an officer of the Company.  No such action shall
adversely affect a Participant's right to receive benefits earned prior to the
date of such amendment.  With respect to Part II, subject to Section 6.5
hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion to the extent permitted in
Section 409A of the Code, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule
of a payment under the Plan upon the termination of the Plan.  In the event of
a Change in Control, the Plan shall become irrevocable and may not be amended
or terminated without the written consent of each Plan Participant who may be
affected in any way by such amendment or termination either at the time of such
action or at any time thereafter.  This restriction in the event of a Change in
Control shall be determined by reference to the date any amendment or
resolution terminating the Plan is actually signed by an authorized party
rather than the date such action purports to be effective.  

   ARTICLE IX 
ADMINISTRATION   

  9.1
             Top Hat Plan   .  The Company intends for the Plan to be an
unfunded  top-hat  plan for a select group of management or highly
compensated employees which is exempt from substantially all of the
requirements of Title I of ERISA pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and
401(a)(1) of ERISA.  The Company is the Plan sponsor under Section 3(16)(B) of
ERISA.  

  9.2
              Plan Administrator   .  The Committee shall have the authority
to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Plan document.  The Committee may designate
other persons to carry out fiduciary responsibilities under the Plan.  The
Committee is the administrator of the Plan within the meaning Section 3(16)(A)
of ERISA.   As administrator, the Committee has the authority (without
limitation as to other authority) to delegate its duties to agents and to make
rules and regulations that it believes are necessary or appropriate to carry
out the Plan.  The Committee has the discretion (i) to interpret and construe
the terms and provisions of the Plan (including any rules or regulations
adopted under the Plan), (ii) to determine questions of eligibility to
participate in the Plan and (iii) to make factual determinations in connection
with any of the foregoing.  A decision of the Committee with respect to any
matter pertaining to the Plan including without limitation the Employees
determined to be Participants, the benefits payable, and the construction or
interpretation of any provision thereof, shall be conclusive and binding upon
all interested persons.  Benefits under the Plan shall be paid only if the
Committee decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to benefits
under the Plan.  

   ARTICLE X 
CLAIMS PROCEDURE   

  10.1
          Claim   .  A person with an interest in the Plan shall have the
right to file a claim for benefits under the Plan and to appeal any denial of a
claim for benefits.  Any request or application for a Plan benefit or to
clarify the claimant's rights to future benefits under the terms of the Plan
shall be considered to be a claim.  

  10.2
            Written Claim   .  A claim for benefits will be considered as
having been made when submitted in writing by the claimant (or by such
claimant's authorized representative) to the Committee.  No particular form is
required for the claim, but the written claim must identify the name of the
claimant and describe generally the benefit to which the claimant believes he
is entitled.  The claim may be delivered personally during normal business hours
or mailed to the Committee.  

  10.3
            Committee Determination   .  The Committee will determine whether,
or to what extent, the claim may be allowed or denied under the terms of the
Plan.  If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant shall be so
informed by written notice within 90 days after the day the claim is submitted
unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the
claim.  If such an extension of time for processing is required, written notice
of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of
the initial 90-day period.  Such extension may not exceed an additional 90 days
from the end of the initial 90-day period.  The extension notice shall indicate
the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which
the Plan expects to render the final decision.  If notice of denial of a claim
(in whole or in part) is not furnished within the initial 90-day period after
the claim is submitted (or, if applicable, the extended 90-day period), the
claimant shall consider that his claim has been denied just as if he had
received actual notice of denial.  

  10.4
           Notice of Determination    .  The notice informing the claimant
that his claim has been wholly or partially denied shall be written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include:  

(a)            The
specific reason(s) for the denial.  

  (b)            Specific
reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based.  

  (c)            A
description of any additional material or information necessary for the
claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or
information is necessary.  

  (d)            Appropriate
information as to the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to submit his
claim for review.  

  10.5
           Appeal   .  If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the
claimant (or his authorized representative) may file an appeal of the denied
claim with the Committee requesting that the claim be reviewed.  The Committee
shall conduct a full and fair review of each appealed claim and its denial. 
Unless the Committee notifies the claimant that due to the nature of the
benefit and other attendant circumstances he is entitled to a greater period of
time within which to submit his request for review of a denied claim, the
claimant shall have 60 days after he (or his authorized representative)
receives written notice of denial of his claim within which such request must
be submitted to the Committee.  

  10.6
           Request for Review   .  The request for review of a denied claim
must be made in writing.  In connection with making such request, the claimant
or his authorized representative may:  

  (a)            Review pertinent documents.  

  (b)            Submit issues and comments in
writing.  

  10.7
           Determination of Appeal   .  The decision of the Committee
regarding the appeal shall be promptly given to the claimant in writing and
shall normally be given no later than 60 days following the receipt of the
request for review.  However, if special circumstances (for example, if the
Committee decides to hold a hearing on the appeal) require a further extension
of time for processing, the decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but
no later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review.  However, if
the Committee holds regularly scheduled meetings at least quarterly, a decision
on review shall be made by no later than the date of the meeting which
immediately follows the Plan's receipt of a request for review, unless the
request is filed within 30 days preceding the date of such meeting.  In such
case, a decision may be made by no later than the date of the second meeting
following the Plan's receipt of the request for review.  If special
circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a hearing on the
appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the decision shall
be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than the third meeting following
the Plan's receipt of the request for review. If special circumstances require
that the decision will be made beyond the initial time for furnishing the
decision, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant
(or his authorized representative) prior to the commencement of the extension. 
The decision on review shall be in writing and shall be furnished to the
claimant or to his authorized representative within the appropriate time for
the decision.  

  10.8
           Hearing   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, decide to
hold a hearing if it determines that a hearing is necessary or appropriate in
order to make a full and fair review of the appealed claim.  

  10.9
           Decision   .  The decision on review shall include specific reasons
for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the
claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on
which the decision is based.  

  10.10
      Exhaustion of Appeals.  A person must exhaust his rights to file a claim
and to request a review of the denial of his claim before bringing any civil
action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of the Plan, to enforce
his rights under the terms of the Plan, or to clarify his rights to future
benefits under the terms of the Plan.  

  10.11
      Committee s Authority.  The Committee shall exercise its responsibility
and authority under this claims procedure as a fiduciary and, in such capacity,
shall have the discretionary authority and responsibility (1) to interpret and
construe the Plan and any rules or regulations under the Plan, (2) to determine
the eligibility of Employees to participate in the Plan, and the rights of
Participants to receive benefits under the Plan, and (3) to make factual
determinations in connection with any of the foregoing.  Benefits under the
Plan shall be paid only if the Committee decides in its discretion that the
applicant is entitled to benefits under the Plan.  

  10.12    
Civil Action.  Any civil action brought with respect to a decision of the
Committee on review shall be brought within one year of the mailing of the
written decision to the claimant.  

ARTICLE XI 
NATURE OF COMPANY'S OBLIGATION   

  11.1
       Nature of Obligation.  The Company's obligation to the Participant under
the Plan shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay.  The rights of a
Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan shall be solely those of an unsecured
general creditor of the Company.  The Company shall not be obligated under any
circumstances to set aside or hold assets to fund its financial obligations
under the Plan.  

  11.2
        Financing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole
discretion establish such accounts, trusts, insurance policies or arrangements,
or any other mechanisms it deems necessary or appropriate to account for or
fund its obligations under the Plan.  Any assets which the Company may set
aside, acquire or hold to help cover its financial liabilities under the Plan
are and remain general assets of the Company subject to the claims of its
creditors.  The Company does not give, and the Plan does not give, any
beneficial ownership interest in any assets of the Company to a Participant or
Beneficiary.  All rights of ownership in any assets are and remain in the
Company.  Any general asset used or acquired by      

the
Company in connection with the liabilities it has assumed under the Plan shall
not be deemed to be held under any trust for the benefit of the Participant or
any Beneficiary, and no general asset shall be considered security for the
performance of the obligations of the Company.  Any asset shall remain a
general, unpledged, and unrestricted asset of the Company.  The Company's
liability for payment of benefits shall be determined only under the provisions
of the Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.  

   ARTICLE XII 
GENERAL PROVISIONS   

  12.1
         No Right to Employment.  Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give
any person the right to remain in the employ of the Company or affect the right
of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment with or without cause.  

  12.2
         No Assignment.  No right or benefit under the Plan shall be subject to
anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge.  Any
attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge these
benefits shall be void.  No right or benefit under the Plan shall in any manner
be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of the
person entitled to the benefit.  If any Participant or Beneficiary under the
Plan should become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign,
pledge, encumber or charge any right to a benefit hereunder, then the right or
benefit, in the discretion of the Committee, shall cease.  In these
circumstances, the Committee may hold or apply the benefit payment or payments,
or any part of it, for the benefit of the Participant or his Beneficiary, the
Participant's spouse, children, or other dependents, or any of them, in any
manner and in any portion that the Committee may deem proper.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and subject to
Section 6.6, the Committee shall honor a judgment, order or decree from a state
domestic relations court which requires the payment of part or all of a
Participant's or Beneficiary's interest under the Plan to an  alternate
payee  as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.  

  12.3
        Withholding.  Any amount required to be withheld under applicable
Federal, state and local tax laws (including any amounts required to be withheld
under Section 3121(v) of the Code) will be withheld in such manner as the
Committee will determine and any payment under the Plan will be reduced by the
amount so withheld, as well as by any other lawful withholding.  

  12.4
        Governing Law.  The Plan shall be construed and administered in
accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina to the extent that such
laws are not preempted by Federal law.  

  12.5        
Compliance with Section 409A of the Code.  It is intended that Part II comply
with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so as to prevent the inclusion
in gross income of any amounts deferred hereunder in a taxable year that is
prior to the taxable year or years in which such amounts would otherwise
actually be paid or made available to Participants or Beneficiaries.  The Plan
shall be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects such
intent, and the Company shall not take any action that would be inconsistent
with such intent.  Although the Company shall use its best efforts to avoid the
imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code,
the tax treatment of deferrals under the Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. 
Neither the Company, the other members of the Affiliated Group, their respective
directors, officers, employees and advisors, the Board of Directors, nor any
committee shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other
monetary amounts owed by any Participant, Beneficiary or other taxpayer as a
result of the Plan.  Any reference in the Plan to Section 409A of the Code will
also include any proposed, temporary or final regulations, or any other
guidance, promulgated with respect to such Section 409A of the Code by the U.S.
Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.  For purposes of the
Plan, the phrase  permitted by Section 409A of the Code,  or words or
phrases of similar import, shall mean that the event or circumstance shall only
be permitted to the extent it would not cause an amount deferred or payable
under the Plan to be includible in the gross income of a Participant or
Beneficiary under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.  

  12.6         
Electronic or Other Media.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to
the contrary, including any provision that requires the use of a written
instrument, the Committee may establish procedures for the use of electronic or
other media in communications and transactions between the Plan or the
Committee and Participants and Beneficiaries.  Electronic or other media may
include, but are not limited to, e-mail, the Internet, intranet systems and
automated telephonic response systems.  

   ARTICLE XIII 
MID-CAREER BENEFIT   

  13.1
        Cinergy SERP.  The Cinergy Corp. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(the  Cinergy SERP ) was originally adopted effective as of January
1, 1983 by PSI Energy Inc. as the PSI Energy, Inc. Supplemental Retirement
Plan, was renamed effective as of January 1, 1997, and was last amended and
restated effective as of January 1, 1999, and has been subsequently amended. 
The Plan is intended as a continuation, replacement and complete restatement of
the Cinergy SERP for the only individual (the  Legacy SERP Participant ) who,
as of December 31, 2008, was an employee of the Company, participated in the
Cinergy SERP and had not yet commenced payment thereunder, and all rights,
benefits and obligations provided under the Cinergy SERP with respect to such
individual shall be extinguished and shall be provided hereunder.  

  13.2         
Eligibility.  The Legacy SERP Participant shall be eligible for a Mid-Career
Benefit under the Plan.  The Mid-Career Benefit (or spouse's benefit with
respect to the Mid-Career Benefit) under the Plan shall be calculated in the
same manner as such benefit would have been calculated under the Mid-Career
Benefit of the Cinergy SERP as in effect immediately prior to this restatement
of the Plan.  For purposes of clarity, the Mid-Career Benefit shall be
determined under the Traditional Program, and shall be reduced by the Legacy SERP
Participant s: (a) benefit under the Cinergy Pension Plan s Traditional Program
and the Cash Balance Program, (b) Cash Balance Make-Whole Account and
Supplemental Account and (c) Social Security benefits (50%), all in accordance
with the procedures contained in the Cinergy Pension Plan.  

  13.3.       
Payment.  Subject to provisions of Article VI, the Legacy SERP Participant s
entire benefit under the Plan shall be paid in the form of an annuity, from
among the payment options selected by the Legacy SERP Participant, which
options shall be the same as those available for a Traditional Program
Benefit.  Payment of the Legacy SERP Participant s benefit under the Plan shall
commence as of the first day of the month following the Legacy SERP
Participant s Separation from Service or such later date required by Section
6.5.  In the event that the Legacy SERP Participant dies      

prior
to the commencement of the payment of his Plan benefit, such benefit shall be
paid to his spouse, if any, as if such benefit were a Traditional Program
Benefit under Section 7.2.   

  IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, this amendment and restatement of the Plan is executed on
behalf of Cinergy Corp. this 31st day of December, 2008.

 RETENTION AWARD AGREEMENT

EXHIBIT
10.56   

RETENTION AWARD
AGREEMENT   

THIS
RETENTION AWARD AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ), effective as of July 9, 2012, is
made by and between Duke Energy Corporation, and Lloyd Yates (the  Employee ),
an employee of Duke Energy Corporation or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates
(collectively referred to herein as the  Company ).  

1.                     Retention Award    .   

(a)            Grant of Retention
Award    .
        In consideration of the Employee s continuing service for the Company,
the Company hereby grants to the Employee the opportunity to earn a retention
award (the  Retention Award ) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in the
amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000).    

(b)             Vesting Schedule    .         Subject to
earlier forfeiture as described below, the Retention Award shall become fully
vested in its entirety if the Employee is continuously employed by the Company
until the second (2 nd ) anniversary of the closing of the Merger (as
defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Duke Energy Corporation,
Diamond Acquisition Corporation and Progress Energy, Inc., dated as of January
8, 2011) (the  Vesting Date ).   

(c)           Forfeiture of
Retention Award    . 
The Employee shall forfeit the Retention Award in its entirety upon (i) failing
to remain continuously employed with the Company for any reason through the
Vesting Date in accordance with Section 1(b) or (ii) breaching this Agreement. 
For purposes of clarity, the Retention Award shall be forfeited in the event
that the Employee is entitled to payments under the terms of the Progress
Energy, Inc. Management Change-in-Control Plan.  

2.                Crediting
of Vested
Retention Award    . 
In the event the Retention Award becomes fully vested in accordance with
Section 1(b), the vested Retention Award (less applicable taxes, including
employment taxes, upon vesting) shall be credited on the Vesting Date to a
subaccount under the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Savings Plan (the
 Plan ), which subaccount shall be credited with gains and losses in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and shall be paid to the Employee in the form of
monthly installments over a period of seven years as provided under the terms
of the Plan.  Except as explicitly set forth herein, no payments made pursuant
to this Agreement will be considered when determining the Employee s benefits
under the Company s other benefit plans (   e.g.   , 401(k) plan, defined
benefit pension plan, etc.).    

3.             Miscellaneous    .  The contingent
rights set forth in this Agreement are not transferable otherwise than by will
or the laws of descent and distribution.  Nothing in this Agreement shall
restrict the right of the Company to terminate the Employee s employment at any
time with or without  cause .  The terms of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns, and
the Employee and the Employee s beneficiaries, executors, administrators, heirs
and successors.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, and
this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or
unenforceable provision has been omitted.  The headings of the Sections of this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for
interpretation or construction, and shall not constitute a part of this
Agreement.  Except to the extent pre-empted by federal law, this Agreement and
the Employee s rights under it shall be construed and determined in accordance
with the laws of the State of North Carolina.  This Agreement contains the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject
matter contained in this Agreement, and supersedes all prior communications,
representations and negotiations in respect thereto.  This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  The Company, or
its delegate, shall have final authority to interpret and construe this
Agreement and to make any and all determinations thereunder, and its decision
shall be binding and conclusive upon the Employee and the Employee s legal
representative in respect of any questions arising under this Agreement.  No
change, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
valid unless the same be in writing and signed by the parties.  Any payments to
Employee under this Agreement shall be paid from the Company s general assets,
and Employee shall have the status of a general unsecured creditor with respect
to the Company s obligations to make payments under this Agreement.         

4.              Confidentiality
of this Agreement    . 
The Employee specifically agrees and understands that the existence and terms
of this Agreement are strictly CONFIDENTIAL and that such confidentiality is a

(b)             Vesting Schedule    .         Subject to

The Employee shall forfeit the Retention Award in its entirety upon (i) failing
to remain continuously employed with the Company for any reason through the
Vesting Date in accordance with Section 1(b) or (ii) breaching this Agreement. 
For purposes of clarity, the Retention Award shall be forfeited in the event

2.                Crediting
of Vested
Retention Award    . 
In the event the Retention Award becomes fully vested in accordance with

 Plan ), which subaccount shall be credited with gains and losses in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and shall be paid to the Employee in the form of

time with or without  cause .  The terms of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns, and

agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter
contained in this Agreement, and supersedes all prior communications,

described in this Section 4.1 ( Severance Payments ).  

   (A)         A
lump-sum payment equal to (i) the Executive s annual bonus payment earned for
any completed bonus year prior to termination of employment, if not previously
paid, plus (ii) a pro-rata amount of the Executive s target bonus under any
performance-based bonus plan, program, or arrangement in which the Executive

program goals had been met, pro-rated based on the number of days of service

       (B)         In
lieu of any severance benefit otherwise payable to the Executive, the Company
shall pay to the Executive a lump sum severance payment, in cash, equal to two
(or, if less, the number of years (including partial years) until the Executive
reaches the Company s mandatory retirement age, provided that the Company
adopts a mandatory retirement age pursuant to 29 USC  631(c)) times the sum of
(i) the Executive s base salary as in effect immediately prior to the Date of
Termination or, if higher, in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence
of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, and (ii) the Executive s
target short-term incentive bonus opportunity for the fiscal year in which the
Date of Termination occurs or, if higher, the fiscal year in which the first
event or circumstance constituting Good Reason occurs.  The amount described in
this Section 4.1(B) shall be paid within 30 calendar days after the Release
Deadline, or such later date as may be required under Section 13.1.  

   (C)         For
a period of two years immediately following the Date of Termination (or, if
less, the period until the Executive reaches the Company s mandatory retirement
age, provided that the Company adopts a mandatory retirement age pursuant to 29
USC  631(c)) (the  Severance Period ), the Company shall arrange to provide the
Executive and his or her dependents medical and dental insurance benefits
substantially similar to those provided to the Executive and his or her
dependents immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable
to the Executive, those provided to the Executive and his or her dependents
immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance
constituting Good Reason, at      

no greater after tax cost
to the Executive than the after tax cost to the Executive immediately prior to
such date or occurrence.  Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive
pursuant to this Section 4.1(C) shall be reduced to the extent benefits of the
same type are received by or made available to the Executive during the
Severance Period as a result of subsequent employment (and any such benefits
received by or made available to the Executive shall be reported to the Company
by the Executive).  In addition, the Company shall make a lump sum cash
payment, payable within 30 calendar days after the Release Deadline or such
later date as may be required under Section 13.1, in an amount equal to the
anticipated cost of basic life insurance coverage for the Severance Period,
based on the Company s assumed cost for such coverage for internal accounting
purposes at the Date of Termination.  The continued benefits described in this
paragraph 4.1(C) that are taxable benefits (and that are not disability pay or
death benefit plans within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) are
intended to comply, to the maximum extent possible, with the exception to
Section 409A of the Code set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury
Regulations.  To the extent that any of those benefits either do not qualify
for that exception, or are provided beyond the applicable time periods set
forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations, then they shall
be subject to the following additional rules: (1) any reimbursement of eligible
expenses shall be paid within 10 calendar days following Executive's written
request for reimbursement, or such later date as may be required under Section
13.1;  provided that the Executive provides written notice no later than 15
calendar days prior to the last day of the calendar year following the calendar
year in which the expense was incurred; (2) the amount of expenses eligible for
reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any calendar year shall not
affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits
to be provided, during any other calendar year; and (3) the right to reimbursement
or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another
benefit.  

   (D)         Executive's
benefits accrued or credited through the Date of Termination under the DC
Pension Plan that are not vested as of the Date of Termination but that would
have vested had Executive remained employed by the Company for the remainder of
the Term shall be fully vested as of the Date of Termination and paid in
accordance with the terms of the applicable plan.  In addition to the benefits
to which the Executive is entitled under the DC Pension Plan, the Company shall
pay the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the amount that would
have been contributed thereto by the Company on the Executive s behalf during
the Severance Period, determined (x) as if the Executive made the maximum
permissible contributions thereto during such period, (y) as if the Executive
earned compensation during such period equal to the sum of the Executive s base
    salary and target
bonus as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or, if higher,
as in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the first event or
circumstance constituting Good Reason, and (z) without regard to any amendment
to the DC Pension Plan made subsequent to a Change in Control and on or prior
to the Date of Termination, which amendment adversely affects in any manner the
computation of benefits thereunder.  The amount described in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be paid within 30 calendar days after the Release
Deadline, or such later date as may be required under Section 13.1.  

   (E)         Executive's
benefits accrued or credited through the Date of Termination of employment
under the DB Pension Plan that are not vested as of the Date of Termination but
that would have vested had Executive remained employed by the Company for the
remainder of the Term shall be fully vested as of the Date of Termination and
paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan. In addition to the
benefits to which the Executive is entitled under the DB Pension Plan, the
Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the amount
that would have been allocated thereunder by the Company in respect of the
Executive (or accrued by the Executive, which accrual shall be calculated based
on the actuarial assumptions contained in the DB Pension Plan) during the
Severance Period, determined (x) as if the Executive earned compensation during
such period equal to the sum of the Executive s base salary and target bonus as
in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or, if higher, as in
effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the first event or circumstance
constituting Good Reason, and (y) without regard to any amendment to the DB
Pension Plan made subsequent to a Change in Control and on or prior to the Date
of Termination, which amendment adversely affects in any manner the computation
of benefits thereunder.  The amount described in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be paid within 30 calendar days after the Release Deadline, or
such later date as may be required under Section 13.1.  

   (F)         Notwithstanding
the terms of any award agreement or plan document to the contrary, the
Executive shall be entitled to receive continued vesting of any long term incentive
awards, including awards of stock options but excluding awards of restricted
stock, held by the Executive at the time of his or her termination of
employment that are not vested or exercisable on such date, in accordance with
their terms as if the Executive s employment had not terminated, for the
duration of the Severance Period, with any options or similar rights to remain
exercisable (to the extent exercisable at the end of the Severance Period) for
a period of 90 days following the close of the Severance Period, but not beyond
the maximum original term of such options or rights.  

   4.2         
(A)        Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, in the event that any payment or benefit received
or to be received by the Executive (including any payment or benefit received
in connection with a Change in Control or the termination of the Executive s
employment, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan,
arrangement or agreement) (all such payments and benefits, including the
Severance Payments, being hereinafter referred to as the  Total Payments )
would be subject (in whole or part), to the Excise Tax, then, after taking into
account any reduction in the Total Payments provided by reason of Section 280G
of the Code in such other plan, arrangement or agreement, the Severance
Payments shall be reduced    
to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to
the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so
reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local
income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the
phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such
reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such
Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of
federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of
Excise Tax to which the Executive would be subject in respect of such unreduced
Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total
Payments).  If a reduction in Severance Payments is necessary pursuant to this
Section 4.2(A), then the reduction shall occur in the following order:  (i)
cash payments under Section 4.1(A)(ii), 4.2(B), 4.2(D) and 4.2(E); (ii)
cancellation of accelerated vesting of performance-based equity awards (based
on the reverse order of the date of grant); (iii) cancellation of accelerated
vesting of other equity awards (based on the reverse order of the date of
grant); and (iv) reduction of welfare benefits.    

  (B)         For
purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will
be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt
or enjoyment of which the Executive shall have waived at such time and in such
manner as not to constitute a  payment  within the meaning of Section 280G(b)
of the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments
shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel ( Tax
Counsel ) who is reasonably acceptable to the Executive and selected by the
accounting firm (the  Auditor ) which was, immediately prior to the Change in
Control, the Company s independent auditor, does not constitute a  parachute
payment  within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by
reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax,
no portion      

of such Total Payments shall be taken into
account which, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable
compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such
reasonable compensation, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any
deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined
by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4)
of the Code.  

  (C)         At
the time that payments are made under this Agreement, the Company shall provide
the Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in which such
payments were calculated and the basis for such calculations including, without
limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from Tax
Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or
advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).  

  5.        Notice
of Termination   . After a Change in Control and during the Term, any
purported termination of the Executive s employment (other than by reason of
death) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination from one party
hereto to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 12 hereof. For
purposes of this Agreement, a  Notice of Termination  shall mean a notice which
shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied
upon.  

       6.        No
Mitigation   . The Company agrees that, if the Executive s employment with the
Company terminates during the Term, the Executive is not required to seek other
employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to the
Executive by the Company pursuant to Section 4 hereof. Further, except as
specifically provided in Section 4.1(C) hereof, no payment or benefit provided
for in this Agreement shall be reduced by any compensation earned by the
Executive as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement
benefits or otherwise.  The Company's obligation to make the payments provided
for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall
be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may have against the Executive or others.  

  7.           Restrictive
Covenants   .    

  7.1            Noncompetition
and Nonsolicitation   .   During
the Restricted Period (as defined below), the Executive agrees that he or she
shall not, without the Company s prior written consent, for any reason,
directly or indirectly, either as principal, agent, manager, employee, partner,
shareholder, director, officer, consultant or otherwise (A) become engaged or
involved, in a manner that relates to or is similar in nature to those duties
performed by Executive at any time during his or her employment with the
Company, in any business (other than as a less-than three percent (3%) equity
owner of any corporation traded on any national, international or regional
stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market) that competes with the
Company or any of its Affiliates in the business of production, transmission,
distribution, or retail or wholesale marketing or selling of electricity;
resale or arranging for the purchase or for the resale, brokering, marketing,
or trading of electricity or derivatives thereof; energy management and the
provision of energy solutions; development and management of fiber optic
communications systems; development and operation of power generation
facilities, domestically and abroad; and any other business in which the
Company, including Affiliates, is engaged at the termination of the Executive s
continuous employment with the Company, including Affiliates; or (B) induce or
attempt to induce any customer, client, supplier, employee, agent or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Affiliates to reduce,
terminate, restrict or otherwise alter its business relationship with the
Company or its Affiliates. The provisions of this Section 7.1 shall be limited
in scope and effective only within one or more of the following geographical
areas: (i) The States of North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, and
Indiana, or (ii) any other state in the United States where the Company
including Affiliates, has at least U.S. $25 million in capital deployed as of
the termination of the Executive's continuous employment with the Company,
including Affiliates; or (iii) any state or country with respect to which was
conducted a business of the Company, including Affiliates, which business, or
oversight of which business, constituted any part of the Executive's
employment.  The parties intend the above geographical areas to be completely
severable       and independent, and any invalidity or
unenforceability of this Agreement with respect to any one area shall not
render this Agreement unenforceable as applied to any one or more of the other
areas. Nothing in Section 7.1 shall be construed to prohibit the Executive
being retained during the Restricted Period in a capacity as an attorney
licensed to practice law, or to restrict the Executive from providing advice
and counsel in such capacity, in any jurisdiction where such prohibition or
restriction is contrary to law.  

   7.2            Restricted
Period   . For purposes of this Agreement,  Restricted Period  shall mean the
period of the Executive s employment during the Term and, in the event of a
termination of the Executive s employment following a Change in Control that
entitles Executive to Severance Payments covered by Section 4 hereof, the
twelve (12) month period following such termination of employment, commencing
from the Date of Termination.  

  7.3            Forfeiture
and Repayments   . The Executive agrees that, in the event he or she violates
the provisions of Section 7 hereof during the Restricted Period, he or she will
forfeit and not be entitled to any Severance Payments or any non-cash benefits
or rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, stock option
rights), other than the payments provided under Section 3 hereof. The Executive
further agrees that, in the event he or she violates the provisions of Section
7 hereof following the payment or commencement of any Severance Payments, (A)
he or she will forfeit and not be entitled to any further Severance Payments,
and (B) he or she will be obligated to repay to the Company an amount in
respect of the Severance Payments previously made to him or her under Section 4
hereof (the  Repayment Amount ). The Repayment Amount shall be determined by
aggregating the cash Severance Payments made to the Executive and multiplying
the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
full and partial calendar months remaining in the Severance Period at the time
of the violation (rounded to the nearest quarter of a month), and the
denominator of which is twenty-four (24). The Repayment Amount shall be paid to
the Company in cash in a single sum within ten (10) business days after the
first date of the violation, whether or not the Company has knowledge of the
violation or has made a demand for payment. Any such payment made following
such date shall bear interest at a rate equal to the prime lending rate of
Citibank, N.A. (as periodically set) plus 1%. Furthermore, in the event the
Executive violates the provisions of Section 7 hereof, and notwithstanding the
terms of any award agreement or plan document to the contrary (which shall be
considered to be amended to the extent necessary to reflect the terms hereof),
the Executive shall immediately forfeit the right to exercise any stock option
or similar rights that are outstanding at the time of the violation, and the
Repayment Amount, calculated as provided above, shall be increased by the
amount of any gains (measured, if applicable, by the difference between the
aggregate fair market value on the date of exercise of shares underlying the
stock option or similar right and the aggregate exercise price of such stock
option or similar right) realized by the Executive upon the exercise of stock
options or similar rights or vesting of restricted stock or other equity
compensation within the one-year period prior to the first date of the
violation.    

7.4            Permissive
Release   . The Executive may request that the Company release him or her from
the restrictive covenants of Section 7.1 hereof upon the condition that the
Executive forfeit and repay all termination benefits and rights provided for in
Section 4.1 hereof. The Company may, in its sole discretion, grant such a
release in whole or in part or may reject such request and continue to enforce
its rights under this Section 7.  

   7.5            Consideration;
Survival   . The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the compensation and
benefits provided in this Agreement constitute adequate and sufficient
consideration for the covenants made by the Executive in this Section 7 and in
the remainder of this Agreement. As further consideration for the covenants
made by the Executive in this Section 7 and in the remainder of this Agreement,
the Company has provided and will provide the Executive certain proprietary and
other confidential information about the Company, including, but not limited
to, business plans and strategies, budgets and budgetary projections, income
and earnings projections and statements, cost analyses and assessments, and/or
business assessments of legal and regulatory issues. The Executive s
obligations under this Section 7 shall survive any termination of his or her
employment as specified herein.  

   8.        Confidentiality   .
The Executive acknowledges that during the Executive s employment with the
Company or any of its Affiliates, the Executive will acquire, be exposed to and
have access to, non-public material, data and information of the Company and
its Affiliates and/or their customers or clients that is confidential,
proprietary, and/or a trade secret ( Confidential Information ). At all times,
both during and after the Term, the Executive shall keep and retain in
confidence and shall not disclose, except as required and authorized in the
course of the Executive s employment with the Company or any its Affiliates, to
any person, firm or corporation, or use for his or her own purposes, any
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, such Confidential
Information shall include, but shall not be limited to: sales methods,
information concerning principals or customers, advertising methods, financial
affairs or methods of procurement, marketing and business plans, strategies
(including risk strategies), projections, business opportunities, inventions,
designs, drawings, research and development plans, client lists, sales and cost
information and financial results and performance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  Confidential Information  shall not include any information known
generally to the public (other than as a result of unauthorized disclosure by
the Executive or by the Company or its Affiliates). The Executive acknowledges
that the obligations pertaining to the confidentiality and non-disclosure of
Confidential Information shall remain in effect at all times after termination
of employment, or until the Company or its Affiliates has released any such
information into the public domain, in which case the Executive s obligation
hereunder shall cease with respect only to such information so released into
the public domain.  The Executive s obligations under this Section 8 shall
survive any termination of his or her employment. If the Executive receives a
subpoena or other judicial process requiring that he or she produce, provide or
testify about Confidential Information, the Executive shall notify the Company
and cooperate fully with the Company in resisting disclosure of the
Confidential Information. The Executive acknowledges that the     Company has the right
either in the name of the Executive or in its own name to oppose or move to
quash any subpoena or other legal process directed to the Executive regarding
Confidential Information. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Executive remains free to report or otherwise communicate any
nuclear safety concern, any workplace safety concern, or any public safety
concern to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, United States Department of
Labor, or any other appropriate federal or state governmental agency, and the
Executive remains free to participate in any federal or state administrative,
judicial, or legislative proceeding or investigation with respect to any claims
and matters not resolved and terminated pursuant to this Agreement. With
respect to any claims and matters resolved and terminated pursuant to this
Agreement, the Executive is free to participate in any federal or state
administrative, judicial, or legislative proceeding or investigation if
subpoenaed. The Executive shall give the Company, through its legal counsel,
notice, including a copy of the subpoena, within twenty-four (24) hours of
receipt thereof.  

   9.        Return
of Company Property   . All records, files, lists, including, computer
generated lists, drawings, documents, equipment and similar items relating to
the business of the Company and its Affiliates which the Executive shall
prepare or receive from the Company or its Affiliates shall remain the sole and
exclusive property of Company and its Affiliates. Upon termination of the Executive s
employment for any reason, the Executive shall promptly return all property of
the Company or any of its Affiliates in his or her possession. The Executive
further represents that he or she will not copy or cause to be copied, print
out or cause to be printed out any software, documents or other materials
originating with or belonging to the Company or any of its Affiliates.  

   10.    
   Acknowledgement and Enforcement   . The Executive acknowledges that the
restrictions contained in this Agreement with regards to the Executive s use of
Confidential Information and his or her future business activities are fair,
reasonable and necessary to protect the Company s legitimate protectable
interests, particularly given the competitive nature and broad scope of the Company s
business and that of its Affiliates, as well as the Executive s position with
the Company. The Executive further acknowledges that the Company may have no
adequate means to protect its rights under this Agreement other than by
securing an injunction (a court order prohibiting the Executive from violating
this Agreement). The Executive therefore agrees that the Company, in addition
to any other right or remedy it may have, shall be entitled to enforce this
Agreement by obtaining a preliminary and permanent injunction and any other
appropriate equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
Executive acknowledges that the recovery of damages will not be an adequate
means to redress a breach of this Agreement, but nothing in this Section 10
shall prohibit the Company from pursuing any remedies in addition to injunctive
relief, including recovery of damages and/or any forfeiture or repayment
obligations provided for herein.  

   11.     
   Successors; Binding Agreement   .   

  11.1       In
addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any successor to the Company,
the Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by     purchase, merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or
assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement
in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to
perform it if no such succession had taken place.  

  11.2       This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive s
personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive shall die while
any amount would still be payable to the Executive hereunder (other than amounts
which, by their terms, terminate upon the death of the Executive) if the
Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided
herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the
executors, personal representatives or administrators of the Executive s
estate;    provided   ,    however   , such amounts shall be offset by any
amounts owed by the Executive to the Company.  

12.          Notices   . All notices or other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given (a) when delivered personally, (b) upon confirmation of receipt when
such notice or other communication is sent by facsimile, (c) one day after
timely delivery to an overnight delivery courier, or (d) when delivered or
mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid. The addresses for such notices shall be as follows:  

  To the Company:  

  Duke Energy Corporation  

  Post Office Box 1006, EC3XB  

  Charlotte, North Carolina
28201-1006  

  Attention: Chief Executive
Officer  

To the Executive:  

      At the
most recent address on file in the records of the Company  

  Either party hereto may, by
notice to the other, change its address for receipt of notices hereunder.  

   13.     
   Section 409A.       

  13.1          
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Executive is a  specified employee  on the Date of Termination, as
determined under the Company's policy for identifying specified employees, then
to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, all
payments, benefits or reimbursements paid or provided under this Agreement that
constitute a  deferral of compensation  within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code, that are provided as a result of a  separation from
service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and that would
otherwise be paid or provided during the first six months following the Date of
Termination shall be accumulated through and paid or provided (together with
interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code
in effect on the Date of Termination) within 30 calendar days after     the first business day that is more than six months
following the Date of Termination (or, if the Executive dies during such
six-month period, within 30 calendar days after the Executive's death).    

  13.2          
It is intended that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement
shall either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement shall be construed,
administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the
Company shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such intent. 
Without limiting the foregoing, the payments and benefits provided under this
Agreement may not be deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out or modified in a
manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section
409A of the Code upon Executive.    

  13.3         
It is the intention of the Company and the Executive that this Agreement not
result in unfavorable tax consequences to the Executive under Section 409A of
the Code. Accordingly, the Executive consents to any amendment of this
Agreement as the Company may reasonably make in furtherance of such intention,
and the Company shall promptly provide, or make available to, the Executive a
copy of such amendment.  Although the Company shall use its best efforts to
avoid the imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of
the Code, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under this Agreement is
not warranted or guaranteed.  Neither the Company, its affiliates, nor their
respective directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be held liable for
any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by the Executive
or other taxpayer as a result of the Agreement.    

   14.     
   Miscellaneous   . Except as otherwise provided in Section 13 hereof, no
provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such
waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the
Executive and the Chief Executive Officer (or such officer as may be
specifically designated by the Chief Executive Officer). No waiver by either
party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or of any
lack of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be
performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar
provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. This
Agreement supersedes any other agreements or representations, oral or
otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof which
have been made by either party;    provided   ,    however   , that this
Agreement shall supersede any agreement setting forth the terms and conditions
of the Executive s employment with the Company only in the event that the
Executive s employment with the Company is terminated during the Term and on or
within two years following a Change in Control, by the Company other than for
Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason. The validity, interpretation,
construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the State of North Carolina. All references to sections of the Exchange Act or
the Code shall be deemed also to refer to any successor provisions to such
sections. Any payments provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any
applicable withholding required under federal, state or local law and any
additional withholding to which the Executive has agreed and no such payments
shall be treated as creditable compensation under any other employee benefit
plan, program, arrangement or agreement of or with the Company or its
affiliates. The obligations of the Company and the Executive under this
Agreement which by their nature may require either partial or total performance
after the expiration of the Term (including, without limitation, those under
Section 4 hereof) shall survive such expiration.  

   15.      
Certain Legal Fees. To provide the Executive with reasonable assurance that the
purposes of this Agreement will not be frustrated by the cost of enforcement,
the Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable attorneys  fees and
expenses incurred by the Executive during the two-year period immediately
following the Executive's Date of Termination as a result of a claim that the
Company has breached or otherwise failed to perform its obligations     under this Agreement or
any provision hereof, regardless of which party, if any, prevails in the
contest; provided, however, that Company shall not be responsible for such fees
and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with a claim made by the
Executive that the trier of fact in any such contest finds to be frivolous or
if the Executive is determined to have breached his or her obligations under
Sections 7, 8, 9, 16, or 17 of this Agreement; and provided further, however,
the Company shall not be responsible for such fees or expenses in excess of
$50,000 in the aggregate.  The reimbursement, if any, shall be paid to the
Executive within 10 calendar days following the expiration of the two-year
period described above,      

provided that the Executive
shall have submitted an invoice for such fees and expenses at least 30 calendar
days prior to the expiration of that period.  The amount of such legal fees and
expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall
not affect the legal fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in
any other calendar year, and the Executive s right to have the Company pay such
legal fees and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other
benefit.      

   16.     
Cooperation. The Executive agrees that he or she will fully cooperate in any
litigation, proceeding, investigation or inquiry in which the Company or its
Affiliates may be or become involved. The Executive also agrees to cooperate
fully with any internal investigation or inquiry conducted by or on behalf of
the Company. Such cooperation shall include the Executive making himself or
herself available, upon the request of the Company or its counsel, for
depositions, court appearances and interviews by Company s counsel. The Company
shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by him or her in connection with such cooperation. To the
maximum extent permitted by law, the Executive agrees that he or she will
notify the Board if he or she is contacted by any government agency or any
other person contemplating or maintaining any claim or legal action against the
Company or its Affiliates or by any agent or attorney of such person. Nothing
contained in this Section 16 shall preclude the Executive from providing
truthful testimony in response to a valid subpoena, court order, regulatory
request or as may be required by law.  To the extent required to comply with
Section 409A of the Code, any payment or reimbursement of expenses pursuant to
this Section 16 that will not be excluded from the Executive's income when
received is subject to the following requirements: (i) the expenses to be
reimbursed must be incurred during the Executive's lifetime; (ii) the amount of
expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the
expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided in any
other calendar year; (iii) any reimbursement of eligible expenses shall be paid
within 10 calendar days following Executive's written request for
reimbursement, or such later date as may be required under Section 13.1;  provided
that the Executive provides written notice no later than 15 calendar days prior
to the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
expense was incurred; and (iv) the right to reimbursement is not subject to
liquidation or exchange for another benefit.    

   17.      
Non-Disparagement. The Executive agrees that he or she will not make or
publish, or cause to be made or published, any statement which is, or may
reasonably be considered to be, disparaging of the Company or its Affiliates,
or directors, officers or employees of the businesses of the Company or its
Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Section 17 shall preclude the Executive
from providing truthful testimony in response to a valid subpoena, court order,
regulatory request or as may be required by law.  

   18.     
Validity; Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
any Section or sub-Section of this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
any provision contained in Section 7 hereof, shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in
full force and effect. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable because of the scope, activity or duration of such provision, or
the area covered thereby, the parties hereto agree to modify such provision, or
that the court making such determination shall have the power to modify such
provision, to reduce the scope, activity, duration and/or area of such
provision, or to delete specific words or phrases therefrom, and in its reduced
or modified form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be
enforced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  

   19.      
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument.  

       20.      Settlement of
Disputes. All claims by the Executive for benefits under this Agreement shall
be directed to and determined by the Chief Executive Officer and shall be in
writing. Any denial by the Chief Executive Officer of a claim for benefits
under this Agreement shall be delivered to the Executive in writing and shall
set forth the specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon.  

  21.       
Trust.  The Company shall establish a trust with an independent trustee prior
to the occurrence of a Change in Control for the purpose of paying benefits
under this Agreement and other similar agreements maintained by the Company. 
The trust shall be a grantor trust subject to the claims of the Company's
creditors and shall, immediately prior to a Change in Control, be funded in
cash or such other assets as the Company deems appropriate with an amount equal
to 100 percent of the estimated benefits payable under this Agreement
(including without limitation the potential legal fees described in Section 15
hereof), which amount shall be determined after assuming that the Executive
incurred a termination of employment entitling him to Severance Payments
immediately following the Change in Control; provided, that, in the event that
such funding would result in the imposition of taxes or penalties under Section
409A of the Code with respect to the Executive, then this Section 21 shall cease
to apply.    

   IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first
above written.  

DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION  

By:

  Title:      

EXECUTIVE  

EXHIBIT A   

   RELEASE OF
CLAIMS   

  This RELEASE OF CLAIMS (the
 Release ) is executed and delivered by _____________ (the
 Employee ) to DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION (together with its Affiliates
and any successors thereto, the  Company ). The term  Company  in
this Release also includes any employee benefit plan established or maintained
by Duke Energy Corporation or any of its Affiliates, and any administrator,
trustee, fiduciary or service provider of any such plan).   

In consideration of the agreement by the Company to provide the Employee with
the rights, payments and benefits under the Change in Control Agreement between
the Employee and the Company dated _______________ (the  Severance Agreement ),
which the Employee acknowledges is consideration to which he or she would not
otherwise be entitled,  the Employee hereby agrees as follows:  

Section 1.     Release and Covenant   .  The
Employee, of his or her own free will, voluntarily and unconditionally releases
and forever discharges the Company, its subsidiaries, parents, affiliates,
their directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, successors and
assigns (both individually and in their official capacities with the Company)
(the  Company Releases ) from any and all past or present causes of
action, suits, agreements or other claims which the Employee, his or her
dependents, relatives, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns
has or may hereafter have from the beginning of time to the date hereof against
the Company or the Company Releases upon or by reason of any matter, cause or
thing whatsoever, including, but not limited to, any matters arising out of his
or her employment by the Company and the cessation of said employment, and
including, but not limited to, any alleged violation of the Civil Rights Acts
of 1964 and 1991, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990,
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and any other federal, state or
local law, regulation or ordinance, or public policy, contract or tort law
having any bearing whatsoever on the terms and conditions of employment or
termination of employment.  This Release shall not, however, constitute a
waiver of any of the Employee's rights under the Severance Agreement nor a
waiver of any claims that might arise after the date the Release is signed.

(the  Duke Releases ) from, any and all past or present causes of action,
suits, agreements or other claims which the Executive, his or her dependents,
relatives, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns has or may
hereafter have from the beginning of time to the date hereof against Duke
Energy or the Duke Releases upon or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever, including, but not limited to, any matters arising out of his or
her employment by the Affiliated Entities, and the cessation of said employment
or any claim for compensation, and including, but not limited to, any alleged

the North Carolina Equal Employment Protection Act and any other federal, state
or local law, regulation or ordinance, or public policy, contract or tort law
having any bearing whatsoever on the terms and conditions of employment or
termination of employment.  The Release shall not, however, constitute a waiver
of any of the Executive s rights to compensation and benefits due under this
Agreement.    

  b.       
The Executive acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of this Agreement
prior to its execution and has been advised hereby of his or her opportunity to
review and consider the Release for 21 days prior to its execution.  The
Executive further acknowledges that he or she has been advised hereby to
consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.  The Executive enters
into this Agreement having freely and knowingly elected, after due
consideration, to execute this Agreement and to fulfill the promises set forth
herein.  The Release shall be revocable by the Executive during the seven-day
period following its execution, and shall not become effective or enforceable
until the expiration of such seven-day period.  In the event of such a
revocation, the Executive shall not be entitled to the consideration under this
Agreement set forth in Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.    

  c.    
   The Executive represents and warrants that there has been no assignment or
other transfer of any interest in any claim which the Executive may have
against Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases. The Executive represents that
he or she has not commenced or joined in any claim, charge, action or
proceeding whatsoever against Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases arising
out of or relating to any of the matters set forth in this Release. The
Executive further agrees that he or she will not seek or be entitled to any
personal recovery in any claim, charge, action or proceeding whatsoever against
Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases for any of the matters set forth in the
Release.    

  d.       
The Executive acknowledges that, in his or her decision to enter into this
Agreement, including the Release, he or she has not relied on any
representations, promises or agreements of any kind, including oral statements
by representatives of Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases, except as set
forth in the Release and this Agreement.  

  e.       
Nothing contained in the Release will be deemed or construed as an admission of
wrongdoing or liability on the part of Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases.  

f.       
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit, restrict or otherwise
discourage the Executive from participating in protected activity as defined in
10 CFR 50.7 and Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974,
including, but not limited to reporting any suspected instance of illegal activity
of any nature, any nuclear safety concern, any workplace safety concern, any
public safety concern, or any other matter within the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's ( NRC ) regulatory responsibilities to the NRC,
the United States Department of Labor, or any other federal or state
governmental agency.  This Agreement further does not prohibit the
Executive from participating in any way in any state or federal administrative,
judicial, or legislative proceeding or investigation with respect to any claims
and matters not resolved and terminated pursuant to this Agreement. With
respect to any claims and matters resolved and terminated pursuant to this
Agreement, the Executive is free to participate in any federal or state
administrative, judicial, or legislative proceeding or investigation if
subpoenaed.  The Executive shall give Duke Energy, through its legal counsel,
notice, including a copy of the subpoena, within 24 hours of receipt
thereof.  

  6.                 
   Non-disparagement.      The Executive shall not disparage any of the
Affiliated Entities, their current or former directors, officers, employees,
agents, stockholders, successors and assigns (both individually and in their
official capacities with Duke Energy) (the  Duke Energy Parties ) or any Duke
Energy Parties  goods, services, employees, customers, business relationships,
reputation or financial condition.  Duke Energy shall instruct its current
officers and directors (as such terms are used for purposes of Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) not to disparage the Executive and shall
treat any such disparagement as a violation of Duke Energy s Code of Business
Ethics.  For purposes of this Agreement, to  disparage  means to make
statements, whether oral or written, whether direct or indirect, whether true
or false and whether acting alone or through any other person, that cast the
subject of the statement in a critical or unfavorable light or that otherwise
cause damage to, or intend to embarrass, the subject of the statement. 
Attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C is a press release regarding
Executive s termination of employment.  Neither the Executive nor Duke Energy
shall make any public statement regarding Executive s termination of employment
that is materially inconsistent with such press release.  The Executive and
Duke Energy each represent that the applicable party has not, since the
 Effective Time  under the Merger Agreement and through the Resignation Date,
directly made, or requested a third party to make, any statement to the press,
elected or governmental officials, Standard   Poor s, Moody s Investors
Services, Fitch Group or Duke Energy s regulators that would be a breach of
this Paragraph 6 had such statement been made on or after the Resignation Date. 
Nothing in the foregoing will preclude either the Executive or Duke Energy from
providing truthful disclosures as required by applicable law or legal process.  

  7.                
   Confidential Information; Restrictive Covenants.     

a.           Confidentiality; Covenant
not to Compete; Non-Interference.     The Executive shall be subject to each
of the covenants set forth in Section 8(g) (Covenant not to Compete), Section
8(h) (Non-Interference) and Section 8(i) (Confidential Information; Trade
Secrets) of the Employment Agreement.  In addition, unless otherwise made
public by Duke Energy, the Executive will not disclose the existence and any
terms of this Agreement except (i) to financial and legal advisors or spouse
(or domestic partner) under an obligation for such parties to maintain
confidentiality, or (ii) as required by a valid court order, subpoena or legal,
regulatory, or legislative process (and in such event will use his or her best
efforts to obtain a protective order requiring that all disclosures be kept under
court seal) and will notify the Duke Energy promptly upon receipt of such order
or subpoena.     

  b.       
   Forfeiture and Repayments.    The Executive agrees that, in the event he or
she violates the provisions of Paragraph 6 or Paragraph 7 of this Agreement, in
any material respect, he or she will forfeit and not be entitled to any further
payments in accordance with Paragraph 2 or Paragraph 4 of this Agreement or
settlement in accordance with Paragraph 3 and he or she will be obligated to
repay to Duke Energy any amounts paid (determined as of the date of payment)
after the termination of employment pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Paragraph 2, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 4 of this Agreement (other than any
amounts paid pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) [and Paragraph 2(d)] of this
Agreement).  Such amount shall be paid to Duke Energy in cash in a single
lump sum within ten business days after the first date of the violation,
whether or not Duke Energy has knowledge of the violation or has made a demand
for payment.  Any such payment made following such date shall bear interest at
a rate equal to the prime lending rate of Citibank, N.A. (as periodically set)
plus 1%.  

  c.       
   Scope of Restrictions; Consideration.     The Executive acknowledges
that the restrictions set forth in this Paragraph 7 are reasonable and
necessary to protect Duke Energy s business and goodwill. The Executive
acknowledges that if any of these restrictions or obligations are found by a
court having jurisdiction to be unreasonable or overly broad or otherwise
unenforceable, he or she and Duke Energy agree that the restrictions or
obligations shall be modified by the court so as to be reasonable and
enforceable and if so modified shall be fully enforced.  The Executive
acknowledges and agrees that the compensation and benefits provided in this
Agreement constitute adequate and sufficient consideration for the covenants
made by the Executive in this Paragraph 7.  As further consideration for the
covenants made by the Executive in this Paragraph 7, the Affiliated Entities
have provided the Executive certain proprietary and other confidential
information about Duke Energy, including, but not limited to, business plans
and strategies, budgets and budgetary projections, income and earnings projections
and statements, cost analyses and assessments, and/or business assessments of
legal and regulatory issues.  

  8.                  
   Cooperation.      The Executive agrees to cooperate with Duke Energy in
connection with his or her departure as reasonably requested by Duke Energy,
including with respect to any communications to current and former employees or
directors of any of the Affiliated Entities as may reasonably be requested by
Duke Energy in connection with such departure.  The Executive will be available,
upon reasonable notice, to respond to questions and provide assistance to Duke
Energy regarding matters for which he or she was responsible and about which he
or she had knowledge in connection with his or her employment with any of the
Affiliated Entities.  The Executive also will cooperate in any potential or
pending litigation or arbitration that may involve him or her in any capacity
as a result of his or her employment with, or service as a member of the board
of directors of, any of the Affiliated Entities.  This includes, if necessary,
meeting at mutually convenient times with attorneys of any of the Affiliated
Entities, attending meetings, depositions and trial, and providing truthful
testimony.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Paragraph 8, in no event will
the Executive be required, without mutually acceptable additional compensation,
to provide services under this Paragraph 8 (i) that exceed 10 hours in any
calendar month and/or (ii) after the first anniversary of the Resignation
Date.    

  9.                   
   Governing Law and Forum Selection.     The Parties agree that any dispute,
claim or controversy based on common law, equity, or any federal, state, or
local statute, ordinance, or regulation (other than workers  compensation
claims) arising out of or relating in any way to the Executive s employment,
the terms, benefits, and conditions of employment, or concerning this Agreement
and the resulting termination of employment, including whether such a dispute
is arbitrable, shall be settled by arbitration. The arbitration proceeding will
be conducted under the employment dispute resolution arbitration rules of the
American Arbitration Association in effect at the time a demand for arbitration
under the rules is made, and such proceeding will be adjudicated in Charlotte,
North Carolina. The decision of the arbitrator(s), including determination of
the amount of any damages suffered, will be exclusive, final, and binding on
all Parties, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
Each Party will bear its own expenses in the arbitration for arbitrators  fees
and attorneys  fees, for its witnesses, and for other expenses of presenting
its case. Other arbitration costs, including administrative fees and fees for
records or transcripts, will be borne equally by the Parties.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Paragraph 9 to the contrary, if the Executive prevails
with respect to any dispute submitted to arbitration under this Paragraph 9,
Duke Energy will reimburse or pay all legal fees and expenses that the
Executive may reasonably incur as a result of the dispute.    

  10.                   
   Applicable Law.     Except to the extent that federal law governs, this
Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the
laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to any applicable state s
choice of law provisions.    

  11.                    
   Integrated Agreement; Amendments.     Except with respect to the provisions
of the CIC Plan and the Employment Agreement expressly referenced herein, this
Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of Duke Energy and the Executive with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all other agreements
between any of the Affiliated Entities and the Executive and any employment or
severance plan, policy, agreement or arrangement of any of the Affiliated
Entities.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive
expressly acknowledges and agrees that except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, he or she is not entitled to receive any severance pay, severance
benefits, compensation or employee benefits of any kind whatsoever from Duke
Energy or any of its affiliates.  This Agreement may not be amended unless the
amendments are in writing and signed by the Executive and an authorized
representative of Duke Energy.  

  12.                     
   Severability.      The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular
provision in this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions hereof, and
this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if the invalid or
unenforceable provision were omitted.  

  13.                     
   Taxes.      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Duke
Energy may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement, or any other
benefits received pursuant hereto, such Federal, state and/or local taxes as
shall be required to be withheld under any applicable law or regulation.  The
obligations under this Agreement are intended to comply with the requirements
of Section 409A of the   

Code, or an exemption or
exclusion therefrom, provided that the Executive acknowledges and agrees that
he or she shall be solely responsible for any taxes and/or penalties imposed
under Section 409A of the Code.  Each payment under this Agreement shall be treated
as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  In no event
may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any
payment to be made under this Agreement.  If the Executive is a  specified
employee  (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) then any payments
that are required to be made to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement that
constitute the deferral of compensation (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b) and that would in the absence of this Paragraph
13 have been paid to the Executive within six months and one day of the
Resignation Date shall not be paid to the Executive during such period, but
shall instead be accumulated and paid to the Executive in a lump sum on the earlier
of (i) the day after the date that is six months from the Resignation Date
and (ii) if the Executive shall die prior to the expiration of such six-month
period, as soon as practicable following the date of the Executive s death. 
All reimbursements and in-kind benefits that constitute deferred compensation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code provided under this Agreement
shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code, including, without limitation, that (i) in no event shall
reimbursements by Duke Energy under this Agreement be made later than the end
of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable
fees and expenses were incurred; (ii) the amount of in-kind benefits that Duke
Energy is obligated to pay or provide in any given calendar year shall not
affect the in-kind benefits that Duke Energy is obligated to pay or provide in
any other calendar year; and (iii) the Executive s right to have Duke Energy
pay or provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated
or exchanged for any other benefit.    

  14.                       
   Successors.      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the
prior written consent of Duke Energy shall not be assignable by the Executive
other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive s legal
representatives and the legal representatives of his or her estate to the
extent applicable.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon Duke Energy and its successors and assigns.  

  15.                         
   Counterparts.      This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which is deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
constitute one and the same agreement.  

  16.                         
   Representations and Warranties.     By signing this Agreement, the
Executive warrants that he or she:

resigned, effective immediately.   

Jim Rogers, chairman,
president and chief executive officer of Duke Energy,

together to capitalize on the significant opportunities we now have as one
company. While we encouraged the entire team to maintain their roles, John,
Mark and Paula requested to step down and we wish them well.  

We are grateful
to be able to draw from the deep bench of executives from both Progress Energy
and Duke Energy and have already begun working to identify the best way to
fulfill the responsibilities held by John, Mark and Paula. We look forward to
executing on our strategy as one company and one team committed to offering
significant benefits for customers, shareholders and the communities we serve, 
Rogers said.  

The company also
noted that its integration efforts are on track. More than 50 integration teams
made up of representatives from both Duke Energy and Progress Energy have been
working diligently to execute on the integration at the functional level.

suits, agreements or other claims which the Executive, his or her dependents,
relatives, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns has or may
hereafter have from the beginning of time to the date hereof against Duke

or any claim for compensation, and including, but not limited to, any alleged
violation of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991, the Equal Pay Act of 1963,
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Older Workers

the North Carolina Equal Employment Protection Act and any other federal, state
or local law, regulation or ordinance, or public policy, contract or tort law
having any bearing whatsoever on the terms and conditions of employment or
termination of employment.  The Release shall not, however, constitute a waiver
of any of the Executive s rights to compensation and benefits due under this
Agreement.    

  b.       
The Executive acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of this Agreement
prior to its execution and has been advised hereby of his or her opportunity to
review and consider the Release for 21 days prior to its execution.  The
Executive further acknowledges that he or she has been advised hereby to
consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.  The Executive enters
into this Agreement having freely and knowingly elected, after due
consideration, to execute this Agreement and to fulfill the promises set forth
herein.  The Release shall be revocable by the Executive during the seven-day
period following its execution, and shall not become effective or enforceable
until the expiration of such seven-day period.  In the event of such a
revocation, the Executive shall not be entitled to the consideration under this
Agreement set forth in Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.    

  c.    
   The Executive represents and warrants that there has been no assignment or
other transfer of any interest in any claim which the Executive may have
against Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases. The Executive represents that
he or she has not commenced or joined in any claim, charge, action or
proceeding whatsoever against Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases arising
out of or relating to any of the matters set forth in this Release. The
Executive further agrees that he or she will not seek or be entitled to any
personal recovery in any claim, charge, action or proceeding whatsoever against
Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases for any of the matters set forth in the
Release.    

  d.       
The Executive acknowledges that, in his or her decision to enter into this
Agreement, including the Release, he or she has not relied on any
representations, promises or agreements of any kind, including oral statements
by representatives of Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases, except as set
forth in the Release and this Agreement.  

  e.       
Nothing contained in the Release will be deemed or construed as an admission of
wrongdoing or liability on the part of Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases.  

f.       
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit, restrict or otherwise
discourage the Executive from participating in protected activity as defined in
10 CFR 50.7 and Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974,
including, but not limited to reporting any suspected instance of illegal activity
of any nature, any nuclear safety concern, any workplace safety concern, any
public safety concern, or any other matter within the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's ( NRC ) regulatory responsibilities to the NRC,
the United States Department of Labor, or any other federal or state
governmental agency.  This Agreement further does not prohibit the
Executive from participating in any way in any state or federal administrative,
judicial, or legislative proceeding or investigation with respect to any claims
and matters not resolved and terminated pursuant to this Agreement. With
respect to any claims and matters resolved and terminated pursuant to this
Agreement, the Executive is free to participate in any federal or state
administrative, judicial, or legislative proceeding or investigation if
subpoenaed.  The Executive shall give Duke Energy, through its legal counsel,
notice, including a copy of the subpoena, within 24 hours of receipt
thereof.  

  6.                 
   Non-disparagement.      The Executive shall not disparage any of the
Affiliated Entities, their current or former directors, officers, employees,
agents, stockholders, successors and assigns (both individually and in their
official capacities with Duke Energy) (the  Duke Energy Parties ) or any Duke
Energy Parties  goods, services, employees, customers, business relationships,
reputation or financial condition.  Duke Energy shall instruct its current
officers and directors (as such terms are used for purposes of Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) not to disparage the Executive and shall
treat any such disparagement as a violation of Duke Energy s Code of Business
Ethics.  For purposes of this Agreement, to  disparage  means to make
statements, whether oral or written, whether direct or indirect, whether true
or false and whether acting alone or through any other person, that cast the
subject of the statement in a critical or unfavorable light or that otherwise
cause damage to, or intend to embarrass, the subject of the statement. 
Attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C is a press release regarding
Executive s termination of employment.  Neither the Executive nor Duke Energy
shall make any public statement regarding Executive s termination of employment
that is materially inconsistent with such press release.  The Executive and
Duke Energy each represent that the applicable party has not, since the
 Effective Time  under the Merger Agreement and through the Resignation Date,
directly made, or requested a third party to make, any statement to the press,
elected or governmental officials, Standard   Poor s, Moody s Investors
Services, Fitch Group or Duke Energy s regulators that would be a breach of
this Paragraph 6 had such statement been made on or after the Resignation Date. 
Nothing in the foregoing will preclude either the Executive or Duke Energy from
providing truthful disclosures as required by applicable law or legal process.  

  7.                
   Confidential Information; Restrictive Covenants.     

a.           Confidentiality; Covenant
not to Compete; Non-Interference.     The Executive shall be subject to each
of the covenants set forth in Section 8(g) (Covenant not to Compete), Section
8(h) (Non-Interference) and Section 8(i) (Confidential Information; Trade
Secrets) of the Employment Agreement.  In addition, unless otherwise made
public by Duke Energy, the Executive will not disclose the existence and any
terms of this Agreement except (i) to financial and legal advisors or spouse
(or domestic partner) under an obligation for such parties to maintain
confidentiality, or (ii) as required by a valid court order, subpoena or legal,
regulatory, or legislative process (and in such event will use his or her best
efforts to obtain a protective order requiring that all disclosures be kept under
court seal) and will notify the Duke Energy promptly upon receipt of such order
or subpoena.     

  b.       
   Forfeiture and Repayments.    The Executive agrees that, in the event he or
she violates the provisions of Paragraph 6 or Paragraph 7 of this Agreement, in
any material respect, he or she will forfeit and not be entitled to any further
payments in accordance with Paragraph 2 or Paragraph 4 of this Agreement or
settlement in accordance with Paragraph 3 and he or she will be obligated to
repay to Duke Energy any amounts paid (determined as of the date of payment)
after the termination of employment pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Paragraph 2, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 4 of this Agreement (other than any
amounts paid pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) [and Paragraph 2(d)] of this
Agreement).  Such amount shall be paid to Duke Energy in cash in a single
lump sum within ten business days after the first date of the violation,
whether or not Duke Energy has knowledge of the violation or has made a demand
for payment.  Any such payment made following such date shall bear interest at
a rate equal to the prime lending rate of Citibank, N.A. (as periodically set)
plus 1%.  

  c.       
   Scope of Restrictions; Consideration.     The Executive acknowledges
that the restrictions set forth in this Paragraph 7 are reasonable and
necessary to protect Duke Energy s business and goodwill. The Executive
acknowledges that if any of these restrictions or obligations are found by a
court having jurisdiction to be unreasonable or overly broad or otherwise
unenforceable, he or she and Duke Energy agree that the restrictions or
obligations shall be modified by the court so as to be reasonable and
enforceable and if so modified shall be fully enforced.  The Executive
acknowledges and agrees that the compensation and benefits provided in this
Agreement constitute adequate and sufficient consideration for the covenants
made by the Executive in this Paragraph 7.  As further consideration for the
covenants made by the Executive in this Paragraph 7, the Affiliated Entities
have provided the Executive certain proprietary and other confidential
information about Duke Energy, including, but not limited to, business plans
and strategies, budgets and budgetary projections, income and earnings projections
and statements, cost analyses and assessments, and/or business assessments of
legal and regulatory issues.  

  8.                  
   Cooperation.      The Executive agrees to cooperate with Duke Energy in
connection with his or her departure as reasonably requested by Duke Energy,
including with respect to any communications to current and former employees or
directors of any of the Affiliated Entities as may reasonably be requested by
Duke Energy in connection with such departure.  The Executive will be available,
upon reasonable notice, to respond to questions and provide assistance to Duke
Energy regarding matters for which he or she was responsible and about which he
or she had knowledge in connection with his or her employment with any of the
Affiliated Entities.  The Executive also will cooperate in any potential or
pending litigation or arbitration that may involve him or her in any capacity
as a result of his or her employment with, or service as a member of the board
of directors of, any of the Affiliated Entities.  This includes, if necessary,
meeting at mutually convenient times with attorneys of any of the Affiliated
Entities, attending meetings, depositions and trial, and providing truthful
testimony.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Paragraph 8, in no event will
the Executive be required, without mutually acceptable additional compensation,
to provide services under this Paragraph 8 (i) that exceed 10 hours in any
calendar month and/or (ii) after the first anniversary of the Resignation
Date.    

  9.                   
   Governing Law and Forum Selection.     The Parties agree that any dispute,
claim or controversy based on common law, equity, or any federal, state, or
local statute, ordinance, or regulation (other than workers  compensation
claims) arising out of or relating in any way to the Executive s employment,
the terms, benefits, and conditions of employment, or concerning this Agreement
and the resulting termination of employment, including whether such a dispute
is arbitrable, shall be settled by arbitration. The arbitration proceeding will
be conducted under the employment dispute resolution arbitration rules of the
American Arbitration Association in effect at the time a demand for arbitration
under the rules is made, and such proceeding will be adjudicated in Charlotte,
North Carolina. The decision of the arbitrator(s), including determination of
the amount of any damages suffered, will be exclusive, final, and binding on
all Parties, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
Each Party will bear its own expenses in the arbitration for arbitrators  fees
and attorneys  fees, for its witnesses, and for other expenses of presenting
its case. Other arbitration costs, including administrative fees and fees for
records or transcripts, will be borne equally by the Parties.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Paragraph 9 to the contrary, if the Executive prevails
with respect to any dispute submitted to arbitration under this Paragraph 9,
Duke Energy will reimburse or pay all legal fees and expenses that the
Executive may reasonably incur as a result of the dispute.    

  10.                   
   Applicable Law.     Except to the extent that federal law governs, this
Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the
laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to any applicable state s
choice of law provisions.    

  11.                    
   Integrated Agreement; Amendments.     Except with respect to the provisions
of the CIC Plan and the Employment Agreement expressly referenced herein, this
Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of Duke Energy and the Executive with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all other agreements
between any of the Affiliated Entities and the Executive and any employment or
severance plan, policy, agreement or arrangement of any of the Affiliated
Entities.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive
expressly acknowledges and agrees that except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, he or she is not entitled to receive any severance pay, severance
benefits, compensation or employee benefits of any kind whatsoever from Duke
Energy or any of its affiliates.  This Agreement may not be amended unless the
amendments are in writing and signed by the Executive and an authorized
representative of Duke Energy.  

  12.                     
   Severability.      The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular
provision in this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions hereof, and
this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if the invalid or
unenforceable provision were omitted.  

  13.                     
   Taxes.      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Duke
Energy may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement, or any other
benefits received pursuant hereto, such Federal, state and/or local taxes as
shall be required to be withheld under any applicable law or regulation.  The
obligations under this Agreement are intended to comply with the requirements
of Section 409A of the   

Code, or an exemption or
exclusion therefrom, provided that the Executive acknowledges and agrees that
he or she shall be solely responsible for any taxes and/or penalties imposed
under Section 409A of the Code.  Each payment under this Agreement shall be treated
as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  In no event
may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any
payment to be made under this Agreement.  If the Executive is a  specified
employee  (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) then any payments
that are required to be made to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement that
constitute the deferral of compensation (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b) and that would in the absence of this Paragraph
13 have been paid to the Executive within six months and one day of the
Resignation Date shall not be paid to the Executive during such period, but
shall instead be accumulated and paid to the Executive in a lump sum on the earlier
of (i) the day after the date that is six months from the Resignation Date
and (ii) if the Executive shall die prior to the expiration of such six-month
period, as soon as practicable following the date of the Executive s death. 
All reimbursements and in-kind benefits that constitute deferred compensation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code provided under this Agreement
shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code, including, without limitation, that (i) in no event shall
reimbursements by Duke Energy under this Agreement be made later than the end
of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable
fees and expenses were incurred; (ii) the amount of in-kind benefits that Duke
Energy is obligated to pay or provide in any given calendar year shall not
affect the in-kind benefits that Duke Energy is obligated to pay or provide in
any other calendar year; and (iii) the Executive s right to have Duke Energy
pay or provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated
or exchanged for any other benefit.    

  14.                       
   Successors.      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the
prior written consent of Duke Energy shall not be assignable by the Executive
other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive s legal
representatives and the legal representatives of his or her estate to the
extent applicable.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon Duke Energy and its successors and assigns.  

  15.                         
   Counterparts.      This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which is deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
constitute one and the same agreement.  

  16.                         
   Representations and Warranties.     By signing this Agreement, the
Executive warrants that he or she:

consideration, to execute this Agreement and to fulfill the promises set forth

period following its execution, and shall not become effective or enforceable
until the expiration of such seven-day period.  In the event of such a
revocation, the Executive shall not be entitled to the consideration under this
Agreement set forth in Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.    

  c.       
The Executive represents and warrants that there has been no assignment or
other transfer of any interest in any claim which the Executive may have
against Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases. The Executive represents that
he or she has not commenced or joined in any claim, charge, action or
proceeding whatsoever against Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases arising
out of or relating to any of the matters set forth in this Release. The
Executive further agrees that he or she will not seek or be entitled to any
personal recovery in any claim, charge, action or proceeding whatsoever against
Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases for any of the matters set forth in the
Release.    

  d.       
The Executive acknowledges that, in his or her decision to enter into this
Agreement, including the Release, he or she has not relied on any representations,
promises or agreements of any kind, including oral statements by
representatives of Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases, except as set forth
in the Release and this Agreement.  

  e.       
Nothing contained in the Release will be deemed or construed as an admission of
wrongdoing or liability on the part of Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases.  

f.       
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit, restrict or otherwise
discourage the Executive from participating in protected activity as defined in
10 CFR 50.7 and Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974,
including, but not limited to reporting any suspected instance of illegal
activity of any nature, any nuclear safety concern, any workplace safety
concern, any public safety concern, or any other matter within the United
States Nuclear Regulatory Commission's ( NRC ) regulatory responsibilities
to the NRC, the United States Department of Labor, or any other federal or
state governmental agency.  This Agreement further does not prohibit the
Executive from participating in any way in any state or federal administrative,
judicial, or legislative proceeding or investigation with respect to any claims
and matters not resolved and terminated pursuant to this Agreement. With respect
to any claims and matters resolved and terminated pursuant to this Agreement,
the Executive is free to participate in any federal or state administrative,
judicial, or legislative proceeding or investigation if subpoenaed.  The
Executive shall give Duke Energy, through its legal counsel, notice, including
a copy of the subpoena, within 24 hours of receipt thereof.  

  6.                 
   Non-disparagement.      The Executive shall not disparage any of the
Affiliated Entities, their current or former directors, officers, employees,
agents, stockholders, successors and assigns (both individually and in their
official capacities with Duke Energy) (the  Duke Energy Parties ) or any Duke
Energy Parties  goods, services, employees, customers, business relationships, reputation
or financial condition.  Duke Energy shall instruct its current officers and
directors (as such terms are used for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) not to disparage the Executive and shall treat any such
disparagement as a violation of Duke Energy s Code of Business Ethics.  For
purposes of this Agreement, to  disparage  means to make statements, whether
oral or written, whether direct or indirect, whether true or false and whether
acting alone or through any other person, that cast the subject of the
statement in a critical or unfavorable light or that otherwise cause damage to,
or intend to embarrass, the subject of the statement.  Attached to this
Agreement as Exhibit C is a press release regarding Executive s termination of
employment.  Neither the Executive nor Duke Energy shall make any public
statement regarding Executive s termination of employment that is materially
inconsistent with such press release.  The Executive and Duke Energy each
represent that the applicable party has not, since the  Effective Time  under
the Merger Agreement and through the Resignation Date, directly made, or
requested a third party to make, any statement to the press, elected or
governmental officials, Standard   Poor s, Moody s Investors Services,
Fitch Group or Duke Energy s regulators that would be a breach of this
Paragraph 6 had such statement been made on or after the Resignation Date. 
Nothing in the foregoing will preclude either the Executive or Duke Energy from
providing truthful disclosures as required by applicable law or legal process.  

  7.                
   Confidential Information; Restrictive Covenants.     

a.           Confidentiality; Covenant
not to Compete; Non-Interference.     The Executive shall be subject to each
of the covenants set forth in Section 8(g) (Covenant not to Compete), Section
8(h) (Non-Interference) and Section 8(i) (Confidential Information; Trade
Secrets) of the Employment Agreement.  In addition, unless otherwise made
public by Duke Energy, the Executive will not disclose the existence and any
terms of this Agreement except (i) to financial and legal advisors or spouse
(or domestic partner) under an obligation for such parties to maintain
confidentiality, or (ii) as required by a valid court order, subpoena or legal,
regulatory, or legislative process (and in such event will use his or her best
efforts to obtain a protective order requiring that all disclosures be kept
under court seal) and will notify the Duke Energy promptly upon receipt of such
order or subpoena.     

  b.       
   Forfeiture and Repayments.    The Executive agrees that, in the event he or
she violates the provisions of Paragraph 6 or Paragraph 7 of this Agreement, in
any material respect, he or she will forfeit and not be entitled to any further
payments in accordance with Paragraph 2 or Paragraph 4 of this Agreement or
settlement in accordance with Paragraph 3 and he or she will be obligated to
repay to Duke Energy any amounts paid (determined as of the date of payment)
after the termination of employment pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Paragraph 2, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 4 of this Agreement (other than any
amounts paid pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) [and Paragraph 2(d)] of this
Agreement).  Such amount shall be paid to Duke Energy in cash in a single
lump sum within ten business days after the first date of the violation,
whether or not Duke Energy has knowledge of the violation or has made a demand
for payment.  Any such payment made following such date shall bear interest at
a rate equal to the prime lending rate of Citibank, N.A. (as periodically set)
plus 1%.  

  c.       
   Scope of Restrictions; Consideration.     The Executive acknowledges
that the restrictions set forth in this Paragraph 7 are reasonable and
necessary to protect Duke Energy s business and goodwill. The Executive
acknowledges that if any of these restrictions or obligations are found by a
court having jurisdiction to be unreasonable or overly broad or otherwise
unenforceable, he or she and Duke Energy agree that the restrictions or
obligations shall be modified by the court so as to be reasonable and
enforceable and if so modified shall be fully enforced.  The Executive
acknowledges and agrees that the compensation and benefits provided in this
Agreement constitute adequate and sufficient consideration for the covenants
made by the Executive in this Paragraph 7.  As further consideration for the
covenants made by the Executive in this Paragraph 7, the Affiliated Entities
have provided the Executive certain proprietary and other confidential
information about Duke Energy, including, but not limited to, business plans
and strategies, budgets and budgetary projections, income and earnings
projections and statements, cost analyses and assessments, and/or business
assessments of legal and regulatory issues.  

  8.                  
   Cooperation.      The Executive agrees to cooperate with Duke Energy in
connection with his or her departure as reasonably requested by Duke Energy,
including with respect to any communications to current and former employees or
directors of any of the Affiliated Entities as may reasonably be requested by
Duke Energy in connection with such departure.  The Executive will be
available, upon reasonable notice, to respond to questions and provide
assistance to Duke Energy regarding matters for which he or she was responsible
and about which he or she had knowledge in connection with his or her
employment with any of the Affiliated Entities.  The Executive also will
cooperate in any potential or pending litigation or arbitration that may
involve him or her in any capacity as a result of his or her employment with,
or service as a member of the board of directors of, any of the Affiliated
Entities.  This includes, if necessary, meeting at mutually convenient times
with attorneys of any of the Affiliated Entities, attending meetings,
depositions and trial, and providing truthful testimony.  Notwithstanding any
provision of this Paragraph 8, in no event will the Executive be required,
without mutually acceptable additional compensation, to provide services under
this Paragraph 8 (i) that exceed 10 hours in any calendar month and/or (ii)
after the first anniversary of the Resignation Date.    

  9.                   
   Governing Law and Forum Selection.     The Parties agree that any dispute,
claim or controversy based on common law, equity, or any federal, state, or
local statute, ordinance, or regulation (other than workers  compensation
claims) arising out of or relating in any way to the Executive s employment,
the terms, benefits, and conditions of employment, or concerning this Agreement
and the resulting termination of employment, including whether such a dispute
is arbitrable, shall be settled by arbitration. The arbitration proceeding will
be conducted under the employment dispute resolution arbitration rules of the
American Arbitration Association in effect at the time a demand for arbitration
under the rules is made, and such proceeding will be adjudicated in Charlotte,
North Carolina. The decision of the arbitrator(s), including determination of
the amount of any damages suffered, will be exclusive, final, and binding on
all Parties, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
Each Party will bear its own expenses in the arbitration for arbitrators  fees
and attorneys  fees, for its witnesses, and for other expenses of presenting
its case. Other arbitration costs, including administrative fees and fees for
records or transcripts, will be borne equally by the Parties.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Paragraph 9 to the contrary, if the Executive prevails
with respect to any dispute submitted to arbitration under this Paragraph 9,
Duke Energy will reimburse or pay all legal fees and expenses that the
Executive may reasonably incur as a result of the dispute.    

  10.                       Applicable
Law.     Except to the extent that federal law governs, this Agreement will be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State
of North Carolina, without regard to any applicable state s choice of law
provisions.    

  11.                    
   Integrated Agreement; Amendments.     Except with respect to the provisions
of the CIC Plan and the Employment Agreement expressly referenced herein, this
Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of Duke Energy and the Executive with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all other agreements
between any of the Affiliated Entities and the Executive and any employment or
severance plan, policy, agreement or arrangement of any of the Affiliated
Entities.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive
expressly acknowledges and agrees that except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, he or she is not entitled to receive any severance pay, severance
benefits, compensation or employee benefits of any kind whatsoever from Duke
Energy or any of its affiliates.  This Agreement may not be amended unless the
amendments are in writing and signed by the Executive and an authorized
representative of Duke Energy.  

  12.                     
   Severability.      The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular
provision in this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions hereof, and
this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if the invalid or
unenforceable provision were omitted.  

  13.                         Taxes.     
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Duke Energy may withhold
from any amounts payable under this Agreement, or any other benefits received
pursuant hereto, such Federal, state and/or local taxes as shall be required to
be withheld under any applicable law or regulation.  The obligations under this
Agreement are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the   

Code, or an exemption or exclusion therefrom, provided
that the Executive acknowledges and agrees that he or she shall be solely
responsible for any taxes and/or penalties imposed under Section 409A of the
Code.  Each payment under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment
for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  In no event may the Executive,
directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made
under this Agreement.  If the Executive is a  specified employee  (within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code) then any payments that are required to be
made to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement that constitute the deferral
of compensation (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)
and that would in the absence of this Paragraph 13 have been paid to the
Executive within six months and one day of the Resignation Date shall not be
paid to the Executive during such period, but shall instead be accumulated and
paid to the Executive in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the day after
the date that is six months from the Resignation Date and (ii) if the Executive
shall die prior to the expiration of such six-month period, as soon as
practicable following the date of the Executive s death.  All reimbursements
and in-kind benefits that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code provided under this Agreement shall be made or
provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code,
including, without limitation, that (i) in no event shall reimbursements by
Duke Energy under this Agreement be made later than the end of the calendar
year next following the calendar year in which the applicable fees and expenses
were incurred; (ii) the amount of in-kind benefits that Duke Energy is
obligated to pay or provide in any given calendar year shall not affect the
in-kind benefits that Duke Energy is obligated to pay or provide in any other
calendar year; and (iii) the Executive s right to have Duke Energy pay or
provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or
exchanged for any other benefit.    

  14.                       
   Successors.      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the
prior written consent of Duke Energy shall not be assignable by the Executive
other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive s legal
representatives and the legal representatives of his or her estate to the
extent applicable.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon Duke Energy and its successors and assigns.  

  15.                         
   Counterparts.      This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which is deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
constitute one and the same agreement.  

  16.         
                   Representations and Warranties.     By signing this
Agreement, the Executive warrants that he or she:

We are grateful
to be able to draw from the deep bench of executives from both Progress Energy

fulfill the responsibilities held by John, Mark and Paula. We look forward to
executing on our strategy as one company and one team committed to offering
significant benefits for customers, shareholders and the communities we serve, 
Rogers said.

Agreement.  The Executive enters into this Agreement having freely and
knowingly elected, after due consideration, to execute this Agreement and to

Executive further agrees that he will not seek or be entitled to any personal
recovery in any claim, charge, action or proceeding whatsoever against Duke
Energy or any of the Duke Releases for any of the matters set forth in the
Release.    

  d.        The Executive acknowledges that, in
his decision to enter into this Agreement, including the Release, he has not
relied on any representations, promises or agreements of any kind, including
oral statements by representatives of Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases,
except as set forth in the Release and this Agreement.  

  e.        Nothing contained in the Release
will be deemed or construed as an admission of wrongdoing or liability on the
part of Duke Energy or any of the Duke Releases.     

  f.         Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to prohibit, restrict or otherwise discourage the Executive from
participating in protected activity as defined in 10 CFR 50.7 and Section 211
of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, including, but not limited to
reporting any suspected instance of illegal activity of any nature, any nuclear
safety concern, any workplace safety concern, any public safety concern, or any
other matter within the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission s
( NRC )regulatory responsibilities to the NRC, the United States Department of
Labor, or any other federal or state governmental agency.  This Agreement

Executive shall not disparage any of the Affiliated Entities, their directors,
officers, employees, agents, stockholders, successors and assigns (both
individually and in their official capacities with Duke Energy) (the  Duke
Energy Parties ) or any Duke Energy Parties  goods, services, employees,
customers, business relationships, reputation or financial condition.  Duke
Energy shall instruct its current officers and directors (as such terms are
used for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) not to
disparage the Executive and shall treat any such disparagement as a violation
of Duke Energy s Code of Business Ethics.  For purposes of this Agreement, to
 disparage  means to make statements, whether oral or written, whether direct or
indirect, whether true or false and whether acting alone or through any other
person, that cast the subject of the statement in a critical or unfavorable
light or that otherwise cause damage to, or intend to embarrass, the subject of
the statement.  Nothing in the foregoing will preclude either the Executive or
Duke Energy from providing truthful disclosures as required by applicable law
or legal process.   

8.               
   Confidential Information; Restrictive Covenants; Return of Property   .     

  a.           Confidentiality; Covenant not to
Compete; Non-Interference   .  The Executive shall be subject to each of the
covenants set forth in Section 8(g) (Covenant not to Compete), Section 8(h)
(Non-Interference) and Section 8(i) (Confidential Information; Trade Secrets)
of the Employment Agreement.  In addition, unless otherwise made public by Duke
Energy, the Executive will not disclose the existence and any terms of this
Agreement except (i) to financial and legal advisors or spouse (or domestic
partner) under an obligation for such parties to maintain confidentiality, or
(ii) as required by a valid court order, subpoena or legal, regulatory, or
legislative process (and in such event will use his best efforts to obtain a
protective order requiring that all disclosures be kept under court seal) and
will notify Duke Energy promptly upon receipt of such order or subpoena.     

  b.            Forfeiture and
Repayments. The Executive agrees that, in the event he violates the provisions
of Paragraph 6 or Paragraph 7 of this Agreement, in any material respect, on or
following the Resignation Date, he will forfeit and not be entitled to any
further payments in accordance with Paragraph 2 or Paragraph 4 of this
Agreement or settlement in accordance with Paragraph 3 and he will be obligated
to repay to Duke Energy any amounts paid (determined as of the date of payment)
after the termination of employment pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Paragraph 2, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 4 of this Agreement (other than any
amounts paid pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) and Paragraph 2(e) of this
Agreement).  Such amount shall be paid to Duke Energy in cash in a single
lump sum within ten business days after the first date of the violation,
whether or not Duke Energy has knowledge of the violation or has made a demand
for payment.  Any such payment made following such date shall bear interest at
a rate equal to the prime lending rate of Citibank, N.A. (as periodically set)
plus 1%.  

  c.        Scope of Restrictions;
Consideration.  The Executive acknowledges that the restrictions set forth
in this Paragraph 7 are reasonable and necessary to protect Duke Energy s
business and goodwill. The Executive acknowledges that if any of these
restrictions or obligations are found by a court having jurisdiction to be
unreasonable or overly broad or otherwise unenforceable, he and Duke Energy
agree that the restrictions or obligations shall be modified by the court so as
to be reasonable and enforceable and if so modified shall be fully enforced.      The
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the compensation and benefits provided
in this Agreement constitute adequate and sufficient consideration for the
covenants made by the Executive in this Paragraph 7.  As further consideration
for the covenants made by the Executive in this Paragraph 7, the Affiliated
Entities have provided the Executive certain proprietary and other confidential
information about Duke Energy, including, but not limited to, business plans
and strategies, budgets and budgetary projections, income and earnings
projections and statements, cost analyses and assessments, and/or business
assessments of legal and regulatory issues.  

  d.           Return of Property   .  The
Executive acknowledges and agrees that all  Company Materials , which include,
but are not limited to, computers, blackberry, computer software, computer
disks, tapes, printouts, source, HTML and other code, flowcharts, schematics,
designs, graphics, drawings, photographs, charts, graphs, notebooks, customer

and all other documents whether printed, typewritten, handwritten, electronic,
or stored on computer disks, tapes, hard drives, or any other tangible medium,
as well as samples, prototypes, models, products and the like, shall be the
exclusive property of Duke Energy and, as of the Resignation Date, all Company
Materials, including all copies thereof, as well as all other property of Duke
Energy then in the Employee s possession or control, shall be returned to Duke Energy.  

  9.                     Cooperation   . 
The Executive agrees to cooperate with Duke Energy in connection with his
departure as reasonably requested by Duke Energy, including with respect to any
communications to current and former employees or directors of any of the
Affiliated Entities as may reasonably be requested by Duke Energy in connection
with such departure.  The Executive will be available, upon reasonable notice,
to respond to questions and provide assistance to Duke Energy regarding matters
for which he was responsible and about which he had knowledge in connection
with his employment with any of the Affiliated Entities.  The Executive also
will cooperate in any potential or pending litigation or arbitration that may
involve him in any capacity as a result of his employment with, or service as a
member of the board of directors of, any of the Affiliated Entities.  This
includes, if necessary, meeting at mutually convenient times and locations with
attorneys of any of the Affiliated Entities, attending meetings, depositions
and trial, and providing truthful testimony.  All such assistance and
cooperation shall be provided by the Executive at such times, and at such
places (including by teleconference or videoconference), as shall be mutually
agreeable to the Parties, and the Executive shall be reimbursed in accordance
with Duke Energy s policies for any reasonable expenses incurred in connection
with the provision of services under this Paragraph 8.  Notwithstanding any
provision of this Paragraph 8, in no event will the Executive be required,
without mutually acceptable additional compensation, to provide services under
this Paragraph 8 (i) that exceed 15 hours in any calendar month and/or (ii)
after the second anniversary of the Resignation Date, except that the Executive
shall not be required to provide services under this Paragraph 8 after the
first anniversary of the Resignation Date with respect to any matter unrelated
to the Crystal River nuclear plant.  

  10.               Governing Law and Forum
Selection   .  The Parties agree that any dispute, claim or controversy based
on common law, equity, or any federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, or
regulation (other than workers  compensation claims) arising out of or relating
in any way to the Executive s employment, the terms, benefits, and conditions
of employment, or concerning this Agreement and the resulting termination of
employment, including whether such a dispute is arbitrable, shall be settled by
arbitration. The arbitration proceeding will be conducted under the employment
dispute resolution arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in
effect at the time a demand for arbitration under the rules is made, and such
proceeding will be adjudicated in Charlotte, North Carolina. The decision of
the arbitrator(s), including determination of the amount of any damages
suffered, will be exclusive, final, and binding on all Parties, their heirs,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Each Party will bear its own
expenses in the arbitration for arbitrators  fees and attorneys  fees, for its
witnesses, and for other expenses of presenting its case. Other arbitration
costs, including administrative fees and fees for records or transcripts, will
be borne equally by the Parties.  Notwithstanding anything in this
Paragraph 9 to the contrary, if the Executive prevails with respect to any
dispute submitted to arbitration under this Paragraph 9, or such dispute is
settled, Duke Energy will reimburse or pay all legal fees and expenses that the
Executive may reasonably incur as a result of the dispute.    

  11.              Applicable Law   .  Except
to the extent that federal law governs, this Agreement will be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina,
without regard to any applicable state s choice of law provisions.    

12.               Integrated
Agreement; Amendments   .  Except with respect to the provisions of the CIC
Plan and the Employment Agreement expressly referenced herein, this Agreement
sets forth the entire agreement of Duke Energy and the Executive with respect
to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all other agreements between any
of the Affiliated Entities and the Executive and any employment or severance
plan, policy, agreement or arrangement of any of the Affiliated Entities. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive expressly
acknowledges and agrees that except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, he is not entitled to receive any severance pay, severance benefits,
compensation or employee benefits of any kind whatsoever from Duke Energy or
any of its affiliates.  This Agreement may not be amended unless the amendments
are in writing and signed by the Executive and an authorized representative of Duke
Energy.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.  

  13.              Severability   .  The
invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision in this Agreement
shall not affect the other provisions hereof, and this Agreement shall be
construed in all respects as if the invalid or unenforceable provision were
omitted.  

  14.              Taxes   .         Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, Duke Energy may withhold from any
amounts payable under this Agreement, or any other benefits received pursuant
hereto, such Federal, state and/or local taxes as shall be required to be
withheld under any applicable law or regulation.  The obligations under this
Agreement are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code, or an exemption or exclusion therefrom, provided that the Executive
acknowledges and agrees that he shall be solely responsible for any taxes
and/or penalties imposed under Section 409A of the Code.  Each payment under
this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section
409A of the Code.  In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly,
designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement.  If
the Executive is a  specified employee  (within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code) then any payments that are required to be made to the Executive
pursuant to this Agreement that constitute the deferral of compensation (within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b) and that would in the
absence of this Paragraph 13 have been paid to the Executive within six months
and one day of the Resignation Date shall not be paid to the Executive during
such period, but shall instead be accumulated and paid to the Executive in a
lump sum on the earlier of (i) the day after the date that is six months
from the Resignation Date and (ii) if the Executive shall die prior to the
expiration of such six-month period, as soon as practicable following the date
of the Executive s death.  All reimbursements and in-kind benefits that
constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code
provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, without limitation, that
(i) in no event shall reimbursements by Duke Energy under this Agreement be
made later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year
in which the applicable fees and expenses were incurred; (ii) the amount of
in-kind benefits that Duke Energy is obligated to pay or provide in any given
calendar year shall not affect the in-kind benefits that Duke Energy is
obligated to pay or provide in any other calendar year; and (iii) the
Executive s right to have Duke Energy pay or provide such reimbursements and
in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.

 CONSULTING AGREEMENT

CONSULTING AGREEMENT   

This
Consulting Agreement (the  Agreement ), effective as of January 1, 2013, is
made by and between Duke Energy Corporation ( Duke Energy ) and John R.
McArthur (the  Consultant ) (collectively referred to herein as the  Parties 
and individually as a  Party ).  

  1.         
   Scope   .  The Consultant will provide advice and consulting services on
matters relating to legal, regulatory and legislative policy issues advanced by
Duke Energy before the North Carolina General Assembly and the North Carolina
Utilities Commission (the  NCUC ), as well as on methods and procedures for
maintaining good relationships with government officials in North Carolina, as
may be requested from time to time by the Executive Vice President for
Regulated Utilities of Duke Energy (the  Services ).  The Consultant will
perform all Services requested by Duke Energy in a competent manner using
reasonable care and diligence and will only interact or correspond with the
NCUC and other government or regulatory officials regarding Duke Energy at the
request, and with the advance permission, of Duke Energy.  The Consultant will
predominantly provide the Services in Raleigh, North Carolina, but may be
required to travel from time to time in order to perform the Services.  

  2.          
   Status as an Independent Contractor   .  The relationship of the Consultant
with Duke Energy will at all times be that of an independent contractor and not
an employee or agent.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that Duke Energy shall
not exercise general supervision or control over the time, place or manner in
which the Consultant provides the Services.  The Consultant will have no
authority to (i) bind Duke Energy, its subsidiaries, affiliates or related
entities, or (ii) act, incur any liabilities or obligations, or make any
representations or warranties on its or their behalf.  Nothing in this
Agreement will be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency or
employment relationship between Duke Energy and the Consultant.  The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Consultant will not be required to provide more
than 40 hours of Services pursuant to this Agreement in any calendar month.    

  3.            
   Fees and Reimbursement   .  During the term of the Agreement, Duke Energy
will pay the Consultant a retainer, payable in arrears, of $14,880 per month,
for Services requested by Duke Energy and provided by the Consultant.  The
Consultant will return all Duke Energy property to Duke Energy at the end of
the Consulting Term (as defined below).  Duke Energy also will reimburse the
Consultant for actual, necessary, and reasonable out-of-pocket business-related
expenses that the Consultant incurs providing the Services requested by Duke
Energy.  On or before the first day of each month, the Consultant agrees to
submit to Duke Energy his invoice for any reasonable out of pocket businesses
expenses incurred by Consultant during the prior month, with such business
expenses to be documented on a form prescribed by Duke Energy and substantiated
by receipts in a manner consistent with Duke Energy s policies and Duke Energy
agrees to pay Consultant's invoice for reasonable expenses no later than the
thirtieth (30th) day thereafter.  The Parties agree that, except as
specifically set forth in this Section 3, the Consultant shall be entitled to
no compensation or benefits from Duke Energy with respect to the Services,
shall not be eligible to participate in any employee benefit plans of Duke
Energy and its subsidiaries and affiliates in connection with providing
Services and shall not be credited with service or age credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual under any employee benefit plan of Duke
Energy or its subsidiaries or affiliates.  

  4.       
   Duration and Termination   .  This Agreement will commence on January 1,
2013 ( Effective Date ) and expire/terminate on December 31, 2014, unless
earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the  Consulting
Term ).  This Agreement will be terminated immediately upon the death or incapacity
of the Consultant, and may be terminated (a) immediately, by the Consultant for
any reason, at any time, upon the provision of written notice; and (b) by Duke
Energy with Cause (as defined below).  In the event of the termination of this
Agreement, as of the time of termination, this Agreement will be of no further
force or effect, and no Party will have any liability to the other Party,
except that (a) Section Three (solely with respect to any fees or expenses of
Consultant for Services accrued or incurred on or prior to the date of
termination but not yet paid or reimbursed in full by Duke Energy in accordance
therewith) and Sections Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten will survive such
termination in accordance with their terms (or, if no survival period is
expressly set forth therein, indefinitely); and (b) nothing herein will relieve
any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to its
termination.  For the purposes of this Section 4,  Cause  shall mean (i) a
material failure by the Consultant to carry out, or malfeasance or gross
insubordination in carrying out, reasonably assigned duties or instructions
consistent with the Services set forth in this Agreement, (ii) the final
conviction of the Consultant of a felony or crime involving moral turpitude,
(iii) an egregious act of dishonesty by the Consultant (including, without
limitation, theft or embezzlement) in connection with providing Services, or a
malicious action by the Consultant toward the customers or employees of Duke Energy
or any of its affiliates, (iv) a material breach by the Consultant of the Duke
Energy Code of Business Ethics or any other applicable code of conduct, or (v)
the failure of the Consultant to cooperate fully with governmental
investigations involving Duke Energy and/or any of its affiliates.  

  5.             
   Taxes and Compliance   .  As an independent contractor, the Consultant is
responsible for all taxes associated with any payment he receives from Duke
Energy pursuant to this Agreement and will indemnify Duke Energy and its
subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities and hold them harmless in any
proceeding, lawsuit, claim or demand pertaining to such taxes.  The Consultant
also will comply with all applicable federal, state, and/or local laws in performing
the Services requested by Duke Energy.  If the Consultant performs the Services
requested by Duke Energy at one of Duke Energy s facilities or offices, the
Consultant will comply with the policies and procedures of such facilities or
offices that apply to other consultants or contractors of Duke Energy who
perform work on Duke Energy s premises.  In addition, the Consultant
acknowledges that, while he is providing the Services, he will be subject to
the Duke Energy Code of Business Ethics and all other ethical standards and
codes of conduct applicable to attorneys providing legal advice.  

  6.               
   Conflicting Engagements   .  During the term of this Agreement, the
Consultant will not accept employment with or perform services or work for a
person or entity that Duke Energy reasonably determines, in its sole
discretion, to be adverse to the interests of Duke Energy or that of its
subsidiaries, affiliates or related entities.  If Duke Energy determines that
the Consultant is in breach of this provision of the Agreement, it will provide
written notice to the Consultant as soon as is practicable.  If the Consultant
fails to discontinue the conflicting employment, work or services within ten
(10) days of the date of said written notice, this Agreement will terminate as
of the date specified by Duke Energy in that notice, which date will be no
earlier than the date of the notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
6 does not limit the Consultant s obligations pursuant to Sections 6 and 7 of
the Separation and Settlement Agreement by and between Duke Energy and the
Consultant, dated as of July 10, 2012 (the  Separation Agreement ).  

  7.                 Confidentiality   .  The
Consultant may acquire or have access to confidential and proprietary
information in performing the Services requested by Duke Energy.  That
confidential and proprietary information may include, but is not limited to,
information relating to trade secrets, inventions, products, processes,
machinery, apparatus, prices, discounts, costs, business affairs, future plans
or technical data belonging to Duke   

Energy, those with
whom Duke Energy has contracted with regarding such information, and/or the
subsidiaries, affiliates or related entities of Duke Energy (the  Confidential
Information ). The Consultant will not, at any time, without Duke Energy s
prior written consent, directly or indirectly, use or disclose any Confidential
Information for his benefit or the benefit of any other person or entity.   The
Consultant s obligations under this provision will survive the expiration or
termination of this Agreement and are in addition to, and not in limitation of
or preemption of, all other obligations of confidentiality which the Consultant
may have to Duke Energy and/or its subsidiaries, affiliates or related
entities.  The Consultant will return all Confidential Information to Duke
Energy at the end of the Consulting Term.    

  The
Consultant acknowledges that the Confidential Information is and at all times
remains the sole and exclusive property of Duke Energy and/or its affiliates
and that Duke Energy and/or its affiliates has the exclusive right, title, and
interest to its Confidential Information.  No right or license, by implication
or otherwise, is granted by Duke Energy as a result of the disclosure of
Confidential Information under this Agreement.  Duke Energy reserves the right
at any time in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, to refuse to
provide any further access to and to demand the return of the Confidential
Information.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7 does not limit the
Consultant s obligations with respect to Section 7 of the Separation Agreement.  

  8.       
   Restrictive Covenants   .  The restrictive covenants set forth in Section 7
of the Separation Agreement, including, without limitation, the covenant not to
compete, shall remain in full force and effect until the later of (i) the date
they would expire absent this Agreement or (ii) the date the Consulting Term
ends.  For purposes of clarity, the Parties acknowledge that statements by the
Consultant solely to executive officers of Duke Energy shall not result in a
violation of the non-disparagement provision in Section 6 of the Separation
Agreement.  

  9.        
   Indemnity   .  The Consultant will indemnify and hold Duke Energy and its
subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities harmless from any and all claims,
demands, suits, actions, causes of action, damages, losses, injuries, costs and
expenses, including, but not limited to, attorneys  fees, payments, judgments,
and any and all liabilities arising, or alleged to arise, in whole or in part,
from or out of, in any manner whatsoever, the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Consultant in performing the Services requested by Duke
Energy pursuant to this Agreement.  Subject to the preceding sentence, Duke
Energy agrees to indemnify and hold the Consultant harmless with respect to the
results of any action taken based on the advice of the Consultant, including
all losses and damages resulting from any legal or regulatory action.  This
provision will continue in full force and effect notwithstanding expiration or
termination of this Agreement.    

  10.               Miscellaneous   . 

a)          Successors   . 
This Agreement will be binding on the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.  Any assignment of this Agreement, in whole or in part,
by the Consultant without Duke Energy s prior written consent (in its sole
discretion) will be null and void.  Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon any person other than
the Parties any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  

b)           Relief   . 
The Parties agree that the other would be damaged irreparably in the event any
of the provisions of Sections Seven and Eight were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages
would be an inadequate remedy for any such non-performance or breach.  The
Parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event either party breaches or
threatens to breach any provision of this Agreement, the non-breaching party
will be entitled to seek any and all equitable and legal relief provided by
law, specifically including immediate and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent any breach or threatened breach of any of such provisions and to
enforce such provisions specifically (without posting a bond or other
security).  The Parties hereby waive any claim that the other has an adequate
remedy at law.  The Parties agree that the foregoing relief will not be
construed to limit or otherwise restrict their ability to pursue any other
remedy provided by law, including the recovery of any actual, compensatory or
punitive damages.    

c)             Notices   . 
All notices, requests, demands, consents and other communications under this
Agreement will be in writing and will be delivered by hand, nationally
recognized overnight courier, or registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, first class postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be
submitted to the state or federal court in North Carolina.   

b)                Severability   .  If any
term or provision of this Agreement is deemed to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms and conditions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. 
If any term or provision of this Agreement is deemed to be excessively broad in
scope, it will be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be
enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law then in effect.    

c)                 Waiver of Breach   .  No
delay or omission by a Party to exercise any right under this Agreement will be
construed as a waiver unless the waiver is in writing.  No waiver by either
Party of any breach of this Agreement by the other Party will be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach.    

d)                 Amendment   .  This
Agreement may not be modified except by a written document signed by both
Parties.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties

Agreement.    

e)                 Counterparts   .  This

 PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD

EXHIBIT 10.64   

    PERFORMANCE AWARD AGREEMENT    

  This    Performance
Award Agreement    (the  Agreement ) has been made as of    ______________________    
(the  Date of Grant ) between    Duke Energy Corporation   , a
Delaware corporation, with its principal offices in Charlotte, North Carolina
(the  Corporation ), and    ________________    (the
 Grantee ).  

   RECITALS   

  Under the Duke Energy
Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as it may, from time to time, be
further amended (the  Plan ), the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Corporation (the  Committee ), or its delegate,
has determined the form of this Agreement and selected the Grantee, as an
Employee, to receive the award evidenced by this Agreement (the  Award ) and
the Performance Shares and tandem Dividend Equivalents that are subject
hereto.  The applicable provisions of the Plan are incorporated in this
Agreement by reference, including the definitions of terms contained in the
Plan (unless such terms are otherwise defined herein).  

   AWARD   

  In accordance with the
Plan, the Corporation has made this Award, effective as of the Date of Grant
and upon the following terms and conditions:  

    Section 1.                Number
and Nature of Performance Shares and Tandem Dividend Equivalents    .  At
target performance, the number of Performance Shares and the number of tandem
Dividend Equivalents subject to this Award are each
______________________________.  Each Performance Share, upon becoming vested,
represents a right to receive payment in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock. 
Each tandem Dividend Equivalent, after its tandem Performance Share vests,
represents a right to receive a cash payment equivalent in amount to the
aggregate cash dividends declared and paid on one (1) share of Common Stock for
the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the vested,
tandem Performance Share is paid or deferred and before the Dividend Equivalent
expires.  Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents are used solely as units
of measurement, and are not shares of Common Stock and the Grantee is not, and
has no rights as, a shareholder of the Corporation by virtue of this Award.  

    Section 2.                Vesting
of Performance Shares     .         

  (a)     Performance
Goal   .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, the Performance Shares
shall vest only if and to the extent the Committee, or its delegate, determines
that the TSR Performance Goal (as defined below) has been met (provided that
such determination shall be made not later than the first March 15 following
the end of the Performance Period, as defined below).  To the extent TSR
Performance Goal is not met, the Performance Shares that do not so become
vested shall be forfeited.    The Committee reserves
the right to reduce any vesting to the extent the Committee determines that such
reduction is equitable and appropriate based on overall financial performance,
including adjusted and reported earnings, capital deployment and credit
position during the Performance Period.    Provided Grantee s
continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has not
terminated, or as otherwise provided in Sections 2(b) or 2(c), all of the
Performance Shares subject to this Award shall become vested upon the written
determination by the Committee, or its delegate, in its sole discretion, of the
extent to which the Corporation achieves the  TSR Performance Goal,  which is
the Corporation s Total Shareholder Return ( TSR ) percentile ranking among the
companies that are in the Philadelphia Utility Index as of the end of the
Performance Period, with higher percentile ranking for more positive/less
negative TSR, for the period beginning ________________ and ending
________________ ( Performance Period ),  in accordance with the applicable
vesting percentage specified for such percentile ranking in the following
schedule:        

*When such
determination is of a percentile ranking between those specified, the
Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, shall interpolate to
determine the applicable vesting percentage.  

  Such Performance
Shares that do not so become vested shall be forfeited.  For purposes of this
Agreement, TSR means the change in fair market value over a specified period of
time, expressed as a percentage, of an initial investment in specified common
stock, with dividends reinvested, all as determined utilizing such methodology
as the Committee, or its delegatee, shall approve, provided, however, that the
Committee, or its delegatee, shall have the discretion to make appropriate and
equitable adjustments to the TSR of any company (including the Corporation)
whose shares trade ex-dividend as of _________________, provided, however, that
no such adjustment shall be permitted if it would result in the loss of the
otherwise available      

exemption of the Award under
Section 162(m) of the Code.  In the event that a company becomes a member of
the Philadelphia Utility Index following _______________, such company shall
not be taken into account for purposes of this Agreement.  

  (b) In the
event that, prior to the date that the determination of the achievement of the
TSR Performance Goal is made, the Grantee s continuous employment by the
Corporation, including Subsidiaries, terminates, the Performance Shares subject
to this Award are thereupon forfeited, except that if such employment
terminates (i) at a time when Grantee has attained age 55 and has at least 10
years of vesting service under the Duke Energy Retirement Cash Balance Plan,
the Progress Energy Pension Plan, or under another retirement plan of the
Corporation or a Subsidiary which plan the Committee, or its delegatee, in its
sole discretion, determines to be the functional equivalent of such plans,
unless the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, determines that
Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 3, (ii) as the
result of the Grantee s death, (iii) as the result of the Grantee s permanent
and total disability within the meaning of Code Section 22(e)(3), (iv) as the
result of the termination of such employment by the Corporation, or employing
Subsidiary, other than for cause, as determined by the Corporation or employing
Subsidiary, in its sole discretion, or (v) as the direct and sole result, as
determined by the Corporation, or employing Subsidiary, in its sole discretion,
of the divestiture of assets, a business, or a company, by the Corporation or a
Subsidiary, the Performance Shares subject to this Award shall vest upon such
determination of the achievement of the TSR Performance Goal, at such vesting
percentage determined by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole
discretion, by prorating on the basis of the portion of the Performance Period
that such employment continued while Grantee was entitled to payment of salary
(unless such termination occurs after the end of the Performance Period, in
which event the number of Performance Shares earned, if any, shall not be
prorated).    

  In the event that
Grantee is on an employer-approved, personal leave of absence on the date that
the determination of the achievement of the TSR Performance Goal is made, then,
unless prohibited by law, vesting shall be postponed and shall not occur unless
and until Grantee returns to active service in accordance with the terms of the
approved personal leave of absence and before November 1 of the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends. 
In the event Grantee does not return to active service from such leave of
absence prior to November 1 of the calendar year immediately following the
calendar year in which the Performance Period ends, any Performance Shares
covered by this Award that were not vested as of the commencement of such leave
shall be immediately forfeited (as if Grantee terminated employment for
purposes of Section 4 hereof).   Further, in the event that such determination
is made and during any portion of the Performance Period the Grantee was on
employer-approved, personal leave of absence, the applicable vesting percentage
shall be determined by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion,
to reflect only that portion of the Performance Period during which such
employment continued while the Grantee was entitled to payment of salary.    

  (c) In the
event that a Change in Control occurs before the Performance Period has ended
and (i) before the Grantee s continuous employment by the Corporation,
including Subsidiaries, terminates, or (ii) after such employment terminates
during the Performance Period, (A) at a time when Grantee is considered
 retired , unless the Corporation, in its sole discretion, determines
that Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 3, or (B)
as the result of an event listed in items (ii)   (v) of the first sentence of
Section 2(b), the Performance Shares subject to this Award shall vest upon such
occurrence, at such vesting percentage determined by the Committee, or its
delegatee, in its sole discretion, by prorating down, assuming performance at
the target level for the TSR Performance Goal   ,    on the basis of the
portion of the Performance Period that has elapsed prior to the time of such
occurrence (or such earlier termination of employment), and the remaining
Performance Shares shall be forfeited, irrespective of any subsequent
determination of the achievement of the TSR Performance Goal.    

    Section 3    .            Restrictive Covenants    . 

(a) 
In consideration of the Award, Grantee agrees that during the period beginning
with termination of employment and ending with the third anniversary of the
Date of Grant ( Restricted Period ), Grantee shall not for any
reason, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the
Corporation or its delegatee: (i)   become employed, engaged or involved with a
competitor (defined below) of the Corporation or any Subsidiary in a position
that involves: providing services that relate to or are similar in nature or
purpose to the services performed by the Grantee for the Corporation or any
Subsidiary at any time during his or her previous three years of employment
with the Corporation or any Subsidiary; or, supervision, management, direction
or advice regarding such services; either as principal, agent, manager,
employee, partner, shareholder, director, officer or consultant (other than as
a less-than three percent (3%) equity owner of any corporation traded on any
national, international or regional stock exchange or in the over-the-counter
market); or,   (ii)    induce or attempt to induce
any customer, client, supplier, employee, agent or independent contractor of
the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries to reduce, terminate, restrict or
otherwise alter (to the Corporation s detriment) its business relationship with
the Corporation.    

  (b)      
The noncompetition obligations of clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall be
effective only with respect to a  competitor  of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary which is understood to mean any person or entity in competition with
the Corporation or any Subsidiary, and more particularly those persons and
entities in the businesses of:  production, transmission, distribution, or
retail or wholesale marketing or selling of electricity; resale or arranging
for the purchase or for the resale, brokering, marketing, or trading of
electricity or derivatives thereof; energy management and the provision of
energy solutions; development and operation of power generation facilities, and
sales and marketing of electric power, domestically and abroad; and any other
business in which the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, is engaged at the
termination of Grantee s continuous employment by the Corporation, including
Subsidiaries; and within the following geographical areas: (i) any country in
the world (other than the United States) where the Corporation, including
Subsidiaries, has at least $25 million in capital deployed as of termination of
Grantee's continuous employment by Corporation, including through its Subsidiaries;
(ii) the states of California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyoming (iii) any   other
state in the United States where the Corporation including the Subsidiaries,
has at least $25 million in capital deployed as of the termination of the
Grantee s employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary  .  The Corporation and Grantee intend the above restrictions
on competition in geographical areas to be entirely severable and independent,
and any invalidity or enforceability of this provision with respect to any one
or more of such restrictions, including geographical areas, shall not render
this provision unenforceable as applied to any one or more of the other
restrictions, including geographical areas.    

(c)       
  Grantee agrees not to: (i) disclose to any third
party or otherwise misappropriate any confidential or proprietary information
of the Corporation or of any Subsidiary (except as required by subpoena or
other legal process, in which event the Grantee will give the Chief Legal
Officer of the Corporation prompt notice of such subpoena or other legal
process in order to permit the Corporation or any affected individual to seek
appropriate protective orders); or, (ii) publish or provide any oral or written
statements about the Corporation or any Subsidiary, any of the Corporation's or
any   

Subsidiary's current or former officers,
executives, directors, employees, agents or representatives that are false,
disparaging or defamatory, or that disclose private or confidential information
about their business or personal affairs.   The obligations of this
paragraph are in addition to, and do not replace, eliminate, or reduce in any
way, all other contractual, statutory, or common law obligations Grantee may
have to protect the Corporation s confidential information and trade secrets
and to avoid defamation or business disparagement.  

(d)      
Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 3, the Grantee remains free to
report or otherwise communicate any nuclear safety concern, any workplace
safety concern, or any public safety concern to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, United States Department of Labor, or any other appropriate
governmental agency without providing the notice described in Section 3(c), and
the Grantee remains free to participate in any governmental proceeding or
investigation without providing the notice described in Section 3(c).  

(e)      
If any part of this Section is held to be unenforceable because of the
duration, scope or geographical area covered, the Corporation and Grantee agree
to modify such part, or that the court making such holding shall have the power
to modify such part, to reduce its duration, scope or geographical area.  

(f)       
Nothing in Section 3 shall be construed to prohibit Grantee from being retained
during the Restricted Period in a capacity as an attorney licensed to practice
law, or to restrict Grantee from providing advice and counsel in such capacity,
in any jurisdiction where such prohibition or restriction is contrary to
law.    

(g)      
Grantee s agreement to the restrictions provided for in this Agreement and the
Corporation s agreement to provide the Award are mutually dependent
consideration. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary
in this Agreement, if the enforceability of any material restriction on Grantee
provided for in this Agreement is challenged and found unenforceable by a court
of law then the Corporation shall, at its election, have the right to recover
from Grantee the Award, or the Award s fair market value received by Grantee on
the date of sale, transfer, or other disposition if Grantee has sold,
transferred, or otherwise disposed of the Award.   This provision
shall be construed as a return of consideration or ill-gotten gains due to the
failure of Grantee s promises under the Agreement, and not as a liquidated
damages clause.  Nothing herein shall (i) reduce or eliminate the
Corporation s right to assert that the restrictions provided for in this
agreement are fully enforceable as written, or as modified by a court pursuant
to Section 3, or (ii) eliminate, reduce, or compromise the application of
temporary or permanent injunctive relief as a fully appropriate and applicable
remedy to enforce the restrictions provided for in Section 3 (inclusive of its
subparts), in addition to recovery of damages or other remedies otherwise
allowed by law.   

Section 4.                Forfeiture    .  Any
Performance Share subject to this Award shall be forfeited upon the termination
of the Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including
Subsidiaries, from the Date of Grant, except to the extent otherwise provided
in Section 2.  Any Dividend Equivalent subject to this Award shall expire at
the time its tandem Performance Share (i) is vested and paid, or deferred, or
(ii) is forfeited.  

    Section 5.                  Dividend
Equivalent Payment    .  Payment
with respect to any Dividend Equivalent subject to this Award that is in tandem
with a Performance Share that is vested and paid shall be paid in cash to the
Grantee at the same time as the vested Performance Share as provided in Section
6, or, if the vested Performance Share is deferred by Grantee as provided in
Section 6, payment with respect to the tandem Dividend Equivalent shall
likewise be deferred.  The Dividend Equivalent payment amount shall equal the
aggregate cash dividends declared and paid with respect to one (1) share of
Common Stock for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the
date the vested, tandem Performance Share is paid or deferred and before the
Dividend Equivalent expires.  However, should the timing of a particular
payment under Section 6 to the Grantee in shares of Common Stock in conjunction
with the timing of a particular cash dividend declared and paid on Common Stock
be such that the Grantee receives such shares without the right to receive such
dividend and the Grantee would not otherwise be entitled to payment under the
expiring Dividend Equivalent with respect to such dividend, the Grantee,
nevertheless, shall be entitled to such payment.  Dividend Equivalent payments
shall be subject to withholding for taxes. Any required income tax withholdings
in respect of Dividend Equivalents attributable to Performance Shares shall be
satisfied by reducing the cash payment in respect of the required withholding
amount, unless the Committee, or its delegatee, in its discretion, requires
Grantee to satisfy such tax obligation by other payment to the Corporation.  

    Section 6.                Payment
of Performance Shares    .   Payment of Performance Shares
subject to this Award that become vested shall be made to the Grantee on the
earlier of: (i) the calendar year immediately following the Performance Period,
or (ii) within 30 days after the occurrence of a  change in the
ownership,  a  change in the effective control  or a
 change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets  of
the Corporation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, except to the
extent deferred by the Grantee in accordance with such procedures as the
Committee, or its delegatee, may prescribe from time to time or except to the
extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under
Section 409A of the Code.  Payment (or deferrals, as applicable) shall be
subject to withholding for taxes.  Payment shall be in the form of one (1)
share of Common Stock for each full vested Performance Share, and any
fractional vested Performance Share shall be rounded up to the next whole share
for purposes of both vesting under Section 2 and payment under Section 6. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock that would
otherwise be paid or deferred (valued at Fair Market Value on the date the
respective Performance Share became vested, or if later, payable) shall be
reduced by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, to fully
satisfy tax withholding requirements, unless the Committee, or its delegate, in
its discretion requires Grantee to satisfy such tax obligation by other payment
to the Corporation.  In the event that payment, after any reduction in the
number of shares of Common Stock to satisfy withholding for tax requirements,
would be for less than ten (10) shares of Common Stock, then, if so determined
by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, payment, instead of
being made in shares of Common Stock, shall be made in a cash amount equal in
value to the shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be paid, valued at
Fair Market Value on the date the respective Performance Shares became vested.  

    Section 7.                           No
Employment Right    . 
Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon the Grantee the
right to continued employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or affect
the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or
service of the Grantee at any time for any reason.  

    Section 8.                          Nonalienation    .  The
Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents subject to this Award are not
assignable or transferable by Grantee.  Upon any attempt to transfer, assign,
pledge, hypothecate, sell or otherwise dispose of any such Performance Share or
Dividend Equivalent, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon the
levy of any attachment or similar process upon such Performance Share      

or Dividend Equivalent, or upon such right or privilege,
such Performance Share or Dividend Equivalent, or such right or privilege,
shall immediately become null and void.  

    Section 9.               
      Determinations    .  Determinations
by the Committee, or its delegatee, shall be final and conclusive with respect
to the interpretation of the Plan and this Agreement.  

    Section 10.             
      Governing
Law    .  This
Agreement shall be governed, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware applicable to transactions that take place entirely
within that state.  

    Section 11     .                  Conflicts
with Plan, Correction of Errors, Section 409A and Grantee s Consent     .     In the event that any
provision of this Agreement conflicts in any way with a provision of the Plan,
such Plan provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this
Agreement shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause
such Plan provision to be controlling.  In the event that, due to
administrative error, this Agreement does not accurately reflect an Award
properly granted to the Grantee pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation, acting
through its Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, reserves the right
to cancel any erroneous document and, if appropriate, to replace the cancelled
document with a corrected document.  It is the intention of the Corporation and
the Grantee that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to
Grantee under Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, Grantee consents to such
amendment of this Agreement as the Corporation may reasonably make in
furtherance of such intention, and the Corporation shall promptly provide, or
make available to, Grantee a copy of any such amendment.    

  To the extent
applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code and that this Award not result in unfavorable tax
consequences to Grantee under Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement will be
administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any
provision that would cause this Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A of
the Code will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which
amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the
Code).  The Corporation and the Grantee agree to work together in good faith in
an effort to comply with Section 409A of the Code including, if necessary,
amending this Agreement based on further guidance issued by the Internal
Revenue Service from time to time, provided that the Corporation shall not be
required to assume any increased economic burden.  Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid
accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the
Grantee shall not be considered to have terminated employment with Corporation
for purposes of this Agreement and no payments shall be due to him under this
Agreement which are payable upon his termination of employment until he would
be considered to have incurred a  separation from service  from the Corporation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent required in
order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of
the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would
otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period
immediately following the Grantee s termination of employment shall instead be
paid within 30 days following the first business day after the date that is six
months following his termination of employment (or upon his death, if
earlier).  In addition, for purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid
or benefit to be provided to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement shall be
construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the
Code.    

  Grantee acknowledges
and agrees that payments made under this Agreement are subject to the
Corporation's requirement that the Grantee reimburse the portion of any payment
where such portion of the payment was    (i) inadvertently paid based on an
incorrect calculation, or (ii) predicated upon the achievement of financial
results that are subsequently the subject of a restatement caused or partially
caused by Grantee's fraud or misconduct.    

    Section 12.             
      Compliance
with Law    . 
The Corporation shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable
federal and state securities laws applicable to the Plan and this Award;
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Award, the
Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock
pursuant to this Award if the delivery thereof would result in a violation of
any such law.    

  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Award is subject to cancellation by the Corporation in its sole
discretion unless the Grantee, by not later than       ___________, has signed
a duplicate of this Agreement, in the space provided below, and returned the
signed duplicate to ______________________________, which, if, and to the
extent, permitted by the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, may be
accomplished by electronic means.  

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has
caused this Agreement to be executed and granted in Charlotte, North Carolina,
to be effective as of the Date of Grant.
